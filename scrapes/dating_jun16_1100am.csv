0,What does it mean when a girl says I don’t feel chemistry,"I had a date yesterday and I thought it was ok. We held hands and we made out.

Then I used my usual line. Hey I like you, do you like me. She said I don’t know.

She made plans to see me again on Sunday. Then she texted me she felt no chemistry. What does that mean. 

For the record, the girls breath smelled like cigarettes. Turn off. I wasn’t really attracted to her. I still made out and held her hands. I consider that a success regardless of the end result 

Anyways I have two dates today so I don’t really have time to think about last night’s date. Just trying to get a girlfriend so I’m setting up like 6 dates with 6 girls.",dating

3,"Why do some men hate ""Vanilla women""?","Hiya. Earlier today I got called a ""vanilla woman"" by a guy who texted me. I searched up what it means and this is the definition that was most popular:

Vanilla girl
A girl who exudes elegance. A girl that doesn't go all out to impress; her simplicity is her selling point.
A girl not afraid to embrace her femininity and looks good in anything because she feels good.
Just like vanilla icecream, after all your exploration you'll always come back.
There's something that draws me to her.
She must be a Vanilla girl.

4,Guys the Victim mentality WONT help you,"I've been couple of years in this sub and that's what I've seen:


1. Guys complaining about dating apps and how unfair they are (while their profile is not even close to okish)


2. Guys complaining about looks, height and genes while putting 0 effort in the things they CAN change.


3. Guys complaining about ""ALL WOMEN want money or looks"", basically judging women that they are swallow.


4. Guys literally hating women because of past experiences(trauma).


I get it, life is unfair. I've been cheated on, rejected multiple times and judged for being short.


Instead of complaining and being a victim, get your shit together brother.


That's what strong men do. 


They go through adversity, they manage their feelings and they get what they want out of life.


Your today's thoughts are your future. Fix them, upgrade your self as much as possible and accept failure as part of life.


And most importantly believe that you're a valuable human being by default. Just cause you're born.


Hope that helps someone out there.",dating
5,Coming from a man (18M) with two tattoos one both of his thighs - why is there a tattoo stigma with women,"Hello all, I have two tattoos currently on both of my thighs.

Understand this, there’s no obligation for people to coddle your unknown insecurities and that includes frequency of contact. We have free will if that person doesn’t desire to contact you , they don’t need to. The amount of dates are irrelevant, had sex ? Irrelevant.

9,"Do you men realize that abandoning the role of the providers, and women becoming career oriented, means women will start to seek more physically beautiful men?","This is a fact some men are forgetting, it is a fact, there is a logical line that could help you to understand why. But I just want you guys to ask yourselves if you are aware of this, because you guys sound very exciting about breaking social stereotypes, yeah yeah we don’t need to provide, women should pay their part of the bill. Yeah some women are still traditional, some men as well, but a lot of guys here in reddit have made it clear that they don’t believe in roles. Fine! But women with money and beauty want you to add something to the table. You cannot make her fall in love with you with fancy dinners and she does not need it, so do you realize that at the same time that the provider role is declining, women are staring to require more beauty in you, to pay you attention? 

This might trigger some of you, but you have to give this a thought. It does not matter if you don’t like my post, this is the blind side you modern guys are not seeing…


Edit: I will stop checking here my dears because There are more comments than expected
My summary is: there are still traditional men who want to be providers, and traditional women who want to be provided and be housewives. It’s their view and Its respectable.
On the other hand, there are modern women who pursue careers (a lot nowdays to be honest) and modern men who are tired of being expected to be providers.
this is not about US WOMEN not wanting to split the bill. This is about US WOMEN accepting to split the bill, but also reminding you how this will affect you in the long run.
The thing is that some men are ready to stop being providers but they are not ready to share the misfortune or being also valued for your physical appearance as women have always been.

13,Paying for dates,"This has been discussed alot, but most people are not grasping the concept of why the man should be paying for a date. I'm a man btw.

It shows leadership and dominance in a positive way, which is what the girl wants. It's not about the money or that she's using you for money, forget about the momey for a second.  She wants the guy to be the leader and take care of everything so she can feel comfortable.

 Also, since the man almost always initiates the dates. It makes sense that he pays since he invited her out. 
Hassling your date for payment just makes it awkward and ruins the flow and is not romantic at all, at that point it just feels like 2 friends hanging out, which is not what you want.

It doesn't have to be an extravagant expensive dinner or event either. A simple Starbucks meeting should do. Then afterwards inexpensive dinner if it goes well. If she is only using you for free food, trust me you'll know early on.
If the man complains that he can't afford a simple coffee date, then do something to make more money. Dont complain. The burden is not on the woman, it's on the man since he's supposed to be in charge, I say this in a positive way. Women don't want to be in charge. They just want a fun laid back experience with you. 

Trust me I speak from experience, i always pay for our date, even when she offers I tell her don't worry about it. If the date doesn't work out then no big deal, it was a risk I was willing to take. Dating is a risk.",dating

For example new guy at my work just got fired for sexual assault ( he didn't do anything I was their training him but my boss( a manager) a female made a move on him grabbing his but he declined the advance and tried to report it to HR his first day 2 days later he got excused out of the building by 5 different police just to leave the building they didn't take him any were or anything he just had to go because the ( manager in question called and made a fake report ominously ) while we were all working he got black listed from the company and his bank account was temporarily frozen. It's not anymore but still it was dropped because of lack of evidence and camera proof going against what he said but that doesn't change the fact he is black listed STILL lost 3 months worth of wages from his previous job to pay legal fees just for it all to be dropped.)...............Details/background for this incident... ( he is young fit and attractive by most standards)... ( I only know so much about everything because I was training him at the time and I reached out because I caught wind what was going on from the manager in question bragging about it in the office).......  ( The company we work at well I work at is Taco Bell the management in general is just corrupt and awful with ""dreind mafifas"" running everything but this is a new low for local management even for low standers)... ( This settled like 2 months ago but it still effects my train of thought knowing it could happen to me)........................................ I'm lonely I'm not the best looking like I'm not fit sure I have decent hair but still if someone is willing to be that rude and just awful to someone I view as Superior to me physically, mentally and just over all as a human I don't want to see what would happen to someone like me that's not financially stable and doesn't have a network to lean on I'm adopted I live half away across the country (USA) from anyone I would even remotely call blood family and my adopted family are not close with me like that I'm grateful for them but I'm an adult know I don't want to be a burden to them for even longer......................................... I say this stuff but even being scared I can't help but feel alone it's not like I haven't dated before but the Dateing environment has changed so much and it's not the same as highschool and long distance is just as scary because of doxing.( I'm at a loss I don't know what to do. Or how about to going and finding someone or even where it would be appropriate to find someone that's not just self centered).......................................
Can someone please just tell me why people are like this or how to find other people who are not so self serving as to ruin others lives just because I say no to someone they want...................

15,"If you are not getting dates, don't blame women for having height preferences, materilaistic or that they are not great conversationalists. Wanna know the real reason? You are boring.","I know it's just a meme and some people are just having fun with it, but I am soo tired of seeing men making posts on Reddit because they can't get dates or make memes about women because they have height preferences or that they give one word responses. 

Here's the reality. You are NOT not getting dates because you're short, ugly or poor. You're not getting dates because you're boring and don't understand how to excite women. 

First of all, there's literally nothing wrong with women having height preferences. The audacity these men have complaining about women having some kind of physical attribute as preference is laughable. We are men. If anything we are WAY more picky in terms of looks. 

Secondly, being short don't mean shit. Tinder Swindler is fucking 5'9. Ok that's far from being short, but ain't 6 feet either. Yes, women would love to date someone that's 6 feet, but if you are a charmer, many (of course not all) women don't give a shit. Why do you think whenever there's a height post on Reddit, there are literally tons of women claiming they don't care. Because a lot of them don't!

Don't get me started with your career or your car lmao literally have not met a single woman who cared about the car that you drive. And if they do, believe me, you don't want to be with that woman. I once dated this woman. She was a pretty successful entrepreneur. We hit it off and started dating almost immediately. After 2 or 3 weeks of dating she admitted that when we were on our first date, she went on a first date with someone else not too long ago. He was a tall guy, successful investor who drove a Porsche. According to Reddit, this girl will be all over this guy but she wasn't. She even told me how boring it was on their date. On the other hand, she liked me not because of my height (I am 5'6), job (I am a graphics designer) or car (I drive a fucking Hyundai). It's because we have fun when we are together (we like doing similar things on dates and we have same sense of humor).

So why can't you get dates? It's not your fucking height or your fucking job or your fucking car. It's because you are fucking boring. Stop coming on Reddit to complain because you got rejected and then blame your height or blame women because you think they are ""superficial"". 

You got rejected because you are fucking boring bro and don't have a clue about what excites women.",dating

17,Please stop shaming men for preferring women with low bodycounts.,"I don't think I could ever date a woman with a high bodycount.

A rough analogy would be like when a woman finds out that a guy is lazy and broke. It's not as though she's morally opposed to the way he lives his life. Its not as though she thinks hes evil for playing too many video games. She is just turned off by that lifestyle.

18,Women - what do you say if someone asks you on a coffee date?,"I’m in my 30s. Very well established in my career. Am dating to marry. I only date men that are the same.

I’ve been talking to a guy on hinge and we decided to meet up today. He asked me what neighborhood I live in and said he’d make a plan for after work in my neighborhood. I live in a major city in the US.

Well he just texted me his plan and it is coffee at Starbucks. I’m not doing that. I’m not interested in what people think of that stance - I’m not putting on makeup to go meet a man at Starbucks after a long day at work. It won’t be fun. It won’t be romantic. I will want to leave 5 minutes after getting there. I’m not drinking coffee at 7 pm. I’m just not going.

19,"Men of all ages 18+, delete your dating apps right now!!","Hello fellow Redditors! So I was single for 3 years (January 2020- January 2023) For the 3 years that I was single I tried to use dating apps so I could go on dates with women and get to know someone. I’m telling you guys it was 3 years of hell in terms of my dating life. Women would ghost me, women would say they wanted to meet up and then just play games with me. One woman I actually started to develop feelings for but then she blocked me due to her own mental health issues (I hope she gets the help she needs) 

Needless to say I felt like I could no longer talk to women after about a year and half and I was still addicted to the dating apps! 

4 months ago back in October I decided to stop really trying on the dating apps. I still had them on my phone but I barely used them. Fast forward to New Years eve and my buddy Jack brings his girlfriend with him to our NYE party. Turns out, she brought her own friend with her! I started talking to her friend and we had some drinks and had great conversation. The night goes well and I ask her for her number, we are now officially together for a few months and we talk everyday. She is one of the sweetest women I have ever met and she is now my girlfriend. 

Moral of the story. I know it’s tough but you guys need to get off the dating apps. It’s way better to meet someone organically! The apps are so toxic and pointless. I know the saying is cheesy and cliche but it’s so true, “She will come along when you least expect it” exactly what happened to me. I thought I was going to be single for a long time after giving up the dating apps. Boy was I wrong!

Now to end this I am not claiming that just Quitting dating apps will find you a girlfriend. I apologize if the post comes off like that. I personally suggest getting rid of then apps for mental health reasons and it will also help you mentally and make you want to meet someone in person. Did I get lucky with this woman? Definitely but I mentally I have felt way better and more confident since being off the dating apps anyway.",dating

22,"men, stop asking men why women aren't into you!! 🙃","this subreddit is mostly an echo chamber for men to hate on women, and it's true regardless of whether or not you actively participate in it or realize this is happening.

posts here always are titled ""what qualities are women looking for in men?"", and the first/top-voted comment is something like ""the triple six: 6 feet, 6 figures, and 6 pack"". it's always followed by women giving legitimate feedback and being heavily downvoted/being argued with by men.

first off, 666 is for summoning creatures not women. second, if you want to understand what women want so badly, then why do so many of you ignore them? so much of this subreddit is an echo chamber of men thinking ""are we wrong? no. it must be the women who are wrong.""

look, i understand that it can hurt to be told some of your personality is just fundamentally flawed, but that's up to you to internalize and change. of course it'd hurt to be told ""you're boring"" or something, but it's useful advice! 

nobody wants to get with a man who doesn't admit he's wrong/doesn't want to change. if you think that women are so wrong about what they want, then date men!! its 2023 ☺️ you are valid!! but, don't think that women will magically want a grumpy, stubborn, socially incapable redditor who denies any feedback he gets.

tldr: stop asking men for things that only women know, stop denying advice, start trying to improve, and maybe socialize with less men who are also having severe dating struggles (because they won't help you get better).

25,I have a submissive boyfriend and he makes me very happy," 

I'm totally sure I'm going to be downvoted, but I don't care because I'm not writing this post to get upvotes, sharing my feelings with you is the only reason why I'm writing this post.

I'm a 25 year old woman. False modesty aside, I've been praised because of my looks my whole life, especially in high school, random people (both women and men) check me out when I go out, I tried using Tinder for fun some time ago and I literally got 30-40 likes in 1 minute and a similar amount of messages. I'm 5'10 and different people (even my female therapist) have told me I basically look quite similar to young Natalie Portman.

Everyone assumes that I put myself on a pedestal, waiting for the rich/good-looking guy who will give me the world, but I'm just not like that. I absolutely don't get any sense of satisfaction from sitting there and waiting for my man to give me the world, it's boring as hell and it makes me feel like a useless doll. I was born to lead, be strong and needed. This isn't just how I function in my dating life, this is what I'm like in general.

I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago and we immediately clicked. Relationship dynamics aside, we would talk all night about anything and have a lot of fun, we would joke all night, say cute things to each other, he's actually really nice to talk to. He's shy and a bit of an introvert, but once he feels comfortable around you, he really is cool.

He's really emotional for a guy, he's ''stereotypically feminine''. He likes cute things, he needs and wants affection, reassurance, encouragement. He's the total opposite of tough.

He seems to be really in love with me. I still catch him checking me out, and he looks like this when he does: 😍 I accidentally found out he saves my selfies. He describes me (to his friends and me) as ''charismatic, strong, smart, caring, beautiful, tall'' (we're the same height). He literally called me ''his lioness'' a few weeks ago and that was a really nice compliment. I really didn't do this just to feel wanted, but a few months ago I got mad at him and nearly dumped him, he's so in love he basically panicked and he was scared for weeks after that. He would say ''I hope you'll be in my life forever, don't scare me like that again.''

We both understand society expects men ''to act like men''. When we're out in public or when we're hanging out with friends, I make him look good in front of others and I let him look like the hero. When we're alone, sometimes he even rests his head on my thighs while we're watching TV, and lets me play with his hair, or sometimes he asks me if he can rest his head on my chest. I remember it was very difficult for him to reveal his true self, he was afraid of being seen as weak and pathetic, when he realized he could do that with me, he just let himself go.

He's absolutely as important to me as I am to him. I literally don't enjoy any other dynamic in my relationships and that's why I'm incompatible with most men. Again, I was born to provide, be needed, take charge. I wasn't just crated to be someone's doll.

26,Is there a point to dating as a woman?,"I’m starting to think there’s not. I’m 21, but already lost my libido and desire to date in general because of how I’ve seen 99% of men behave. It seems most of them just view women as collectible objects (they’re obsessed with comparing us to cars in particular). Then when we get too old, sick, our bodies change after giving birth, or they just get bored, they throw us out and exchange us for a new toy. Or they at least fantasize about doing it. Look at how many men are jealous of Leo DiCaprio. They all wish they could do what he does.

I was watching tiktoks of a woman who DMs taken men to see if they’ll cheat. Literally all of them do it given the chance. They’ll give up decades long relationships, kids, everything, just for 10 minutes of pleasure with another woman. Especially if she’s younger, because they’re mostly obsessed with teenagers. Every woman I know got cat called the most around 12-15. Or on porn sites, all the most popular videos are petite women with pigtails, braces and stuffed animals.

They’ll even say that women should just accept polygamy, because men are wired to want variety in women. It seems that we just have to accept being told we’re worthless after a certain age, that we will never be enough for a man, that the only thing that matters to them are looks, sex, and obeying all of his orders. Look at how many men say they don’t care about a woman’s intellect or sense of humor, just how hot and submissive she is. I don’t understand how I’m supposed to want a partner knowing all this. I feel very heartbroken because I’ve always wanted true romantic love, but I don’t think it exists for men. And if your only response is going to be “not all men” or call me a misandrist, please don’t bother, because I’ve already heard that before.

Edit: since all of you seem to have missed the point of my post, I’m not just talking about men I’ve personally dated, since that’s everyone’s only rebuttal. This is what I’ve seen from men in general. I’ve seen plenty of men admit everything I’m saying out loud. Why are you acting like I’m making this up?",dating

Confidence does not apply if you are not attractive or have attractive traits.

If you do have attractive traits, then being confident will help you stand out more and boost your chances of finding someone.

29,We need to have an honest conversation about Men's beauty standards,"Edit: Women are incredibly selective on dating apps. Men basically swipe right on everyone. 

As men, we have to be honest with ourselves- we are seen as objects on an assembly line. We are the disposable gender.

Women have most of the power on social media, and they are exploiting that power massively. At one point is history, it was probably true to say that men objectified women more than the other way around. 

But what about today? I think that the beauty standards for men are way higher than before, and men are being objectified at alarming rates. It's incredibly dehumanizing to be an average or below average man on dating apps/social media.

I truly believe that women objectify men more than men objectify women in modern times. But even stating this seemingly obvious fact causes controversy.

I asked em how long they were married and they said like 5 years. It actually felt like I was watching a movie.

33,Women: do you feel turned off by guys splitting bills on the first date/Men: do you split bills when you're not interested/financially not well off?,"Woman here. To me It's not about money. It's about the signal they send out. 

I feel splitting bills means a guy is not so interested and shows no appreciation of the time and effort you put in selecting an outfit/putting on makeup/traveling to the meeting location...
That to me is a turnoff, unless they make up for it with showing genuine interest in the conversation/asking good questions/walking you to your car, etc.

It's less about money, as I tend to offer to pay for dessert or the next date.

Do other ladies feel this way too?

Guys, why would you split bills?


Edit: someone mentioned paying for their own so they don't feel they owe anything. Yes contradictory to my opinions above, I do feel slightly uneasy if someone else bought the food I ate, so I always offer to split, and pay for follow-up things (second date, dessert). If I absolutely don't want to see this guy again, I'll ensure I split the bill so I don't owe them anything.
Most first dates are low key budget events, so I'd just like to see the guy offer and it makes me wonder about his interest if he doesn't as it shouldn't break a bank.

Edit 2: wow thanks everyone for your comments and thoughts. I like how divisive this topic seems to be. The mere fact this is still a debate in the 21 century is something.

Men: we certainly appreciate your putting in effort as well, to look presentable, to travel, and often to suggest the time and place. I always thank them for these things and compliment their humor or good grooming. And I get it, if you have to pay for Everything, it gets expensive, and how do you know she isn't just in it for a free meal, although I hope you're smart enough to suss that out pretty quickly. 

Ladies: I think we should always offer to split. Nothing wrong with paying for your own consumption. But in a setting where everything is assessed to gauge interest, the guy offering to pay is one, hence my turnoff comment. 

Someone asked why is the gesture/money used as a gauge, rather than the overall vibe, the conversations, the body language. Of course it's all the above. I've gone on to date guys who wanted to split on the first date because there were other things that went well. Why money though, even when it's usually a small amount? I guess as a woman, there's still that insecurity about when I'm having children and taking time off work and sleep deprived and all that, I want the ease of mind there's another responsible adult who can make sure my baby doesn't starve. 

Now onto gender equality: I call myself a feminist and am all for it. Why do I still have such ""backward"" views? I can certainly afford a date but still want him to offer to pay before I offer to split. I spoke about makeup and outfit and travel. Until we're in a world where a woman doesn't have to worry about her safety, doesn't have to check whether the meeting place is in a safe public space, doesn't have to text her girlfriends when she gets home safe and assure them the guy is not a creep, doesn't have to watch the uber driver when it's dark and she's drunk, until we have closed the gender pay gap, until humans really value the intellectual connection and the conversations they had rather than each other's appearances or whether she's attractive or not, until we don't turn on the TV and see 90% of the political and business leaders are men... Then, no, we don't have gender equality yet, and I'm still entitled to expect double standard.",dating
34,All my guyfriends are cheating on their girlfriends,"I mean it's none of my business what they do with their relationships but today i was just thinking about everything more clearly and it's just weird. I mean almost all my guyfriends have slept with at least one of my friends (or me). Or done something close to that with me or my friends in parties when we're drunk or high. We never let any of that affect our friendships and everything is always back to how it was after the parties. It's like what happens in parties is seperated from everything else and it doesn't count.

But still, most of them have girlfriends. Is it normally how guys do things? No one ever talks about how it's weird that they do these things when they have girlfriends. They also never bring their girlfriends to any of our parties and hangouts. I don't know why i'm making this post. But i wanna know what you guys think about this situation.

35,I’m tired of dating guys that constantly become insecure over the fact that I’m good friends with other guys platonically,"I’ve (25/F) been going on a few dates with a guy (29/M) I met on bumble. We were honestly hitting it off, had a good rapport and chemistry and then something happened that has happened to me a bunch of times before and it makes me so annoyed. He started distancing himself and became more emotionally apathetic when he found out that I’m close friends with other men. 

Two of my best friends are men, both of whom I have known since childhood. We grew up together and they’re like brothers to me. And this is something that has bothered a good number of guys that I’ve dated to the point where the relationship crumbles because of either paranoia, jealousy or ultimatums that I have to “choose” despite the fact I’ve never been romantically involved with either of them.

Whenever a topic of conversation with a guy i’m dating comes up that ends up leading to me talk about my friends, I’m starting to get the impulse to not even mention them and just talk about my friends that are girls just to avoid the judgment or skepticism. HOWEVER, I’ve always fought that impulse because I’m an open person and if I’m going to put in the effort to date someone I should be honest about who my friends are. Some guys have been okay with it, but really a lot of the time, I can just tell they feel off about it. I’ve had a guy flat out ask me if I slept with either of them and was skeptical of me when I said I haven’t. They usually always say something along the lines of “they just want to f*** you, that’s why they’re your friend.”

One thing I don’t actually mention though because it’ll just fuel whatever preconceived notions they already have about it, is that one of my guy friends admitted he had a crush on me, but nothing ended up happening and it was like ten years ago, we had a heart to heart and our friendship just grew stronger since. 

It just sucks that some guys end up being jealous over something like this, it sucks even more when it’s a guy that I really like and vibing with. The insecurity drives me crazy for real and it ruins a lot of the food that was developing. 

Whenever one of my guy friends is dating someone, their girlfriends don’t seem to have a problem with me being friends with them. Maybe one or two times it’s been a problem for them, but it definitely feels like I deal with this problem more frequently than them. 

Anyways that’s my rant, here’s to hoping I can one day find someone who I connect with and would be cool with my friends. 🙏",dating
36,How do I (f29) ask my partner (m48) for an open relationship?,"I have caught my boyfriend talking to other women in a sexual way, photos and videos of them together and separate, he invited multiple women over while I was out of state and I’m pretty sure he has messed around with other females while we have been together. We met in a threesome and I have no problem inviting someone in often. I have never turned him down and I have a very high sex drive. I don’t care that he does these things as long as I’m told about it but he still hides it from me and lies to me, but when I mention that I’m going to start talking to other dudes he flips out. I have been flirting more often recently since there has been no change in his behavior and he has been acting like I killed his dog or something. Is it wrong of me to want an open relationship?

37,36f single mom genuinely curious,"So I had my son by myself-in vitro, so there’s no dad around. I have been single 6years, since before he was born and I have not dated since, not anything beyond a 1st date like 3x I think. 
My question is: is it truly possible for a man to love a child that is not his own. Or do men only deal with kids to appease the mom? The 3 dates I went on ended after a bad reaction to me being a mom. I didn’t want to wait to tell them bc I think people deserve to know upfront as that’s a pretty big deal lol. Should I not have said anything yet? I will never date a man who sees my child as baggage. Kids are not baggage period. It’s so hard to have these very serious convos upfront as I know I’m a catch but men don’t seem to be able to get passed the fact that I procreated. And it seems manipulative to allow someone to like possibly love me,before disclosing the most important part of myself. am I just alone til kids in college? 😅I’m a very affectionate/sexual person but I also need connection to enjoy any sexual relationship so that also means I haven’t had sex since 3 years prior to my son being born. I’m a cancer so we’re basically born porn stars lol. So, as you can imagine, I’m really struggling and my BOBs (battery operated boyfriends) are gonna go on strike soon.

38,I (F24) screwed up my date (M26). Don’t know how to get him back.,"TD;LR - I had unprotected sex with both my fwb and my date. I’ve got Chlamydia, likely from my fwb, and it’s likely that my date would get it from me too (he’s still waiting for the test results.) My date has forgiven me but things will never be the same. I want my date back.
- Let me called him Shane. I met him on a dating app and have talked with him since Jan. We didn’t talk everyday at first and i guess both of us didn’t have feelings for each other at that time.
- But this month, he asked me out and i said yes without expecting anything. However, it went very well and ended up with sex. Few days later we went out again for a 2nd date and both of us confessed our feelings for each other. And we had sex again. Both of the dates we had unprotected sex. I asked for a condom first, then Shane showed me his negative STIs test results and then i showed mine (his was taken recently and mine was taken in Dec 2022). 
- In Jan which both of us were only texting, i had a fwb. Let me called him Aaron. I slept with Aaron in the late Jan WITHOUT a condom bc he showed me the test results of few weeks ago that were all negatives. That being said, i had unprotected with both Aaron & Shane.
- Between the 1st & 2nd date with Shane (Feb) i got my another STIs test done. The result was ready after our 2nd date and it showed that i got Chlamydia. 
- I wasn’t sure whom i got it from. Aaron? Shane? I contacted Aaron first and he blocked me right away, so i suspected Aaron got me this. (Also, Aaron told me once that he had unprotected sex with many girls but no issues about STIs at all bc he got the test done frequently.)
- Then, i contacted Shane and he was mad at me. I told him everything about Aaron. (I didn’t have sex with Aaron after I met Shane in person.) He asked me why i didn’t tell him that i had unprotected sex with a guy before him so he could use a condom. (I did ask for a condom, but i admit that i didn’t tell him about having unprotected sex with Aaron.) Yeah, that’s my bad. It’s on me. I said sorry without any excuses. I also reassured that i’ll pay for the treatment if he’s got Chlamydia. 
- Now Shane is waiting for the STIs test result. He’s forgiven me but things will never be the same. I acknowledge my fault. I’ve learned that i shouldn’t be relying on the test results. Just use a condom. What should i do?

*** To clarify, i didn’t cheat on Shane. We haven’t been exclusive yet. In Jan we were just texting, not even every day, after matching on a dating app. I slept with Aaron ONLY IN JAN. I met Shane in person in Feb. My mistake is that i had unprotected sex, not cheating. Also, i’d asked both of them for a condom, but they preferred unprotected sex and mistakes happened.",dating

Recently I've been talking to this other girl and she said she was also looking for a long term relationship and she thought I was attractive but when things took a sexual turn in our conversation I said no because I didn't want to do anything sexual outside of a relationship after what happend with my ex and that I thought it would be a good idea to wait and see if this becomes anything serious before we go down that route she then said she had no interest in a relationship with me and only wanted sex which would have been fine but 2 days earlier she specified that she didn't want that and she wanted something long term and led me on to believe we could have that but the second I said I wasn't gonna fuck her she decided she didn't want anything to do with me. I just don't get why nobody wants romance with me like yeah sex is great and all and I do enjoy it but I want cuddles and shi too I want romance and I want love but nobody I talk to seems to feel the same or they lead me on about wanting love only for them to lie about it and stop when they've had enough sex or I've told them I'm not going to have sex with them.

41,"He force drank water just so that he wouldn't have to give me any once I ran out, whilst hiking","I dated a guy for a few months. We once went hiking on a very hot day. He brought 3 litres of water with him whilst I only had around 1.5L. He only carried his water while I carried snacks, lunch and sunscreen for the both of us, as well as my water.

He knew how much water I had with me, from the very start. As soon as we started the hike he started force drinking. I could be wrong but I believe it was because he was worried that I would quickly run out of water and would then ask him for some of his. And to avoid this from happening, he force drank his water. 

After this hike I realised how selfish he was, and that we were not compatible. However, to this day I still wish I had communicated my frustration and disappointed about his lack of consideration for me. I often struggle with communication and being able to express my needs.

55,"Men’s advice. He’s handsome, in shape, has a good job, but women in his life don’t stick around. Trying to be a ‘catch’ is a Nice Guy mentality that never works long-term","You see it all the time. Guys list off their attractive qualities like a resume:

They’re tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they’re still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don’t have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they’re often befuddled by this.

It’s because attraction isn’t based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don’t have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the “I’m a catch mentality”. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you’ve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of “being a catch” you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you’re a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can’t, aside from just looks or money.

You’re likely too nice/boring. This doesn’t mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you’re this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn’t mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they’re seeing is willing to drop what they’re doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don’t assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities—you have to have depth.",dating

I’m an almost 28M, and I REFUSE to get married, have kids, be a corporate slave, or conform to the lame “mature crowd”. And for anyone who tries to convince me otherwise, GTFO! I am not interested in any of these things! 

I believe in “working to live” not “living to work”. I am ambitious about the things I’m actually passionate about (and it pisses me off that I discovered these late but that’s another topic). But my job is just a way to make a living. It means nothing to me beyond that.

I don’t want to get married. Or at least I’m undecided on marriage. I never got to have that “discovery phase” that everyone else got. I want that. I refuse to be the guy women settle down for once they have all their fun. And I refuse to marry or settle with the first girl I date. It would take a damn near perfect woman to change my mind on marriage. Especially if it were a first relationship. But yeah marriage for now seems lame to me. Also a huge risk given rates of divorce, and I refuse to be another alimony case!

And I don’t want kids! The idea of being a dad, is cringy, stressful, and freaking lame to me! Nuff said!

There you go. As you can tell I’m in a bad mood and I just had to vent my frustrations.",dating
64,Is Travel a red flag?,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good trip now and then.  

I just find that women who are obsessed with travel to be a bit of a turn off.  It makes them appear inauthentic and desperate for attention.

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I expected lol. 

Anyway, if you like to travel, there's nothing wrong with that.  

After reading through some of the comments, it's clear that there's a difference between showing travel as a way to share love with someone and using it for status and attention.  

It's the second intention that's clearly a red flag and what I'm seeing a ton of these days.",dating

- If you don’t like big tattoos, strong women who cuss like a sailor, swipe left!

66,He criticizes me in bed,"Long story short: I 23F is dating a 22M, and he is not conventionally attractive. He is shorter than me and begged me to date him in the beginning and was super nice.

But in bed he makes fun of the way I pleasure him and when I told him I don't finish and he is the only one to finish EVERY TIME for months - he turned it around on me and said his orgasms are not amazing with me.

68,Having to decide between two men.. one is 6 years younger than me the other is much older than me,"I can’t decide who to be with.. 

I am 31.
Age is just a number. In this case though the 25 year old who I’ve been dating is mature in his mannerisms and he’s intellectual. However he still lives with his parents, he has a good job but he doesn’t have plans on moving out from his parents.. cos it’s a nice house, and I guess having dinner cooked for him every night is too easy not to move away from. I’m also the first ever woman he’s dated, I also took his virginity.

The older guy I have known for 3 years, we started off as friends, then started being intimate with each other but he never wanted anything serious.. and I was newly out of a relationship so I didn’t want anything either. We stopped seeing each other when I was in a relationship a year ago, and just talked as friends. Recently we’ve become closer. 

I asked him recently where he sees this going, as I want a relationship and if he wasn’t serious then I would revert to going back to being platonic friends and continue getting serious with the other guy. He said he didn’t want that, and asked me to be exclusive.

Now I’m confused and hope I’m making the right decision by choosing him. 

The younger guy is very sweet, loyal and dependable. Older guy is caring, fun and the sex is way better. I feel like I have 100% trust in the young guy cos he’s innocent, older guy has been single for a long time.. He’s a good person too, I just hope he would be loyal to only me. 

They are both good people. I just don’t know long term if being with someone who’s never been in a relationship before, and still lives at home is a good match for me, but we are so compatible. I also don’t want to hurt him by ending things either.",dating

73,So tired of the way women with children represent themselves in online dating,"I gave up online dating because of an ultimatum: to myself I said I would be done if I saw one more ad stating 'my children come first.'

Didn't take long...within 5 minutes I was forced to quit for good. Just prior, I was so bemused with such widespread cluelessness, I took it upon myself to proactively and politely offer some unsolicited advice about not including that. It didn't go over well at all, I was backlashed harshly every time.

MY CHILDREN COME FIRST

Ya think?

A lot of guys relate to this. First, no shit. And here I thought I'd be able to usurp all those offspring you suffered for and are biologically inclined to protect.

I've read a lot of posts in social media from single mothers complaining about how undesirable they feel on the dating scene. Many not only used that opening statement, they also included photos with their kids. Why are you posting kid pics on your dating profile? Are you trying to annoy the virility out of every suitor? Don't you care about your child's safety?

Well you man magnets, you got us figured out. Men go crazy for ladies who immediately make it clear any man they date will be one of the least important things in their lives, not just sidelined, but actively  and preemptively shut down. The way to a man's heart is making it known he won't factor.

I know most of you pine about losing men to other women with fewer or no kids. If that's the case, why are so many of you acting so high-minded? I'm not saying you should dissolve all pride and settle for any low life that comes along, but you need to understand that kids are a lot of baggage someone else has to put up with. A new man knows he will never be their real father, probably never called dad, will be caught up in the drama between you and  your ex and the kids. And then there's the mommy brain syndrome that without you being aware of it, brings out mediocre traits that girls without kids just don't exhibit.

Those kids you have are not some new guy's fault, nor are they his problem. You should do everything you can to mitigate the damaged cause by the bad decision you made with that other guy. Yes, I know you love your kids and they are little miracles, but seriously, if that wasn't a bad decision you'd still be together.

Better Approach

Leave your kids out of the subject, text and photos in your ad. If the site asks if you have kids, disclose that question honestly, but only there. Don't worry, you will have plenty of chances to address this later.

Try being your authentic, adventurous self, the one that shares what she's like when she's in love with a man, or wants to be. Your life may seem boring with the kids, so share what you'd do with the time you WILL be setting aside for him!

If you don't put him first when you are supposed to be enraptured in romance, when will you? All men want their woman to be attentive. There must be a time when your man is first. Make sure your suitors know you understand this.

Ladies with kids, you ARE beautiful, sexy, fun, and alluring as you want to be. You might have to adjust your perceptions of what you want and hope. You can win the dating game if you think about how to offset the disadvantage of having kids. You need to sweeten the pot somewhere. Don't assume you can date as you did before kids, you aren't that person any longer. This isn't lowering your standards, its confronting reality. It's a good thing.",dating

82,How do I explain to my boyfriend that I need him to dress better?,"I (F) put in a lot of effort into myself. I’m just a high maintenance person when it comes to myself, I believe looking good goes a long way in this day and age. I don’t want to change my BF but I need him to dress better and look better for me because sometimes the clothes he wears really bothers me. It’s almost like he puts in 0 effort to make sure he looks good and that puts me off and makes me not want to be around with him in public sometimes. I don’t know how to explain to him that I need to him put in more effort into his appearance without making him feel bad about it.

Edit: I see how this makes me sound shallow and I apologise for that. To make myself more clear, I wish he put in more effort into his hygiene. So, not just clothes, keeping his room clean, his bed clean, his clothes clean. I like looking sophisticated and classy, he puts on anything he finds in his closet without thinking twice about it. Like bright colors that don’t necessarily go with each other.  I don’t want to fix him, I want to help him be more hygienic and dress better. And I want to be able to this in a way where I don’t come off as controlling or wanting to “fix”/“change” him. 

Also, he is open to change. However, I don’t want to change him all at once because that will overwhelm him. I want to start slowly.

• If you’re overweight, you’re gonna fail at dating. If you want a partner, lose the weight. Nobody wants to date someone overweight. Unless you’re into other overweight people, even then, it’s pretty hard. 

• Dating can determine your worth. If no one wants to date you, you gotta think about why that’s happening, and it’s most likely due to something you need to fix about yourself. This can be your appearance, your lifestyle, etc. 

• Online dating for women is actually pretty easy. There are a lot of guys who want a serious relationship, women just need to take time to look at people’s profiles, and if you find a red flag, it’s pretty easy to leave and find a new man the next week. 

• It’s good to be shallow. Dating is about finding someone you wanna spend the rest of your life with, so of course you want the best of the best. Plus, shallow people tend to know what they want and don’t want. 

Now before anyone comes at me, first off, I lost 50lbs and it made dating much easier. I’m actually happy about that, and I don’t understand why people are upset about that. I also know women who literally say they can go on dates for fun and drop guys like it’s nothing.

A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour. I mean dudes if you want to trow money at women to show you attention atleast get a prostitute, that way atleast you have a guranteed happy ending.",dating

93,Am I crazy for falling in love with someone 50 years older than me?,"I (21F) fell in love with a man (74M) about a year and a half ago. Of course on paper, it looks insane. I mean he was in his 50s when I was born! However we’ve been together for the last year and a half and I can’t put into words how AMAZING we are together. Now I should mention that he is very physically fit and can pass for 20 years younger. He did lie to me about his age when we first met because he was embarrassed, but after I found out, I found that I didn’t mind at all. 
When I’ve talked to people who don’t know the two of us as a couple, the first thing they ask is “what would a 70 year old man want with a 21 year old woman?” 
I’ve found that we teach each other things every. single. day. 
He teaches me what he knows about the world, and I teach him what I know about the world. We see the world through two completely different lenses and we’re able to come together and share those differences. He has helped me heal from past relationship traumas and although he has no experience with mental health care, when I have anxiety attacks or am feeling depressed, he sits with me. He listens and he holds me until I fall asleep. 
Our communication and our connection is unmatched. He will randomly bring something up that I was literally JUST thinking about. 
We have our disagreements and arguments, but we both hear each other out. All we want is to spend as much time as we can with the other before one of us goes, and I really think it’s beautiful. My family was skeptical at first because I left an abusive relationship about 6 months before I met him, but after meeting him they are extremely supportive and they love him. 
His son is a few years older than me, and again, was skeptical. But now that we all know each other, everyone gets along very very well. I have never been happier, but I haven’t found ANYONE with experience in this type of situation unless the younger is after the older’s money, or the older is grooming the younger.

94,Is it wrong for men to desire/want women?,"I don't know how relatable or ""wrong"" this is, I'm hoping I'm not alone in this feeling so I'll try to be as detailed as I can in explaining where I'm coming from.

So I've basically suppressed my desire for women beyond non-sexual engagements because it feels so wrong to want them and be attracted to them.
As I've gotten older... I've gotten an increasing sense that it's almost a moral violation for a man to be attracted to and/or want a woman.

I've trained myself to ignore beautiful women in public, my gaze avoids them because it feels wrong to be attracted to how they look. I don't want to be a creep or be looked down upon as an admirer. I don't approach women no matter how much interest they show me. I'm attentive in conversation, but I show absolutely no romantic/sexual interest even if I'm talking to a woman that I want AND EVEN WHEN THEY APPROACH FIRST... I know that I can't allow myself to enjoy it or put my guard down because I feel like it's wrong to want to touch her and feel her and be alone with her (it's a wonder how I'm not a virgin... but virtually every woman I've been with initiated because I feel like it's fundamentally wrong for me to).

Sometimes I wish that we as men could genuinely turn desire off completely, because having that option would make life easier for me and for women collectively. So many workplace, school, and societal rules are structured strictly to address this issue of wanting.

It just seems like men wanting women is problematic and wrong. It's almost the sole reason why I stopped actively dating, despite people assuming I'm one that is successfully playing the field (and I don't explicitly tell them that, aside from this core issue I'm well socialized, empathetic, in-shape/good-looking and likable. I say that to mean, absolutely noone suspects or knows how I struggle with this).

(After he mentioned he wanted to talk to me more about something I was like yeah I want to talk to you more about this other thing...crickets...) He always hugs me, tells me how good I look, has hinted that he wants to hang out outside of the place where we generally see each other, acts jealous when he sees me talking to other guys, is always fishing to see if I'm dating someone. He also gives me very nice and original compliments about my personality, etc. Very sweet. 

I personally think it's important for a man to pursue (that's not up for debate with me - if you don't believe it, that's cool....it's just not my thing). Anyway, is there anything that I can do in this situation to get him to feel more comfortable making a move?

99,Men are heavily discriminated sexually due to their penis size and I'm sick of it,"The dating market is already hard (pun unintended) as it is for guys, and then we, average or below average penis-owners, also have to deal with accepting that some women won't date us due to our size. Source? Reddit posts and real life experience

I understand that size and shape matters, the feelings are different. There are a lot of things men can change to make themselves more attractive, but nothing can be done about penis size. HOWEVER, women CAN, for example, do kegel exercises to tighten their pelvic floor and therefore feel more when having penetrative sex. Also, I would NEVER choose to not date someone due to how tight or loose their vagina is.

Why isn't this talked about more? Perhaps so many women that enjoy only above average or huge penises would be able to equally enjoy an average or below average penis if they resorted to kegel exercises

I say this because I've seen so many reddit posts about women wanting to only date men with big penises, or ending their relationships due to penis size insatisfaction. And also because my mental health regarding this subject is declining",dating

107,A 2 Year Personal Perspective on Dating from an Amateur Dating Coach,"Dating is draining, long, and a numbers game. It's emotionally and financially draining, and creates a lot of depression, self-deprecative thoughts, and all-around slams the self-esteem something fierce.

**Some perspective about me:** I have been dating for the past 2 years. I would guess I have gone out with over 60 woman. I am looking for marriage and children. I am educated, I have a good job, I'm fit, high morals, intelligent, have a lot of interests and skills, I'm socially adept (I'd like to think, anyway), kind and compassionate (I'd like to think), 5'10"", so not short, and I'm not that bad to look at, yet the kinds of woman I generally meet are low value, or almost always have major issues.

You hear often how men are always looking for hookups, even on women's dating profiles you constantly see so many of them feel the need to call out that they're not looking for hookups, yet I have had SO MANY woman meet me, hook up with me, then ghost or slow fade that it's insane. I've had woman invite me to their place, tell me that I'm not getting laid, then have sex with me. I've had woman tell me so many times that I am not getting laid (like it's their gift to give me, instead of something reciprocally given/shared) only to have sex with me. I've turned women down for sex and had them become belligerent, and I've been sexually assaulted by women in a way that made me very uncomfortable, though I was always physically not at risk.

The number of woman who are interested in dating and then come up with a wishy-washy excuse later is crazy. Woman who are rude about it, passive about it, and just down right lie about it is insane. On the flip side, I've had women tell me they love me a few weeks into dating. I've dated women who were bi-polar (clinically diagnosed), and more. I do most of my dating from online dating apps, and sometimes wonder if you just meet a lot of the wrong kinds of people there, but it's just so toxic for men that it's no wonder women are getting inundated with messages, many of which are sexual, and are only looking for hookups--men are sick of dealing with the game, and it's finally making me feel disillusioned and disenchanted.

I sometimes question/wonder if I want a women anymore. The toll it takes emotionally is huge. I give dating advice, and have done so for a while now, so through that I also come across many men (some women, but mostly men) who are having so many problems with females that it almost makes you wonder if the problem isn't actually just women and hypergamy conflicting with the modern world.

And when I date these girls, their story is scary in that it's ALWAYS THE SAME STORY: She was with some guy or guys who were abusive in some way. They cheated, or pushed her to cheat (it wasn't her fault, he pushed her to cheat). He is ALWAYS considered a narcissist. I have heard women on dates I've been on call their ex's narcissists almost 100% of the time. It seriously blows me away. True narcissism (according to Psychology Today) represents 1% of the population. That means I should date 100 women before I meet one who's ex was an actual narcissist. I hear these girls almost always bash their ex's, and they all tell me they were abused! If not physically, then sexually/emotionally. It's almost a 100%!

I can't help it anymore. I've read so much of the psychological and dating literature from some of the top-known relationship coaches out there. I've watched seminars, I've put it into practice and I've seen results. I've given advice to people who have seen results, yet after everything I believe and all that I know, I can't help but just become jaded. I hear these girls talk about how all they want is a good guy--someone with their life in order who will treat them well (unlike their narcissistic, abusive ex), then they lie about wanting a relationship, tell you how much of a connection they feel, have sex with you, then ghost.

You'll see them a week later with another guy, then you'll notice them back on the dating sites again because that didn't work out either.

I'm almost at a loss these days. There are amazing men out there. I talk to them. I coach them (my services by the way are completely free, though I have been considering starting a small business on it). I listen to their woes and problems and perspectives, and the problem seems more and more clear--hypergamy in the modern age isn't set up for modern day technology. It isn't set up for populations this high, communication mediums this broad, or online dating. I really believe that.

So I'll keep trying because I really want to find the love of my life. I have never even proposed to a girl because I wanted to find that perfect someone, and I've spend so much of my life self-reflecting and trying to become a better person so I could be the best husband and father ever, but finding a great women seems nigh impossible.

Give me your perspectives, gentlemen. And I wouldn't mind the female perspective too. I am not a women hater--not even in the least--I just understand the human sexual selection paradigm, and because woman sexually select, it all falls to their shoulders.",dating
108,Hot take: I would rather be in a bad relationship than be alone.,"People keep saying that you should learn to how to be single and happy, but this comes from people who are way out of touch, who forgotten what it’s like to be single.

109,"I feel like Women proactively ignoring / staying away from men is an additional mechanism to signal to men ""If I find you physically attractive, I'll let you know. If not, stay away""","In the past women were more receptive and open to men approaching - even if they did not find the man physically attractive at first. This naturally led to more relationships as the men had opportunity to let their personality shine.

Nowadays, it seems as the women are more closed off than ever. The common feedback I notice from women is essentially ""don't even think about approaching us, unless we make it OBVIOUS that we want to be approached by YOU"".  This takes the form of women putting their headphones, their eyes down, keeping their backs to you, getting up and leaving when you sit close to them at a bar / restaurant.

Although completely understandable,  the big frustration with this approach is that it outright eliminates 95% of men out there from even getting an opportunity, based on superficial qualities. This is because the % of men that women typically find attractive without knowing their personality is incredibly small - to the extent that most men, if heeding the ""don't approach unless we make it known"", would rarely ever get any opportunities.

I get the unwanted harrassment by men they don't find attractive, but I can't help but feel as if this behavior has another purpose - to further restrict the type of man that women want to talk to, based on qualities that have little to do with a long term relationships.

in the end this is going to further distance men from women. The bar for men willl continue to rise, based on qualities that have little to do with a relationship, creating a lot of lonely women who ""refuse to settle"". While the men will meet similar fates - either loneliness or deciding to forgo dating and focus on their own adventures.

I honestly think we are quickly headed into a society where the schism between sexes continues to grow - women will choose to remain alone. Men will choose to either invest a ton of time to improve to become attractive to women or choose to focus on themselves.

Call me nuts, but I predict than in 5 years society for those ages 20-35 will look like this:

* The vast majority of women choosing to remain single rather than settle. Settle being defined as 90% of men failing to meet the ""minimum standard""
* Men will bifurcate into two groups - one group will choose to focus on themselves or their careers/hobbies, as they either don't see persuing women worth their time/effort/money or they don't meet the ""minimum standard"".  the second group of men will be the minority and will capitalize on women targeting the top % of men by living a side life of hedonism - lots of sexual partners /  women / etc.

I know I'm going to get ""durrr your'e nuts"" responses. I know I know. But in 2010, I predicted that within 10 years online dating would rule the dating landscape and people would spend thousands of dollars on optimizing their appearance  - such as hiring professional photographers for online dating and their would be a big market for online dating coaches - specializing in how to portray the coolest ""image"" rather than connecting the the opposite sex. I got laughed at ""that won't happen are you serious"".

114,It is possible for men to date and want to be with women with smaller breasts?,"I’m a 20 year old straight woman. I’m fit and work out. I have nice facial features and my body fits my frame perfectly. My only flaw would be that I have small boobs. My bra size is 30C but visually they look like medium sized B-cups. Throughout my 20 years of life, I have heard women (98% of them with big breasts) say that any man who is into or likes women with small breasts is “just trying to be nice”, is desperate for a partner, insecure as they couldn’t handle a partner with big breast getting attention from other men (and that the man is scared she will cheat due to the attention), or that he’s a secret pedophile.

So I just wanted to know is it geniuely possible for a man to be 100% into a woman with smaller breasts? Like totally into her and happy with her and not wishing she was different or she could change? I really don’t want to be with a partner who feels this way about me behind my back and as a first-gen college student, I just don’t have the money for implants at the moment.

115,"Just admit that most of you are privileged, lucky and only date because you met your SO through college or work.","No one is impressed with these tales of bootstrapping your way into getting a girlfriend. Nobody actually has to reach within the deepest recesses of their inner being to make genuine, major changes in life. Nobody goes from no friends, no SO, no job, no nothing until one day they decide to hit the gym and say hi to women and suddenly they're dating left and right.  


Most people don't or should not be approaching hundreds of thousands of woman via cold approaching. Also, if you live in a small town then you likely shut yourself out of what little dating scene there was because everyone knows each other and they all know that you were 'desperate' enough to ask out every woman you could find in town.   


Nobody meets anyone through these fucking 'clubs' that you people keep bringing up like life is a Japanese anime where we all join clubs in HS or Uni. Covid has put a stop to the vast majority of any sort of social gatherings and trying to flirt with masks on is weird, not safe and just not really a situation to flirt in.  


You know how the vast majority of you people date on this sub to the point where you all make it a hobby? It's because you went to college and met your SO or you met your SO through work or through a friend. Sorry to say that not everyone can have or have had these experiences.  


So stop fucking telling people to just bootstrap your way to getting into a relationship. None of you ever had to make to serious, genuine changes in your life that shook you to your core where you had to change every facet of your personality and had to have 50 different hobbies, you're all average and vanilla af and you do the same bullshit everyone else does, you're a working stiff all week and you spend weekends on your ass streaming content or doing laundry or playing video games.

117,Dominant female rant/question…,"So hear me out… I’m 32F and into men. Most of the ones I’ve encountered (dating apps) are seeking submissive women. As much as I try, this is not me. Not in general at least. BUT…I’m noticing that with certain men that I look up to and trust, the submission comes naturally. 

I know what you’re thinking.. (omg, more of this Christian patriarchal bull sh#t and misogyny) No. and Christians are supposed to submit to each other, not just the woman to the man so anyone saying otherwise has it wrong. 

But back to what I’m trying to say…I get men tell me straight off the bat that they’ve swiped on me because they were interested, but when they ask if I’m the dominant type or submissive, I’m not going to lie, and they ghost. 

Dominant doesn’t mean I’m going to try and dominate the man I’m with. It means that in life, I take charge and I handle problems with ease. I don’t need much direction and I have a lot of self control (and maybe some control issues lol) What many don’t realize about dominant women is that we are reluctant to be led anywhere we don’t WANT ago go, including  away from our men by other men. We’re super headstrong and if we are faithful, good luck getting us to leave our relationships. - I’m not hear to say that submissive women will, I am just saying dominant women are not what you think we are. 

When the kids are in trouble, we’re not going to wait for you to get home and handle it or call you at work crying about what to do. We’re going to tackle the problem and you get to come home and relax OR also jump in on the action. 

When there’s a problem, we’re going to solve them together. Because there will be times when you’re too tired from work to come home and deal with the mundane dealings of family life and a wife looking to you for direction. 

Or am I missing something?

Tl;dr - I feel like a lot of people misunderstand dominant women and don’t want us. Especially men with traditional values. What is the real fear or concern they have?

My attachment in the relationship further and further diminished. Instead of wasting each other’s time I just decided to walk away.  I deleted her number and mailed pictures and gifts to her house.  I hope she gets the message that it’s over. I know this may seem “childish” or that I need to grow up but I just got mentally tired and drained from thinking about her with these other guys.

120,I'm sick to death of hearing men complain here that they can't get laid no matter how hard they try.

And many of them want nothing more than a warm body to snuggle up to at night (or during their lunch break) … as long he calls (or heck, even texts!) the next day.

The problem is the're desperate and always looking to get laid. And think that women owe the sex somehow. 

Secondly they  really scared of rejection, so even if the chance comes up, they find ways to avoid it.

Here's the trouble, low confidence leads to a downward spiral and make it harder for the to get out and try.

Men need confidence and can't be scared of being cocky around women. In order to gain that confidence, they need to actually talk to women.  

How about actually trying to listen to what she has to say? How about being polite and actually offering to get to know her by taking her to dinner, or lunch, or for a damn drink at the local watering hole? 

They think apps are the end all be all, that the number of matches they get, or the number of replies they don't get, after messaging 20 girls ""Hey waz up"" somehow shapes who they are as a person. They don't realize every girl on there has gotten 30 of those same messages just today!

They think they are looking for that one pure unicorn that isn't interested in sex constantly dissing every woman out there because he's ""looking for a long-term commitment"", then he might very well never find it. Except when they are the ones to finally have the balls to send that ""waz up"" in the first place. 

They think somehow women would be offended if they make any sexual advances at all. I don't mean right out of the gate, but in a world in which casual sex is served up on the menu like a cheap steak, women these days at least expect a man to try.

They have have ridiculously high expectations. They think although they sit on their collective asses gaming day and night looking at porn, with greasy hair in the same wearing the same stinky t-shirt all weekend, that they still deserve the prettiest of Disney princess Instagram has to offer. 

That shit ain't never going to happen. 

That fake tittied girl on porn hub isn't going to jump out of your smart phone and go to Red Lobster for a date. So if you actually want to 'get a girlfriend'. Get the fuck outside, get to know the regular  girls/women that you see every day, and you might be pleasantly surprised!",dating

I would talk to them via text for a few days or a few weeks in some instances, go to dinner with them, and then never hear from them again afterwards. I had a couple of situations where I thought the date went really good, but I get ghosted anyways a couple days later. Or I just keep lying to myself. Most recently, I drove 2 hours to another city, took a girl out for steak, dropped her off and drove home happy thinking I hit it off with her. I haven't heard from her since and that was nearly 3 weeks ago. 

I tried to approach women in person as well, whether it be at a bar, store, or coffee shop. Taking more advice from others. Not only were they complete failures, but they were all pretty embarrassing. I had a couple instances where they would just laugh at me. One almost seemed offended that I even had the audacity to ask for their number. I forgot the rule that only white guys who are 6'2+ with fluffy hair have the privilege of approaching women.  Society will tell us that female beauty standards are the worst thing ever (not at all saying they aren't extreme), however society would love to see the majority of men sealed away somewhere because the mere sight of them is an inconvenience. 

I don't know what to do anymore, however I do know i'd rather not be alive anymore. Sometimes I want women just to use me as avenue to get free food at this point. At least I will have the illusion of being desirable for a few hours in my meaningless existence. 

TLDR; No matter how much I try to better myself, I can't get into a relationship because of my race. However, some women would still use me for the free food.",dating
130,Girlfriend won't go on birth control,"Me (28m) and my girlfriend (23f) have happily been in a relationship for about a year now. We have an incredibly healthy sex life that has recently started to cause a rift between us and it's really worrying me 

We didn't start having sex until about 6 months ago. She wasn't on birth control because she wasn't sexually active. She's never been on it before, either. 

We used condoms at first, but they gave us problems. We didn't use them for several months and it was honestly my fault. I felt terrible about having unsafe sex with her considering everything going on and it was causing her unnecessary stress every month around the time her period was supposed to arrive. So we stopped doing that. 

But lately the condom problems are popping up again. They're killing my erection, they're making me go numb, they're irritating her vagina, and they're either slipping off from the lube or they are getting dried out and constricting my dick *without* lube so they're just bad all around. I've gone through so many brands at this point. 

Sex used to be fun and intimate. Now almost all the intimacy is gone and sex is becoming frustrating for me. 

I refuse to aim my frustration at her for refusing to go on birth control. It's her choice and her freedom to do so. But she senses my frustration and it makes her feel awful even though it has nothing to do with her. I really don't know what to do. 

She says she doesn't want to go on BC because she will gain weight. I try to tell her that there are several different kinds and some might not make her gain weight as much as others, or she could try to be more aware of the side effects and adjust her habits accordingly, but she shuts the conversation down because she thinks I'm trying to force her. 

I really hate this. I've had no problems with condoms in the past as a one time thing. But as a long term solution to birth control and a long term fixture in my love life, I just can't do it. 

At this point I'm about to say it's a vasectomy or no sex because I hate them that much.

131,Why do guys never approach me but only look?,"So F(22) here - I know I am very pretty, been told an 8-8.5/10. I have great sense of style as well & am a smart cookie (when guys speak to me on dates they are surprised & in admiration of how well articulated I am). However, I have never been approached anywhere by guys; library, park, cafe, restaurant (at times I’m often alone working/studying or solo date). They’ll just look and glance away.

134,Are men afraid of dating successful independent women?,"So I’ve been on a couple dates with this guy and everything was going well.  We talk and as soon as I disclosed what I did, where I went to school, and what my ambitions were, I was ghosted.  Similarly, with another guy, I got the “oh I feel like you’re too good for me”.  Another guy, I admire you, but I’m looking for a girl that’s more into family and less about her career.  I’m so taken aback, are we back to the 50s?  Women can’t have a family and have ambitions or a good job?  I talked to my guy friend and he said yea, some guys don’t like when a woman makes more than them, or are more established than them.  Is this for real?  Am I now expected to play dumb and wear an apron cooking/cleaning all day? #frustrated

Edit: the comments below did give me an opportunity to self-reflect and I appreciate that.  I first would like to clarify that I’m not Sheryl Sandburg (although I wish!).  I am not some high profile executive pulling in millions.  😂 secondly, I am honestly astonished by the number of responses that put women in a stereotypical gender role under the guise of men/women biological instincts.  At least to me, these roles are antiquated and I hope that we have moved on from that mindset.  I totally get that some women choose to be housewives and if that works for them great!  But to insinuate that you have less motherly instincts or that you’re less family oriented bc you have a career and have dreams/ambitions outside the confines of the house is very wrong IMO.  Like what if someone said that to your daughter or your sister?  Wouldn’t you feel eek?  I personally work a lot, but I have very flexible hours.  With my exes, I was always the one cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning bc I had the time.  I was the one who was pushing for a baby.  I think when there is a true partnership, it can work.  

But let me clear about something.  I am not successful or educated or ambitious bc of some pride or ego thing.  In fact, it just kinda happened.  One of the most valuable lesson my mother has ever taught me is to be financially independent and educated.  Why?  Bc time and time again, we see women sacrifice everything to be the care taker of the house only to find out her husband cheated, her husband was violent, or husband died unexpectedly and they end up completely helpless.  That’s why I was raised w the same opportunities as my brothers and never once told that this is a girls job or this is a boys job.  But having a job and being successful is not necessarily a masculine quality.  I still embrace my femininity (love makeup, love heels, love to dress up, lingerie, etc) and while I do enjoy the finer things in life, I equally enjoy the simple things in life.  But i guess I get the fact that I am very type A and Tom boy-ish, so I guess I’ll need to work on that cos I can see how it can be a turn off for some guys",dating
135,Males dating females with higher education,"Hi all,

What are your thoughts on males dating females who have higher education? For example, a male with a bachelor’s degree and a female with a master’s or a PhD degree? If you have been through that experience (dating and even marriage if applicable), how was it like?

Edit: I was advised to not date females with higher degrees because such females are more aggressive and have shorter temper than those who don’t.

140,Why women in their thirties don’t like it when men their age date significant younger (especially for relationship),"Hallo together,
my personal (male mid thirty) experience is that women my age react quite harsh, when men date younger. And I don’t even talk about really young (40-20), even if I as 36 male would date a 25-27 year old one, from women my age there would come pretty bad feedback. Especially if I am looking for a relationship (casual sex would be more ok). From my perspective that age (also up to 30-32) is a good fit, when it comes to starting a family (not immediately but in the next years…). If I would just would like to fuck around that would be „not good“ but far more tolerable for them as to say „I am looking for a women with an age at maximum up to 32 to start a family“. The classic answer is: „That’s unfair you are 36 you should also consider older ones“ Even that I have to focus on the ones my age is sometimes an outcome.

That comes from all kind of women, women that know me well or not really,that are in a relationship or not…. To be frank as soon as they are in their thirties (and i normally don’t tell like exact the „end dating age“) they get really pissed when it comes to, „looking for a younger one to start a family.“ And i always explain that I am looking for a real partner, with a real connection. I find that confusing.




Explantation of that age range that I am looking for, just to be clear: I want 2-3 kids, I want time to know and develop an meaningful relationship with my partner before getting kids. Money is not a real problem, but it would be important for me to have a wife that could work as well to have something on carrer and personalside as well. I myself were several years really focused on career (maybe a bit too much) and needed the time to develop as person and man ( had a long term relationship of 10years that cracked because we were not able to get kids.). To be honest my main point is just biological if I want 2-3 years before first kids and then 2-3at all, it will be rough with a women my age. The women in the range 25-32 are on the samephase as I am (i don’t date party girls for serious relationships).",dating

142,pretended not to know Pink Floyd to see the reaction of the girl I am seeing,"Today I hung out again with the girl I am seeing.
We drove to the city I suggested visiting and she was  so happy when I added that she could mess up with the radio. Since she wasnt satisfied with the radio, she used her own phone to connect It with the stereo in my car.

Then I did one of my tricks: I chested and lied to her :)

She strangely put on Shine on you Crazy diamond by Pink Floyd. One of my fave songs.

As It started she asked me: have you ever heard a 13 min long song? I said no (I lied) and she was like, how can you not know them??? 
Then she proceeded to talk to me about how Pink Floyd was more about space and music than stardom, about the images she sees when she hears the songs, she literally sees colors while listening to their songs, she told me the story behind the song, I pretended not to know it, and  she told me to pay attention to the words they used on the refrain (come on you stranger you Legend you Piper etc...) And she was SO ENTHUSIAST i could not hold the lie anymore.

So I asked about the names of the band members, she forgot one and I stepped in, she was shocked to know I lied all the time, made a cheeky smile and gave me a super light punch on the arm, and said ""you liar, I cant believe It"" I laughed and honestly It was so much fun. I had never seen a girl choosing a psychedelic rock song for a car trip. 

I will marry  this girl. She has the same taste the same opinions as me, she admires me, thinks I am handsome, she trusts me, she feels the music, she Is beautiful, sensitive and sweet and she looks gorgeous wearing those old fashioned dresses with leggins underneath. And most important, she doesnt snore!! She's quiet in bed and doesnt steal blankets. She hugs me in her sleep and nuzzles her face on my arms or chest. She's sweet and caring 

God, thank you for creating her. I never had the chance to discuss Shine on you Crazy diamond, soccer or anything deep with anyone of my guy Friends. So thanks for creating her, all for me.",dating

I sometimes get a bit lonely but on the whole I'm very happy with my life and finding my person should just add to my already full life. BUT the constant barrier I seem to find myself with is related to dogs 😂😂😂 

I am not a dog person, I don't want a dog ever in my life, I have my reasons. I appreciate a cute photo of a dog or looking at them walk by in the park, and the very occasional stroke. But like I say, I don't ever want one in my life/home. It just seems that most men I connect with want a dog and it then ruins what could have been something beautiful because they seem to see it as a dealbreaker.

Is there a nice way to tell people I just don't want a dog. Ever. Without it ruining an interaction??

152,So I have this move I do on EVERY first date I go on...,"So a bit of background for context, I worked as a professional matchmaker and life coach for a company called ""It's Just Lunch"" for about 6 years, I set up dates and handled feedback and maintenance calls with clients both women and men over the course of that time and I learned a great deal about how women think when it comes to dating during that time.

&#x200B;

So I decided to do something everytime I go on a first date, I call it a heat check. So I am always picking up the bill for first dates and I like to order a drink, engage in conversation and once she's done with drink one, usually this is 30 minutes to am hour into the date at this point, I stop her. ✋🏾  I tell her that I'm having a great time (if I am) I'm enjoying the date and the conversation but what I've come to know for a fact over my years of dating and matchmaking is that women don't always feel comfortable being honest, direct and straightforward about how they feel on dates. Sometimes they feel like they want to leave by they are afraid they don't know how the guys going to react etc. So I tell them at this point I'm giving them an out, if for ANY reason they want to leave, they don't find me attractive in person, they think the conversation is boring, they just don't feel the chemistry etc they have a free pass to go, no hard feelings. I paid for the check already or the bartender has my card so they can go. I then tell them I'm going to the bathroom, I'm going there for 3 minutes so they don't have to do this to my face if they feel uncomfortable. If they want to leave, call and Uber get out of there they are welcome to do so. I don't like to get phone numbers of women on dating apps, I prefer to meet and if there is a connection, and she wants to give it me, then we can exchange numbers so that I don't have it if she doesn't want to see me again. I try to get minimal personal information, I don't know where you live or work or your last name so I will not be able to find you should you leave. This benefits us both, if you want to leave but feel uncomfortable and don't want to hurt my feelings then you are free to go. For me, I don't want to waste time, money or energy on a woman who doesn't want to be on the date with me, everybody wins. 

&#x200B;

In keeping track of this strategy I've done this on 43 first dates so far. In 43/43 dates no woman has ever taken advantage of this and left. They all usually laugh and say no I would never do that. When I come back from the bathroom they have all been there and the dates have continued on anywhere from an hour to 4 hours longer after that, this obviously varies from woman to woman. And yet, I ended up dating exactly zero of these women long term. In fact most of them ended up sending me the dreaded ""I don't think we have enough chemistry"" text after the date which was puzzling for the ones who stayed for another 2 to 3 hours plus.

&#x200B;

I have a lot more context to add to this. And I feel like people will have questions so Instead of continuing to explain in greater detail I'll await questions. But i will say one thing, I protect my peace. I've found that reddit like many places has a lot of assholes, if your goal in responding to this post is to attack me and try to make me feel bad, I will simply block you, I don't engage with people who make arguments in bad faith. Feel free to disagree with me and make counterarguments I'm good with that, but if your goal is to call me not confident and attack my integrity just go ahead and block me first because I won't be chatting with you.

154,Online Dating is NOT about Finding a LTR Anymore.,"In my experiences and opinion, online dating is not about finding a long-term relationship anymore.  I know that there is no simple solution to fix online dating. There are several key factors that need to be dealt with:

1) There are more men online than women. So men are dying of thirst in the middle of a desert and women are dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean.

2) Women feel 'validated' by having 'all of those men' chase after them online.

3) Women are only interested in the top 10 percent of men. (Men 'must' be over 6 feet tall, fit, good looking, make over 100k a year, have a big D, pay for all of the dates, and entertain them. etc.) Yet most men just want a lady that looks cute and have a chemistry with them. (Yes, men are attracted to looks, but they also know a relationship is more than looks. How often do you see out and about a larger woman with a better looking man? Rarely do you see it the other way, and if you do, you assume he has money.)

4) The top 10 percent of men are chased by 90 percent of the women and thus those men can be 'non-committal' and be 'players'. 

5) Women are not happy because the men that they are chasing are not interested in a relationship with them, but refuse to 'settle' for what they consider 'lesser' men. It is not settling, it is managing your expectations and facing reality. 

6) Women call the other 90 percent of men that they find undesirable, 'creep', 'pervert', 'just a friend', etc. (Eww, how dare he approach me at a bar! What a creep!)

7) A part of problem is too many outside influences such as friends, Hallmark Channel, Romance Movies and Books, Postmodern Feminism, Current Laws, are all slanted to let women believe that they can 'Have their cake and eat it too.' 

8) Most men would be happy with just a single woman who loved them for themselves, and respect them. Women want more and are never satisfied. (More than 60 percent of all divorces are initiated by women who are not happy.)

9) Women want to be chased by the men they want. They want to be entertained by the men they want. They do not want to put much effort in keeping the man engaged with them. If all you have are your 'good looks', then you don't have much to offer a guy. (A lot of women have a self-inflated opinion of themselves and their looks.)

10) In order for a man to 'get' a gal online, he has to be a 'player' of some sort. A lot of men are just not players. 

11) Dating websites are geared towards getting men to spend money to talk to the women. Not so much the other way around.

All I ever wanted was someone to be a partner in life, to share the good times and bad times with. Instead, I keep finding women who are just interested in a free meal when I take them out, or to be entertained or just want money. At this point, I've given up with online dating. I still have a profile on various dating websites. Mostly to just browse when I'm bored and a bit lonely. But I do not reach out or 'favorite' or 'like' anyone's profiles. (Because that would 'validate' their profiles.)

I am not there yet, but I can see why there is a growing trend of 'Men Going Their Own Way'.",dating

How do i even change what my standards are for this? Does this even count as high standards?",dating
159,"I (23f) am dating a guy (23m) and he said he doesn’t want to get married until he’s 35, also he’s Muslim","So I’ve been dating this guy for almost 3 years now and I haven’t met his parents. His family comes from a strict Muslim background (even thought he’s not strict he drinks and is dating me etc.) 
We recently had a conversation about our future and he said he doesn’t want to get married until 35, he said he wants to enjoy his life before he has to settle down. He also mentioned that because of his religion, he can’t introduce me to his mom until he’s ready to propose and I have converted to Islam. We spoke about me converting and I said I said I was willing to convert if we were to marry. Theoretically speaking I would have to be with him for another 10 years without meeting his family which is too far away because I want to be involved in my boyfriends life and be involved with his family too. I’ve been having mixed feeling recently of wether or not this man is right for me. I intend to get married by 28 at least (family is very important for me) so I’m conflicted. Should I stay and wait to get married at 35 or move on? I love him a lot and he loves me so it’s going to be hard to move on if I have to but I just want to do what’s right.

160,ive officially decided.,"Okay all, as the title says, ive officially decided that A LOT (not all) of women have no clue whatsoever what a conversation is. In the last few weeks ive had about 40 matches via bumble, tinder and hinge. Every single match, the conversation has been DEADDDD.

And i know i know, you're think ""well have you ever thought you may be the one that sucks at them?""

Ive considered it but its not true. Ive had no issues ever before socially, dating, friends, family etc. I talk too much of anything.

Bumble - girl messages first. Every message except 1 or 2 has been hey how are you?

Tinder - the women on there do not know how to say anything past hey how are you?

Hinge - 99% of the time the girl matches and expects the guy to message. Ok, so i message something interesting or whatever. Deaddddddd answers. I stop.

Ive come to this conclusion for sure.",dating
161,Why is it so uncommon to have sex on first/second date?,"I know it’s an unpopular opinion, but I much rather have physical connection before emotional. My ideal first date is going on a dinner, getting to know each other and then head back to my or her place to have sex. This however doesn’t mean I am looking for ons or fwb. But sex is really important to me in a relationship. If it doesn’t work well, it’s just impossible to maintain that relationship (I already had a relationship ruined simply because we were sexually so incompatible). So, why would I go on several dates, invest in a relationship emotionally in hopes that sex will be good? When you can simply figure it out by having sex early on. I really don’t see why the social norm is dating for a while before having sex.",dating

During my High School years i was very shy and overweight so no girls were interested in me, for good reason. I've been working on that and feel that i am now dateable. The problem is that i want to have first relationship with someone just like me, with with few or no previous experience with romantic relationships who's also a virgin.

My question is, how do you guys think i can find someone like that? Where do the shy, virgin girls hang out? Should i take art classes, talk to them online? I'm desperate for advice.",dating
163,Confessions of a Fuckboy,"Hello. I am happily married, with a family. My spouse and I love each other a great deal. Our marriage is good. The sort of thing you read about.

But I used to be a fuckboy.

Oh, yes. All the things that get complained out on Reddit dating sites? I did them. Stringing people along without committing? Common for me. Having sex but then busting out the ""not looking for anything"" line? I did it. Commitment-phobia? Big time. Emotionally unavailable? Very. Ghosting? My phone didn't even recognize the word ""bye"" after a while. I had a bunch of fuckboy friends. Some are now married. some are not.

I know what you're asking right now. But no, I don't want your number or your snapchat.

So, what happened? How does a legendary fuckboy like me end up married, committed and happy? Well, I found someone worth committing to. Someone unique, who, in losing, I would never find again. Someone who is a real catch. In short, I found someone is good enough. 

That's the thing about fuckboys. They're not stupid. They just don't commit until they know that they found someone to whom it is appealing to commit.",dating
164,How can we make online dating safer?,"I am DONE tolerating harassment on dating platforms like Bumble. I envision a world where we are equipped to warn our fellow daters about those who fail to respect boundaries and display inappropriate behavior.

  
What if we had the power to shine a light on these individuals, not for revenge, but for the protection of our community? Imagine an anonymous review feature that allows us to share our experiences and insights about our dates. These reviews would be available as a summary on the user's profile, providing valuable information to others before they even swipe right while not exposing the individual reviewer.

  
This is not just about exposing those who do not understand respect and consent; it is about cultivating a culture of accountability, respect, and safety within our dating environments.  
I am prepared to dedicate myself to this cause, to sift through the crowd and highlight those who pose a potential threat. By doing so, we can ensure that they do not find another victim, another person left feeling objectified, disrespected, or worse.

  
This isn't just a feature - it's a MOVEMENT. It's about ensuring our voices are heard, our experiences validated, and our safety prioritized. Who's with me in demanding more from our dating apps? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",dating
165,Can you tell me honestly if you think my standards are too high?,"25F interested in men. Been single for 3ish years. I’ve had hinge for 6 months & it’s not going so well. I can’t tell if I am just too picky or if I just have standards and it’s OK. Not to sound conceited but I think I’m rather attractive (dress well, take care of myself), relatively intelligent, active, outdoorsy, good sense of humour (wouldn’t say funny lol) & kind. 

This is what I’m looking for in a guy: kind, funny, smart, well paying job (My big dream has always been lots of children & to be a SAHM… need money for that), super outdoorsy, takes care of themselves, decent personal style (doesn’t have to be a fashion icon lol but just has some sense of personal style), someone I’m attracted to, can be social & hold his own (don’t wanna babysit), patient, characteristics of a good father, and mature. 

If anyone could give me their honest opinion I would appreciate it. Is this too much? Is it bad that I decline 98% of guys that like me on dating apps? Am I the problem lol?




Edit: I wonder if maybe it’s too difficult to tell all of this through dating app pictures so I never give anyone a chance really? Idk help lol

166,"No Marriage, No Sex","  
I've met a guy last year and I’ve never liked anybody this much. We have so much fun together and get along so well. We’ve been dating for a few months now and I am seriously falling for this guy. The only thing is I am saving myself for marriage and the only form of release he gets is jerking off onto my stomach. I won't let him give me oral but I am fine giving him bj. I know he totally respect my wishes but it’s leaving him feeling sexually unsatisfied and I am afraid this could be the reason for him to leave me. I am no prude or conservative, it's just a matter of principle/ideals. What to do?",dating
167,"I would like to have a relationship, but I genuinely do not find a reason to date girls. Am I missing something?","I'm a 25 year old guy, I'm totally straight.  I've genuinely questioned my sexuality, I'm an open-minded person and if I was gay or bisexual I'd be honest with myself and start dating guys, but I'm straight.

My problem is that even though I like women, physical attraction isn't enough for me. If the most attractive girl on the planet walks past me on the sidewalk, I won't even notice. She could be half naked and I still won't care.

I only value what a woman brings to the table. It doesn't matter if what she offers is financial support, emotional support or something else, what matters is that she has to bring something to the table that makes me want to date her,  and then I'll try to understand if I find her attractive.  I've only had 3 relationships in my life (I'll talk about the last one later)

The problem is that I feel like men like me have no place in the dating market. I meet a woman and she'll just start giving me a lot of hints.  False modesty aside, I'm not an ugly guy at all, women giving me hints is not a very rare occurrance. But if even if she's giving me the green light to go ahead, I do not find a reason to go ahead because if you're just sitting there and giving me hints, then you're basically just hoping I find you attractive sexually, you're not really doing anything to make me want to date you.

I'll talk about the last relationship that I had: I meet this girl in University. She was very cute, not my type, but I eventually fell for her.

She found me attractive immediately and asked ''what's your name?''. She would sit next to me during the classes and try to tease me.  She would rub her leg against mine under the desk, touch my arm a lot during conversations etc. She would go out of her way to help me with the studies. She did that for a few months, I was initially indifferent to her, I just thought she was a nice girl, but I wasn't into her. At some point I realized ''this girl is cute and she's a very kind person, I think I'm in love''. Now this is a girl who gave me real reasons to take things further, she didn't just sit there and wait for me to do the rest of the work, I won't do that because looks alone don't turn me on. I think I've explained pretty clearly how I function. But unfortunately women like this are the exception, I wish they were the rule.

I'm starting to think I'll only have a woman when I want to start a family, having kids and a family may be a good reason for me to seek a relationship and make an effort,  but this means I'll have to stay single for many years. I just do not look at a woman and think ''I want her''.

I cannot change how I function, I'd have to go get a different brain that works differently. What am I supposed to do?",dating
168,"My son's are good looking athletic and hardworking, and can't find girls. How can I help them?"," EDITED
Ladies, please help me to help my sons. Yes, they're on the usual dating apps, but never seem to get many actual dates out of it. My sons chose to leave good paying jobs and even left their homeland because they didn't agree with the politics there. They are  good-looking, athletic and hard working. WHERE CAN MY SONS GO TO FIND WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE? This is a sincere question, so please, only sincere responses.
(EDIT/CLARIFICATION BY OP)
Thank you so much for those of you who responded to my question in sincerity and with a desire to be helpful. Many of your responses were helpful or at least encouraging. There were many other responses that seemed to genuinely misconstrue my intentions and offered advice that was consistent with mistaken suppositions about me and my intentions. And then, sadly there were some who seemed intent on being as insulting or rude as possible. To those who simply misconstrued my question, I offer these clarifications. If, after reading the clarification, you have some suggestions that might be helpful to any man wanting to meet girls in the modern dating world, please feel free to follow up. 

1.  The question I originally asked is: ""where can my sons go to find women of substance?"". My point here was to ask the young women of Reddit, ""where can my sons look to find you?"".  My question was NOT, ""how can I interfere in my sons' romantic and sexual lives"". 
2. I'm their Dad. I'm asking the question because things have changed in the dating world since I was there. I thought Reddit might be a way for me to learn something that helps them to be more effective in their search. My sons often ask my advice about life and have repeatedly expressed frustration with the difficulty meeting young women. 
3. My son's politics, looks, upbringing, attitudes etc are really not relevant to this conversation. I'm simply looking for insights that would work for ANY man in the dating world. 
4. The only reason I brought up politics, was as a measure of the character that my sons have. It takes courage and conviction to be willing to leave jobs, friends and country to live up to your ideals. I would have thought that their willingness to sacrifice for their convictions (right or wrong) would be a good measuring stick for a young woman trying to ascertain what kind of men they are. 
5. What do I mean by the phrase ""woman of substance""?. I mean a woman who is kind, courageous, hardworking, has a sense of humor, and an open mind.  A woman of substance is firmly committed to overcome adversity and be her best self and live her best life. I'm sure that I could expand on this definition but I think you get my drift.
6. I feel a fatherly compulsion to defend my sons, so here we go. They have faults of course, but they are the kind of people you would hope come along if you were in distress or in danger or just needed a friend. Many times, I have seen them act with compassion and integrity when they think no one is watching. In short, they are men of substance.",dating
169,People that refuse to use dating apps are holding themselves back,"In my personal life and on this sub, I've noticed a huge correlation between not using/refusing to use datings apps and a lack of dates. I truly don't understand how people meet others organically anymore, and I don't really understand the pressure behind meeting someone this way vs. online. A lot of people on here complain about a lack of dates, yet refuse to put themselves out there and even give online dating a chance. In the past few years, online dating has become so normalized and acceptable that people are very open about using dating apps and their online dating practices. Even in the past year, with everything going on in the world, it's nearly impossible to meet someone organically since we don't have the freedom to go out like we once did. For those who refuse to use dating apps, they're just doing themselves a disservice and truly holding themselves back from meeting someone great.",dating
170,Coffee dates vs dinner dates, What is it with guys mostly offering coffee dates? Lately been getting first date invites from guys but it’ll be for drinks or out to a coffee shop… I’m use to getting asked out to dinner.

171,"If you’re dating someone and that person throws any hints about how he or she isn’t certain about your relationship, end it immediately.","I don’t care what excuse the other person makes. 

I’m going through a lot. Theyre having anxiety or depression or something else..ok that’s fine...but if you want to date long term, what are you going to do if you have post partum depression after the baby is born...what are you going to do if you’ve dated and you find out one of you has a chronic condition...would you run then too? 

I’m busy at work but I won’t offer a time I will be free to spend time with you. 

Our chemistry isn’t the same as it used to be. 

End it. 

Excuses as valid as some might be are at the end of the day...excuses.

“Yeah, ‘insert your name here’ never does that”

“I really wish ‘insert your name here’ liked this as much as I do”

“Loool, yeah I remember when ‘insert your name here’ did this ‘insert extremely embarrassing thing’, it was hilarious”

Basically, fronting you as stupid, lesser, or uncaring in front of others is a big no-no.

Joking around is something different, but if its visibly at your expense, and they are using adverbs like ‘always’ and ‘never’, it is not a good sign.",dating
173,Guy I was casual with ended it for a 19 year old girl?,"We had been casual for 4 weeks he (34m) and I (31f). He told me he didn’t want anything serious and neither did I, I felt he kept trying to get emotional support off me and relationship benefits so I kept a distance.

The last time I saw him he messaged a girl in front of me to make me jealous as he thought I was messaging another guy! This caused an argument between us.

The girl he was messaging as we was in bed he has spent 3 nights with! She’s 19 and has been posting indirect posts all over her Instagram to hint she’s with him. I confronted him over it to which he hasn’t replied.

Today she was stalking my social media, liking my posts, posting indirect statuses about me that there is no competition and I will never be her (I should hope not I have a lot going for me, she’s 19 for god sake).

She was checking everything I posted all day so I messaged him and told him to sort her out and this is what happens when he gets involved with kids and god help him how she will be when he’s bored of her.

Straight away they then both blocked me on social media, but I noticed he hasn’t blocked my number or WhatsApp and that’s what we last had contact on. 

Why do you think he would of replaced me with her? And not block my number?",dating
174,He first has sex with me then tells me that I'm not his type - can you go lower than this?,"I (37 F) meet this guy (38M) on a dating app. I live in Europe, he lives in the US. Lots of messages, and video calls for 4 months, lots of things in common, (allegedly) values, principles, views on life and death, similar lifestyles etc.  
He lovebombs the shit out of me.  
He decides to come here to see me and stay at my place indefinitely.  
One month before he came here he told me in a very subtle and hurtful way that he was worried about my body (i'm 5'8 and I have an athletic build, not fat, he's 5'9 normal/small frame) and that he has always been with very skinny petite girls (lots of comparison with his ex). we discussed a bit, I was annoyed but said that if it was his preference  I couldn't do anything but he should have communicated it to me before instead of making nasty subtle comments.  
The next day he apologizes profusely, saying that he let his mind get the best of him, that I'm attractive, and a lot of other bs. So another month passes by with him pretending to like me.  
We meet, and he gets physical immediately (so i think he likes me), I let it play out but it's all extremely rough (besides doing something non-consensual). I could feel a very weird energy and I communicated it to him. After a lot of bullshitting, 3 days after he finally admits what's the truth.  
He doesn't find me attractive. He also criticizes my life, my house, my car, my bedsheets, and the fact that I watch Youtube. EVERYTHING. He tells me that I have a lot of darkness inside me and more. that he should have listened to his gut feeling and not come. ah he also used the things i told him about my past against me. (the bad experiences I had)
He knew what I think about casual sex (i had been celibate for 1 year and I don't have sex unless there is an emotional connection). but he said that he wanted to see if the sexual chemistry could have dissipated what he felt inside.  
If u don't find someone attractive what kind of sexual chemistry u can have????????  


MAKE IT MAKE SENSE

funny part is, he's a small crooked D, has no career, little money, and has been living in his car for the past  6 months but somehow feels like a catch and that he can throw shit at everything I have and I am.

175,Not mathematically possible,"There are frequently posts and comments on this forum indicating that the vast majority of women are chasing the top minority of men. I've heard this from male friends IRL as well. There is also a theme that a young man must basically perfect himself (gym, career, therapy) before he will ""win"" a woman as a mate. I just read a post from a 21-year-old male asking if he should improve himself for the rest of the decade and date in his 30s. 9 years of self improvement to be good enough to date???? You can earn a law or medical degree in less than 9 years. Do we really think the average man attracting an average woman requires more dedicated effort than a graduate degree?

The math for these concepts doesn't add up. According to a random CDC publication I googled out of curiosity, the probability that men will marry by age 40 is 81% compared to an 86% probability for women. So, while women do marry at a higher rate, the difference is slight. The vast majority of both sexes will, in fact, find a marriage partner by age 40. Even more may not legally marry but enter satisfying romantic unions during that time.

So it just isn't possible that four our of five men are perpetually overlooked. If that were true, who are these women marrying? Doesn't it seem much more likely that this is the perception because the majority of single men are also chasing the top tier of available women? Perhaps because those are the women you notice on IG and out at the clubs? I often wonder if men sort of don't notice less traditionally attractive women, don't show interest in them, and then complain that ""no"" women will have them.

At some point before age 40, about 75% of both sexes have married, so isn't the most likely reality that both sexes are chasing partners who are ""out of their league"" at roughly the same rate? If not, how do you explain how they eventually seem to level off and pair up about the same rate? It's not like the top fifth of men are serial-marrying all of the women.

If dating is nearly impossible for men because women have such high standards, how does it eventually all work out more or less evenly?",dating

Im always up to do something interesting and fun, most recently went white water rafting with freinds one weekend and then driving range the other.

I have pretty good success online dating as far as getting matches/dates. After taking a break from dating for 6 months I re-downloaded hinge last month and have about 70 matches. Out of them I have gone on dates with about 10.

I look for someone as an equal to me, as I am looking for something serious. So all have at least college degrees and most have a graduate degree or are working on it (Engineer, Nurse, Doctor ect).

The issue becomes is that I find most of these women dont have many passions/hobbies outside of their careers. When I ever I ask what do you do for fun question I always get the same answer of - Hang with friends, Shop, watch netflix ect. It becomes hard to hold any conversation of substance with them. I feel this has been a common problem with me for the past 2 years or so I have been dating, there really has only ever been 2-3 women that actually were interesting to me.

I know myself for one, if I had a good woman who stood next to me in my battles I would have already been A LOT further in life.

Not to mention my bond and respect for a girlfriend would be even stronger knowing they met and stood by me when I was at the bottom..

Sure some men can do it all alone but not everyone is wired to go it totally alone and succeed

EDIT; To be clear these shouldn't be the people you have to go outta your way or drain all your own resources for but simply being you inspires them to be a better person.

187,I don't like flirting or trying to be friends with girls.,"I don't know I just feel like flirting is a waste of time.

I am very intimate and a hopeless romantic and unless I REALLY like you I just don't feel comfortable/like wasting my time and emotions for a stranger I don't even like that much outside of their looks and that they are a girl. Which also makes it hard to even be friends with girls because I don't like approaching them if they are flooded with vultures and simps of men because I don't want to compete for her attention JUST TO BE A FRIEND.

I feel like this is fucking up my reach to ever finding my soulmate though. But I don't like being fake.

I hate it.

Also OLD sucks ass as many of us agree. Where I live it's hard to find any girl I even might be interested in, and when I am  , they are either swarmed with simps or taken, or well reject me.

I forgot reddit is full of fucking idiots.

Just gonna put this here for people who aren't understanding.

There is always a competitiveness to even trying to be friends with them, and I'm venting that I don't like the fact that I have to basically work harder for a strangers attention , simply because everyone is trying to fuck them. I wish I could just be myself and chill, but no Im not as funny or good looking as the other guys, so I have to put on a show. I hate that.

188,Physical fitness,"Physical fitness is something I (27M) take seriously and expect a potential partner to do the same. I see overweight and obese women all over these dating apps complaining guys are immature and don’t like them because of their bodies and say stuff like “swipe left if you don’t like BBWs or plus size.” Most high value guys don’t like that. Do something about it if you’re not satisfied or not having success.

Many women in dating apps would be much more appealing to more guys if they got down to a healthy weight. The truth is that looks are the primary thing most guys are looking for. A lot of exercise isn’t even required to get a physique most men would prefer; it’s almost all about calorie intake and diet. So many people do not want to do the work though and will forever be stuck in their ways. This can be applied to overweight men too. Most women don’t want to date fat guys. I’ve had much more success after taking responsibility for my health and appearance.",dating
189,I've been seeing a lot of complaining and sexism,"There are a lot of bitter men out here on this sub reddit mad and bitter about women getting a lot of matches and themselves not getting any at all. My advice for you as a fellow cis male. LEARN TO MOVE ON. Rejection happens to everyone and even if you didn't get rejected and that person you think is hot is really a piece of shit what's the point of matching or being accepted by them??? Not every woman is a cuddly warm teddy bear.... they're human and have flaws too just like men...

Lastly learn to be confident and courageous and intelligent with your approach to women that's really all they're asking for. Just don't be a piece of shit, be kind (not nice because that's fake) and accept them within reason that's it",dating
190,I'm sick of women using me for my height.,"It's always the same experience with women on dating apps. ""OMG you're 6 ft 4, you're so TALL 😍😍"".

And legit they want to show me off to their friends and family like I'm some kind of trophy. I've honestly had it with this sort of behavior. As good as it may seem, everything seems so superficial. I'm a human being, I'm not a meter stick. 

I'm just not going to tell women my height anymore. You either go out on a date with me and get to know me or you don't. It's your call. I'm not gonna sit there and have you fawn over my height and let you fetishize me for your pleasure.

191,It’s hard out there for a trans woman,"Heya! My name is Lily. 33. Trans woman. I use she/her pronouns.

I have been on dating apps since I’ve started transitioning and I’ve found it very difficult. 

Avoiding death threats, especially the really creepy local ones that hit hard.

Dodging chasers who just want to talk to you because they want to try what they saw in the very realistic porn videos that they secretly watch. 

Finding hope in the kind messages of a person who then tells you they messaged you because they knew you wouldn’t judge them because they wear adult diapers out of choice.

I’ve had sprinkles of luck, but it’s really difficult. And I wanted to shed some light on the subject.

192,"I’m attracted to this guy, but he said he needs to “think about” whether he can take me on a date or not, is this a red flag?","So, he works with my brother and the last time he saw me (at my brothers 21st), I had a boyfriend. This was around a month ago…what he doesn’t know is, I had broken up with that boyfriend a few days before and he showed up to the party anyway. I didn’t want to cause a scene so I just let him stay and didn’t talk to him. 

I made it clear that I found my brothers friend attractive and tried to very briefly explain the boyfriend situation, but we had all had a lot to drink and I’m not sure he completely understood. Nevertheless, he followed me on Instagram and started liking all my stories / photos. 

Now, to paint the picture…I’d say I’m above average on the attractiveness scale. I’ve never really had any trouble physically attracting men. My friends have often said that the only men who wouldn’t find me attractive would have to be gay haha. The guy that I’m interested in is more of a unique type of attractive, I don’t think many girls would be flocking at him so don’t really think he needs to play hard to get. Realistically, I know under normal circumstances he would probably want to take me on a date if I suggested it…problem is, I’ve asked him to take me out and his response - “I’m playing it safe, appreciate that I’m a good bloke. I’ll think about it and get back to you xx” 

Can a male decipher this for me?! He is giving really mixed signals and honestly, the chase is making him way more desirable in my mind.",dating

She has good morals, and I know she is a great person. Her political party does not affect her as a person, in my opinion. Although I don’t agree, I am okay with her being unvaccinated. A lot of it has to do with her parents anyways. However, my parents and extended family are crazy liberals and pro-vaccination. They have even told me to stay away from unvaccinated people as they could give me Covid (im high risk). Im scared to tell them she’s a conservative and unvaccinated. I know they will be disappointed and have something against her. However, I obviously don’t want to lie to them. Any tips? Thanks!",dating
195,Is dating now just for tall beautiful white men and the women who want to pump and dump with them?,"The only guys who post on here saying they're successful in dating seem to always be some combo of tall, white, and beautiful. It seems that never goes out of fashion for women.

Every guy I know IRL or that I see only who isn't those things is talking about how they can't even get any dates at all.

It seems the only people who are having fun are those guys and the women who want to get pumped and dumped with them or be their ""FWB.""

What do you think? Is dating close to dead for us men who don't fulfill the Hitl3r fantasy?

I even saw a post yesterday from a good looking tall buff black guy who shared his photos (which all looked great). He said he couldn't get any matches or dates either. If I knew him IRL, I would have thought a guy like that would have zero problems and have lots of women want him. Yet here he was also posting on here about how he can't get any matches and all his dating apps are dead.

It seems things have gotten worse than I imagined. I know most women have never wanted brown or yellow men except as friends, but I thought tall fit black guys would still be fashionable enough.

I was disgusted at him talking about our body shapes and curves like that. Recently I mentioned this to a friend and he didn't see anything wrong in this. He said men only care about physical appearance and sex appeal. Also, they prefer a subservient girl who earns less and is dependent on them.

198,Why do people have such a problem with being ghosted?,"I think being ghosted is awesome and the best way to break up with someone. It is not like you spend hours chatting and texting back and forth to get to know someone only to suddenly be blocked on iPhone and Facebook with no warning. Suddenly unmatched on Bumble and Tinder. Maybe your calls text messages go into the either? Who knows? because they get no response when you send them. Those tickets for two you got to the movie, I am sure or that you can just return those. That RSVP you made at that four-star restaurant. I am sure they will understand when you call to cancel when someone else could have taken that table. It is not like you had visions of spending the rest of your life with this person you thought had the same feelings you did and if they didn't would just tell you and be upfront. It isn't like I could have done something productive that day instead of getting ready for that date that will never happen now.

It was so annoying that I immediately blocked him. It be amusing though. I'm just ranting, and I was curious if anyone else had encountered this and why people are the way they are.",dating
201,Women have it just as bad as men when it comes to dating,"I'm a guy, and I see a lot of other guys complain about how frustrated they are with the dating scene and how women have it better. While their frustrations are valid, I would argue that this idea or this mindset that women have it better is simply not true. The reality is that women have as much trouble as men in the dating scene and they complain about it just as much (take this sub for example), but they experience their difficulties in different ways.

Men usually have a difficult time securing a date, and this is what they often complain about. Which when you think about it, makes sense. In dating, women take most of the risk. They are more vulnerable to abuse because they're smaller and weaker. they can get pregnant, and they often get judged more harshly for dating choices. It's a lot to consider and the consequences of making the wrong choice can be scary. Therefore, it is in their best interest to vet again and again and again before going out with guys to minimize the risk. For guys, it's a numbers game. It is in our best interest to ask out as many girls as possible to increase the chances of finding a girl that deems us worthy. However, for many guys, their underwhelming results often leads to self-doubt, insecurity, frustration, and sometimes just giving up.

Women, on the other hand, usually have a difficult time securing a relationship, and this what they complain about. Again, it makes sense if you think about it. Women get flooded with requests for dates online and in real life, and this often leads to choice overload. When faced with too many choices, there will always be this fear that you may have made the wrong decision or that you might've missed on something better. Women in this position often become indecisive, frustrated, and dissatisfied with any of their choices. Another consequence of having too many choices is that it leads women to nitpick and make decisions over arbitrary things. This comes at the cost of vetting properly, which in turn increases the chances of them ending up dating a guy who's less than satisfactory or a guy has the same problem as them where they also have too many choices. This all can be overwhelming to deal with, and some women choose not to deal with it at all.

One could say that men and women have the same issues in dating and meeting people, just on different ends of it. Even though there are as many men as there are women, the dynamics of the dating scene don't make any sense. The current playing field is rigged and everybody loses. I'm not sure what the right solution is, but I think trying to understand the perspective of others helps at least a little.",dating
202,Who pays for dates?,"This is perhaps the most commonly asked question every guy has!

Some guys says ‘man always pays’, some guys say ‘it should be 50-50’, some guys say higher income earner should pay etc.

In my view, I practise the following:

1. First date gentleman always pays
2. Second date okay to go 50-50 but as a man try to pay the bill. Nothing wrong with footing the bill. 
3. Consistently Dating/Hooking up - Gentleman pays 70% of the time. The woman needs to contribute to the experience too.
4. Marriage/Living together - Go 50/50 on all bills unless the man is the higher income earner.

204,Dating as a queer women,"Dating women is fucking shit. I used to date men years ago and it was so much easier. Women are such hard work. I am lucky in a way because I live in london so there should be a lot of queer women to choose from. But I’ve been single for 5 years now. I think part of my problem is I’m used to dating very good looking girls and all my friends are straight so I’m never around queer women in my day to day. So this leaves me with apps. 

There is no decent apps for women who just want women, there’s no such thing as Grindr for girls. If you want to find meaningless sex it’s so difficult. in your 20s most people I come across are just figuring out they like girls and I’m often their first sexual experience. Things can get quite emotionally intense quite quickly - I’ve experienced this on my side and the other persons. 

Up until now I’ve kind of dated people consistently for the last 4 years but since February I literally can’t. Idk what is going on, I can’t find anyone I want to date. I think I’m just really over so many years of these apps and Ive got quite picky with who I’m attracted to. The most recent girl I dated I actually caught feelings for but knew from when I first met her it wasn’t going to work out. She was toxic and immature and behaved in ways that really hurt me. Buit took me 6 months before I fully cut it off and that’s because it was the closest thing I have had in so long to love.

It so shit because I feel like I really want to love someone, my life feels very empty at this point. I think for me being around another queer women helps me feel understood where I’m surrounded by straight people who I feel very different from. I have a lot of different interests to my friends and I’d say 75% of my nights out and gigs and stuff I go to alone, so i miss having someone to take with me. I’m also a very sexual person so I’m struggling with that side of things aswell and engaging in things that aren’t making me happy- like sleeping with men out of desperation 😭

I’m hopeful that I will meet someone at some point but I just look at my future and I see myself getting old and lonely. In someways I’m so jealous of my straight friends, everywhere we go and everyone we meet is a potential opportunity to meet the right guy. but for me it feels so difficult :(",dating
205,Why do women seem to go for obnoxious guys?,"So I (33m) had a bad day and decided to go out to a bar. The bar is empty, apart from one pretty bar maid called Angie(26f) I sat down and started ordering drinks and we started talking. We had a really long conversation which honestly meant a lot to me. As I was about to ask for her number in walks in around 6 guys, all early 20s. One half black guy, and 5 white guys with the half black guy the obvious ring leader/“alpha”. The main guy marches right up to the bar and asks for a “slut juice” (which I learned is apparently a double vodka with lemonade and lime). They all individually order the same drink and a few of them go off to the pool table and start playing pool. 

The “ringleader” stays at the bar talking to angie. He asks her to change the music, and she tells them to use the jukebox. The guy says he doesn’t wanna pay, and says he knows she has an aux in the back. She says she’ll get in trouble and the guy says “not even for me?” and to my surprise she goes and puts his phone on the aux in the back. After this they carry on talking and he asks her what her favourite drink is. She tells him sex on the beach and he laughs and tells her that’s a super “basic” drink. She tells him that slut juice is much more basic to which he responds “you know you love a good slut”. I thought this was really crude but she seemed to find it hilarious.

As time goes on the main guy continues to be super obnoxious, telling his friends how trash they are at pool, asking angie to give him ciggarettes (which for some reason she continually does) and stuff like that. Eventually angie asks if he wants to leave a positive review on tripadviser as if he mentions her by name she gets a bonus. He says “I would if you were actually good at your job”. She feins offense and says “I’m good at everything I’ll have you know”. The guy crudely replies “I bet you are” which gets a bunch of cheers from his lackeys. She laughs and says “I didn’t mean it like that but you’re not wrong”. He says “we’ll have to see about that” and she replies “if you’re lucky”. At this point I’m dumbfounded how this sweet, pretty, intelligent young woman is playing into his bullshit.

As time goes on it hits 10:30pm and starts raining, and 3 of the lackeys leave, leaving just the 5 of us in the bar. The ring leader complains about how he doesn’t want to walk to the club in the rain and asks angie if she would drive him and his friends. She agrees but says she won’t get out until half 11 unless people leave sooner. The guy turns to me and starts pressuring me to leave and angie just doesn’t say anything. He starts turning off the speakers and gambling machines and rushing angie to shut the bar and she actually does. He starts barking orders at his lackeys to stack the chairs while angie counts up the till and then she comes from round the bar links arms with the guy, kisses him on the cheek and says “thanks for helping me close”. He asks if she’s gonna party with them and she says “well I could come for a few drinks” and they pile into her car and drive off.

As I walk home drunk in the rain I just feel rage and then despair. Why do women go for guys like that? Crude, obnoxious, assholes with huge egos? Me and her had a deep meaningful conversation and then in walks in some typical “alpha male” and I become invisible. What is it about guys like that that makes seemingly smart, nice women go crazy?",dating
206,Is it normal to seek women only for the sex?,"So I used to be a person sho would love just the personality side, but as I grow older, I keep thinking that maybe, since sex is overall healthy, I shouldnt keep it our of my dictionary, and also I began to believe that relationships are stupid and time-wasting anyway… This made me believe that sex is the only useful thing to see in relationships, but I am open to new insights, I can be wrong.",dating

I believed her until I found out she was spending most of her time with the last guy she was seeing. She didn’t know I know. I would see her be inactive on facebook for hours and I thought it was because she was studying but it was weird because she would text me or be on her phone while studying. He got the full of experience of her. I only got to see her once a month for dinner and only had sex with her once. She still calls me with the same story about busy. I also made a hinge profile pretending to be a  attractive men and I was receiving messages from very attractive women that the regular men would think this women is barely on the app. With aggressive messages going for what they want.

209,I love him to pieces but he doesn’t turn me on.,"This will be relatively long one but stick with me, I’d really love some advice…

I'm 27 and I’ve been dating a guy for 6 months. He’s amazing, he treats me amazingly, we have soooo much fun together, are so comfortable with one another… I genuinely couldn’t find a bad thing to say about him.The only thing is that our physical relationship isn’t great. For me anyway. 

He is an attractive guy. He makes me feel beautiful, and when we first started dating the sex was fine. I am a hugely sexual person and always have been. Probably one of my problems is most of my past relationships has always been based on sex. The type of relationship where we can’t keep our hands off each other, out of this world kind of sex… but they have never worked out because that’s all it was.

Now I have met someone who is perfect, but he can't turn me on. If we do have sex, I do it to get it over with. I know I could speak to him about it. I also know that he isn’t as sexually experienced as I am. Personally, for me, sexual attraction is either there or it isn’t. I don’t want to be someone’s mentor.

Friends advice is not to throw something away that feels so right just because the sex isn’t great. That attraction dies eventually, and growing old with someone you love and can be happy with is more important.

I don't want to end things over it because we have so many other wonderful aspects to our relationship, but it's something I want and need in a relationship. 

I am so upset about it. What should I do?",dating
210,Why it is racist to “prefer to date only someone of your race”,"I keep seeing these threads having the crap upvoted out of them because the internet loves an excuse for racism, so just for fun and because why not, here are 10 reasons “preferring to date someone only of your race” is racist. (This is from my experience) (as an ambiguously brown person) 

1. Because you said it. You stood there in a group of people, when nobody on earth asked you, and said “I only date WHITE GIRLS” and then stared me down. Hey you know what? I didn’t ask you out. I have no interest. But the fact that you turned this into an exclusion party is racist. 

2. Because you don’t even know what “your race” is. “I only date Asian girls” Your name is Johnny and you’re an American from Jersey. Stop. 

3. Because you’re describing features, not race or culture. You like Asian girls? My friend Chandrika from India is single. Oh, not THAT kind of Asian? You like African girls? How cool, this is Starsha, from Egypt! Oh, not THAT kind of African. 

4. You have no understanding of the race or culture you “prefer”. Thanks for the offer to date me because we both love weed and Cardi B, and thanks so much for asking if I actually love any of those things instead of assuming, based on skin tone. 

5. You sexualize a race, and lump someone in with it. No, I do not know any of the positions of the Kamasutra. No, I am not asking to marry you. No, I did not take off my hijab and sully my family’s honour. 

6. You’ll make an exception for sex…but you won’t bring me home. YOU’RE not racist, it’s your parents. You would totally want a long term relationship if THEY weren’t forcing you to date someone from your small island nation of 8,000 people….and find her in Canada. 

7. You will date outside of your race, but you will use this leverage to make racist jokes and comments, put down and disparage your partner…or worse, your kids. “My kid has ADHD because she’s black” -authentic quote. Or their features “omgeee I just don’t know what to do with her hayyyyaaarrr” 

8. You’ll break up with people who have the right features if they turn out not to be the “right race”. “I found out she was actually Portuguese and I just couldn’t be with her after that” “He spoke Japanese but he was actually Chinese” 

9. You think I’m beautiful but “it’s like looking at a pretty alien.” -direct quote

10. You and your friends build up the confidence and perceived worth of a specific race of people regardless of their actual looks. You stand around in a crowd screaming that any guy who dated me would be an outcast and a loser. That impacts who others choose to date and anyone who does date me is socially ostracized until he properly dates a white girl. You post entire threads online about it and call it a racial preference. 

TL;DR if you had an actual preference, you wouldn’t have to announce it and police others with it.

Edit: I will not respond to people who clearly didn’t read a word I wrote but super want to be racist.",dating
211,Why are girls so picky with who they date?,"Guys need to be at least 6ft tall, 6 inches, 6 figure salary, 6 pack abs, good face while girls just need to be at a healthy weight and lots of guys will line up to date her.",dating
212,"As a man who will be entering his 30's very soon, is it wrong of me to go for younger, more attractive girls in their early to mid 20's?","So I will be 30 in a few months, and honestly I have not really dated much throughout my 20's. I have been focused mainly on myself, working on my career, fitness, hobbies, etc. I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like mentally I am able to handle all of my own responsibilities rather easily, so I am wanting to get out there and take dating more seriously.

Ultimately I would like to get married and have a family one day. Also, since I have taken good care of my health, fitness, and finances, I am definitely currently the most attractive I have ever been in my life (much more attractive than when I was in my early 20's).

So just thinking about this logically, why wouldn't I try to date women you are younger, and to put it bluntly, more attractive? Especially since I want kids one day, so dating someone my age would mean that we would only have a few short years before she starts approaching her 40's and the risk of birth complications starts going up.

Is there anything wrong with going for younger girls? Any other guys in a similar situation?  I actually posted this in dating advice, and got some pushback so I'd like to hear some other opinions.",dating
213,Celibacy Before Marriage?,"Would you be open to practicing celibacy with someone you could see yourself marrying up until the night you exchange vows?

I have been celibate by choice since July 2022 and he has been since November. We have discussed our intentions with one another and after watching a sermon online recently, I asked him if he would be celibate up until the night we marry. After going into a deep discussion, he expressed the fact that yes it would be challenging but he would continue being celibate until then. 

This made me feel really good because it helps us focus on our relationship with God as well as one another. Granted this is something fairly new, it is a sacrifice we both are willing to take.

People always give me this same dating advice BULLSHIT of ""get your shit together, and then you'll find someone"". That's a huge pile of crap for a number of reasons.

In my case, it's getting my degree. Well, then what? I'll be working on my master's, and then people will give me the advice of, ""work on yourself, wait until you're done with your master's degree, then you can settle down"". Then what? Then ""working on myself"" will consist of saving up enough money for a house. Once I do that and have more free time, people will tell me to work on my hobbies and get some new interests. Then, it will be to get the next promotion at work. Then, it will be some other arbitrary thing.

There is NO POINT at which someone ""has their shit together"". My late best friend was a CPK host with aspirations to be a forklift operator, and he was with the love of his life. On the other hand, ELON MUSK, who ""has his shit together"" and has ""worked on himself"", has had a lot of trouble when it comes to women.

216,I finally decided I’m interested in him and now he’s acting dry,"I (F24) have known this guy (M26) since college. I’ve never really thought much of him tbh, I was even in a brief relationship with one of his friends back in the day. He didn’t really start showing interest in me until a couple of years ago. He would DM me a lot, asked me out on a couple of dates, and I just didn’t really reciprocate the energy. I don’t know what happened, but recently I changed my mind about him and we’ve been talking pretty much every single day for the past few weeks. I was still a bit unsure, but I’ve decided over the past couple of days that I really do like him. Of course, now that I’ve come to that conclusion, he’s been so distant. He doesn’t message me first and when I do message him, he replies with one word answers. I just find it so strange that he’s spent 2 years relentlessly pursuing me and now that I’m into it he’s pulled back. What do you think this means? What should I do?

Edit because everyone is making the assumption that I only started pursuing him after he stopped pursuing me: 
The timing simply wasn’t right when he was pursuing me at the start. I had just gotten out of a relationship. Even so, I kept a platonic relationship with him. Everyone here seems to think I only became interested once he stopped pursuing me. This is not the case. We were both actively pursuing each other, and he only started growing distant after a few weeks of us non-stop communicating. It’s clear to me that the general consensus is that he’s no longer interested, I just didn’t expect so many people would be angry that I didn’t try to force something that wasn’t there in the beginning.

218,"As a man, men need to learn to date in their league, not complain so much, and not take stuff personally","I'm saying all of this as a guy whose dating life has improved extraordinarily in the past year and who feels like I'm finally understanding dating a lot more. And wish that someone had given me this advice at a time when I was feeling much more insecure and self-loathing when I should have been a lot more easy on myself and a lot less naively optimistic about dating.

The reality is as a guy, if you are not handsome, tall, socially confident and a healthy weight (and I mean all four), dating is TOUGH. If you're tall and decent-looking, but painfully shy and awkward, it's tough. If you're outgoing and funny, but a bit on the short side or pudgy, it's tough. And if you lack all four, it's even tougher. And don't give me examples of some short or overweight or shy guy who ""kills it"" with the ladies-we're either talking about someone who's famous or rich, dating someone they've known for ages, or a considerable anomaly. Guys make it a lot harder on themselves when they don't accept LEAGUES EXIST. Leagues exist and they are about looks, weight, height, and charisma and nothing else. It is not about how smart you are or how funny you are or how good a person you are. That shit is valuable if you want be a good friend or successful comedian or get into Harvard. But it's not relevant to dating. Hell, it's relevant once you're actually in a relationship or marriage, but to the game of dating we're all subjected, nah.

What guys do is pretend leagues don't exist, or I don't ""belive in leagues"", or whatever, and then throw a tantrum when they get rejected by every one they make a move on. The same way class and institutional racism exists, that whether you like it nor it's easier for a white person or a man to get a top salaried job than a black person or a woman, your looks and confidence define where you're at in terms of dating and you've gotta be realistic.

The problem is, men take accepting their league as being somehow a way of saying they're ugly or they're not popular, etc. That if they decide to not hit on every 9 and 10 they see on Tinder they must not be worth dating.

The reality is: no! You, dude, are 100% a catch for someone, but you're a catch for someone in your league. And I'll hear guys moan, but I have handsome face or I'm tall or I'm funny, etc. But are you tall, handsome, skinny, and confident, and all four? If not, then dude, you're not an 8-10, you're a 5-7. And as a guy, if you're a 5-7, you're not going to realistically do better than that in the girl department. Why should a girl have to put up with something you're not willing to accept in the opposite sex? Too many guys are passing up totally adorable, cute girls who are not the perfect weight or have the perfect face cause of entitlement.

And what I'll say, as someone who has dated outside of my league in the past, it's overrated as hell. You spend all the time feeling totally uncomfortable cause you're aware of the situation and know that person could be dating someone who's more of a hottie. Normal looking girls are just as sexy and fun in bed and romantic as the super hot girls, and they tend to be a lot more down to earth. Once you accept that leagues are real, you stop taking your lack of success personally and start realizing the game...that yeah, I am a catch, but not by these stupid social measurements. And then you start dating people in your league and suddenly you have people just as interested in you as you are into them.

Losing weight and going for girls in my league exclusively is the smartest thing I've ever done. I'm not saying dating becomes easy. Being single can be hard enough because of not having someone to have a loving relationship or sex with. There's no reason to throw insecurity into the mix and take it personally. The 80-90% of guys who find dating nowadays tough need to realize it's not them, it's just the reality for the other 80-90%. And that they'll eventually find someone if they're persistent, take care of their appearance/weight, get the best possible pics for their dating app profiles, and stick to their league. There's def a girl who wants to date you. It just might not be the one who you're making a tantrum about.

It's not about convicing yourself you're a higher league than you are-it's about liking yourself and your appearance at the league you are. Instead of being a 5 or a 7 and convcing yourself you're a 9 and no one knows it (least of all women), be the hottest, most confident 5 or 7 you can be.

My main point is you want someone as into you as you are into them, not just the hottest person you can find, and you're deluding yourself if you don't accept the primacy of looks in this. ",dating

They also say that short guys aren't manly and we end up automatically having some napoleon complex, really? Like its as if a short guy they encounter is automatically seen as insecure and have some kind of complex. A lot of these women also make this dumb argument that we seem to be entitled to short women or act as if they belong to us, but they don't realize that they're usually the ones that are a good amount shorter than a lot of us without realize the shit that we go through while playing it out as if we're acting ""entitled.""",dating
222,Do women vastly prefer foreign men over their own men?,"Can somebody explain this phenomena to me? At least in my own experience, women from my home country are 100% disinterested in dating me.

Well, there was the one time I went to the US and had American girls pining over me. Then in Thailand, 1000 of matches with girls willing to date me and go out with me. The same thing in Colombia, Germany, etc, basically: any country outside my own.

I often hear American men say: Man, our women are so unfeminine, they hate us, blah blah. In my experience, the American girls I met were super feminine, nice, kind and fun to be around! But what they say about their girls is the same thing I can say about girls from my country.

The first three dates were fantastic-great chemistry, we made out and he said he wanted to see if 'us' can be a thing (relationship-wise). He also told me he would like to take intimacy slowly so that we don't kill the spark. However, the last two weeks he has cancelled the dates on Sunday night twice. First time, he said he double-booked and needed to reschedule the date. This time, he told me he was not feeling well the whole week, did't work at the hospital, and will have to postpone it to next Sunday. Although both times he offered a time to meet up again, I got a bit annoyed and texted him that I rather him to be honest and not wasting my time. He texted back and said he's keen to see me and he doesn't like to play stupid games...the reason why I have been suspicious is because we met on a dating app and a few day",dating

226,Why my boyfriend wouldn’t help me when I need his help?,"Hi guys, Me (25 f) and my bf (24 m) had some arguments today. And I am wondering whose fault it is.😵‍💫
So today my house’s water was shut off, and told my bf at 5pm and he said he could offer me shower. However, I had some vision appointments with my colleague after work so I didn’t check my phone, and after I finished vision check and dinner with my colleague, it was already 8:30pm.
Then I called my bf, he said he was about to shower so we hanged up.
At 9:10pm when I got home, there’s still no water at home. So I asked him if I can go to his place and stay over. He said no because he normally goes to sleep at 10pm.
I was upset because all I asked was one easy help only for one really inconvenient night, but he said no because he couldn’t delay one hour sleep for just one day.
But his point was he offered me about shower and stuff awhile ago, and I didn’t respond. When I called him for help, it was already late for him as he needs to go to sleep at 10pm.

Am I asking too much? Whose fault is it? What do you guys think?





Edit:
Thanks guys for all of your response and opinions 🙏🏼. Really appreciate it!

Some more context: 
1) I planned my vision appointment with my colleague (also my manager) last week, so I thought I shouldn’t dropped the appointment because of today’s water off accident. I checked my phone once during the dinner but my colleague was talking to me, so I thought I’d reply back to my bf later.
2) I got the water shut off notice around 3pm, I texted my bf around 5pm. I wasn’t sure if I should go to his place as I wasn’t sure if the water would come back, so I didn’t make plans with him in advance.  After I got home 9:10pm, I realized I still didn’t have water at home, so I tried to call him asap to see if he could help.
3) It was not just about the shower, I told him no water on toilets, sinks, etc… so I couldn’t use toilet or wash my face/hands or brush my teeth. He said the water shall be back in the morning and refused me.
4) After seeing you guys’ comments, I realized I should have made plans in advance and not wait till the last minute, as he might not always be available for me.  But I am upset bc after realizing how inconvenient I am tonight, why couldn’t he just compromise for 1 night? Like it’s just 1 hour later’s sleep… 
5) thanks for y’all’s  opinions, made me realize part of my bad as well",dating

233,How to hack online dating process. For men.,"I know that the online dating scene is ridiculously biased.  Women get a flood of messages and guys don't get enough messages, or spend ages just texting without meeting up. I get it, that its a pain also for the women to wade through 100s if not 1000s of messages.

I am someone who does a lot better in person so I am keen to meet someone face to face as soon as possible. Once the initial meeting has happened then by all means maintain contact via messages.

However the challenge is to not spend soo much time online.  So, I have decided to outsource this part of the process.  I have hired a female assistant, given her my login details and all she has to do is to text message and maintain contact with the women that I say I like. The aim being to get them comfortable enough to want to meet up in person.  In some cases the women may want a phone conversation before hand. That would also be fine. They arrange the call and I take the call.

Lets see how this works out for me.

Now I know that the women here are going to absolutely hate this.  They will feel  this I am leading the women on and that they are perhaps being reverse catfished, if there is such a thing.

Sorry ladies but the odds are just so stacked against us men (and you also have a difficult job to sift through all the flood of messages). All I am doing is trying to even out the odds in my favour a bit.

This is just about getting the face to face dates, nothing more than that. It is still up to me in person to develop chemistry with the people I meet.",dating

I’d really appreciate the help as I am starting to be afraid of men and dating in general.

I (25F) have come to a realization that all of my life, I have always picked older men who seem kind and have everything together, but only to find out they are horrible people. 

I’m pretty independent and financially stable myself, but I also want a man who I know will have my back, who’s considerate, and can take care/protect me if life decides to beat me to a pulp one day. It’s not really much to ask right? 

Welp…. from dating a 30 year old man who I basically had to mother at the age of 21. A man who I had the horror of finding out that he didn’t wash his bedsheets for 3 years until he met me, who I had to ask him if he would pay half of the Plan B that I, as a broke college student at the time, couldn’t afford. Not to mention he made me venmo him back the bag of chips that I got at the store that he paid for bc I forgot my wallet. He made roughly 75k/yr at the time and lives at home with his parents, can’t the man just let me have my bag of Cheetos? My goodness

Anywho, from that 30 yr old man-child, I moved on to a 29 yr old who came off as kind and caring for the first couple months, I mean the man washes his bedsheets alright, and you might think it’s funny bc it’s the bare minimum, but please try to understand that it is incredibly hard nowadays to find men with those bare minimums. With this man, I really thought I met the one, only to find out that he is a complete narc. He conceal-carries  everywhere we go (Costco, the gym, his mom’s, and on all of our dates), would get mad that I don’t give him enough of my time  or attention. No matter what I do to appease him, it is never enough. But what really got me was when he told me he wanted to take me to LA for Valentine’s Day, only to come back home and sent me a spreadsheet of all the expenses, asking for half, which is perfectly fine with me, but the cherry on top was when I saw that he charged me $2.50 for a water bottle that I thought he bought for me out of care. There’s more to this but I don’t need to go further more into detail for you to get the kind of man he is. 

Please be nice as I don’t date a lot and really struggle with filtering out these toxic men. They are everywhere. I don’t hate men as my dad and grandpa are wonderful husbands to their wives. I know there are great men out there, but how do I know if they are genuinely good and not putting up a fake nice guy facade?",dating

238,"""Modern dating sucks"", ""I hate hookup culture"", ""Online dating is trash"".....","This seems to be the overwhelming narrative on this sub. But can I get a high five from people who actually enjoy dating in today's world?

Can we talk about how liberating modern dating is? Can we talk about how online dating has helped widen our options? About how it helps us explore and find ourselves, our preferences, without any societal pressure whatsoever.

For example, if there was no online dating, I would have been stuck with my tiny social circle. Would have been around the same 10-12 people all my life. For someone who's always busy with work, this is an absolute game changer. I have made connections with people from all walks of life, be it sexual, romantic or platonic. I've had experiences, some mediocre some life changing, which my introverted self of 5 years ago would have never dreamt of. My personality has also grown by leaps and bounds on account of those experiences.

It seems to me most of people's complains about modern dating comes from being unclear about their intentions, expectations, and boundaries. Treating every date on its own, thinking of it as an opportunity to meet people you wouldn't usually meet in real life, is far more rewarding; than going into it expecting to meet the love of your life.

247,Just a quick PSA since I see so many angry threads: HAVE ZERO EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE....,"No matter what stage of ""dating"" you're at. Quite literally, you could be in a relationship, a MARRIAGE, hooking up, just matched on the app, talking for a day, talking for a week, an hour a year: ALWAYS assume that person could fall out of love and interest for you. At any stage of your interaction with them.

The reason so many people have so much pain is because so many of us have not caught up to the reality of the fickle age we live in now, of social media, dating apps etc. If you make peace with the fact that you could wake up tomorrow after having had amazing sex with someone, an amazing time, been promised a relationship, or promised a date, a girl who had enthusiasm for you but then ghosted etc, you will literally never have to make another Reddit thread complaining about these assorted issues that ultimately communicate the same message ""LEAVE ME ALONE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING WITH YOU IN ANY CAPACITY"".

TLDR: Just block and delete numbers, matches, people who don't reciprocate interest.

There are sooooo many other things to ask than a HEY HOW R U 🙄

What do you expect the reply to be... we are under lockdown... everyone is socially distancing and staying at home... what kind of response would you expect that  insinuates an ongoing convo?

Then I see certain requirements like - must be able to make tacos, don’t take things too seriously, no pineapple on pizza, must lift... do these things even really matter??

2. I'm a skinny guy. I want to date a skinny girl. Being overweight IS NOT HEALTHY and people need to stop thinking it's ok. Hell, even my friend who is fat as fuck said that too. He said knows being overweight is unhealthy and he is trying to lose weight. But it's not easy and I understand that but you can't get anywhere if you don't try.

I brought this up to the last girl I was GOING to date. I thought she would have looked good skinny. But then she started to say how I didn't love her for her. I said I did but being overweight is unhealthy. She tried to say her DOCTORS never said anything about her weight. I'm gonna call bullshit. I'm so sick of all these girls thinking they look pretty and cute when they way double me. I'm 155lbs at 5'5. Same height as Daniel Radcliffe.

 The conversation went that she was talking about the fact that she wanted to lose weight. I told her that I goto the gym. I would love for someone to go with me. I would even be willing to bump it up to 20 a month to have a 2nd person. At first she was happy and excited about it, then sometime that night, she got all upset at me saying ""you dont love me for who I am."" I explained to her that I am a man who enjoys running around, going places, as I see her always talking about Netflix, eating and staying in 1 spot. To her, this is a lot of work. I told her that I believed she could. I never once called her fat. She talked about getting lypo and gastro and I said if that's what she wants, do it. She flipped flopped on her emotions constantly when I talked to her. I really did see that she could better herself. I think everyone can but she doesn't seem to want to. ",dating

I try my god damn hardest to not whine (anymore) and yet, nothing.... I've had girlfriends, I've been around. I know what women like or at least I'm willing to learn.

255,Consistency is key!,"I matched with a guy on Thursday and we spent two hours messaging back and forth. We seemed to have a lot in common and the convo flowed easily. He asked if I’d like to grab a drink this weekend and I said I would be free Sat afternoon. He said great! I told him I had to go to bed, but we could chat more tomorrow. Friday morning I messaged him my cell # so we could switch to texting. I had a busy day in the office but figured he would text at some point. He didn’t, and he didn’t message back in the app. This morning I unmatched him. It makes zero sense to me that we could message a ton Thurs, be excited to meet and see if we have chemistry, and then do radio silence Fri. 

EVEN if he was super busy, he could have just told me that! 

“Hey, I enjoyed chatting with you last night and look forward to meeting you tomorrow. I’m swamped at work right now, so I’ll message you tomorrow morning and we can confirm where and when for drinks. Have a good day!”

That would have been perfectly fine! We’re all busy, we’ve all got plenty going on in our lives outside the dating apps. But you can’t expect the other person to know / understand what’s happening behind the scenes if you don’t communicate!

I know some guys will read this and think I jumped the gun in unmatching him. I bet he opened up the app this morning expecting to message me and make plans for this afternoon. But that’s not acceptable to me. And I hate to say it, but I have plenty of other options that I could meet for a drink too, so I don’t appreciate having my free time (or available time to meet for dates) wasted or not confirmed.",dating

But when you go on one date or 2 dates with someone and then your crying about being ghosted, you should realize that's just the norm in 2019 and most people who have healthy dating lives are not that devestated when they get ghosted because they don't invest all their emotional energy in one person.

When her skin was clearest, her social life was the most robust, she was in her best physical shape and when her youthful energy was at her peak, she wouldn’t have been caught dead with you 

So what? Don’t get caught up in that. Grow up. People mature. 

She’s in her 30s now. She’s more mature. Her worldview is different. Her priorities are different. Looks don’t matter as much now. Her height preferences have relaxed. Before you had to be 6’2+ to date her, now she just wants a man to be her height or taller. Her self esteem is higher. Before she would sleep with a man she just met. Now, she requires several high effort dates and impeccable charisma and commitment on the guys part before any physical contact is initiated. Her skin isn’t as clear, she has wrinkles and her body isn’t as fit as it used to be. So what? The stress from her work has consumed her. She has a great job, makes great money and is a total catch

260,Myth: Women have a hard time getting noticed on dating apps - BUSTED,"I made this as a reply comment on someone else’s post but I think it’s worth its own post.

Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I’m average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I’m a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I’ll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I’m not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I’d be interested in dating. I’m not saying I have 5,000+ “quality” men to choose from. (By “quality”, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I’m *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don’t for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it’s hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it’s hard to get attention from the *types of men she’s most interested in*. *That’s* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I’m not saying any woman deserves or *doesn’t* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you’re truly worth and there’s no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that “girls have a hard time dating”. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I’m too much of a dork and I’m too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don’t owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I’m lying.

No, I won’t give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don’t owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I’ll see what I’m interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I’m sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It’s *your* life and you shouldn’t be forced to date *anyone* you don’t want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don’t owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don’t owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*. I’m not saying *anything different* in this post.

One more edit: If you try to argue with me on something I covered in my post in a way that shows you *deliberately misread* it, I’m going to assume you’ve built a strawman argument to fight and I won’t engage with you on it. If I don’t reply to you, I’m not a coward. Your argument is just bullshit.",dating
261,Why men should message first in online dating,"Alright, so i'm just going to come out and say it: You guys should message first. However, the reason isn't because of traditional gender roles, but rather due to numbers and in improving your chances. I'm not sure what the average number of matches y'all get in a day is, but from what I've read, it seems like very little. 

Now, as you get a couple matches a day, the girls you're matching with likely get a dozen or more. I'm going to tell you this now, anyone who is currently working full time or living their life does not have the time to go message a dozen men in a day, and then maintain conversation with them all. What that means is we generally select a  couple of people who stand out among those dozen. How does that happen? They're the ones who messaged us.

I have been on tinder for a couple months now and  have over 200 matches. I have been watching and monitoring the percentage of matches who actually message first. I've come to find it is around 25%. When it comes to online, people really don't stand out enough just through pictures or bios, especially when everyone's profiles are the same regurgitated things. What im saying is that your best way of standing out is still through messaging. It is highly unlikely a girl is going to look at your profile alone and decide to message you out of a dozen. Why? Because online, everyone you've matched with also looks pretty damn equal due to them all having something you liked.

I'm not saying this is fair and I do wish it was much more balanced in online dating. I too have messaged men i was really interested in to just get no reply. I know it's really discouraging. However, it is about numbers and your best bet is still messaging first. Even if you don't get a reply, your chances are even lower through waiting for women to message first.",dating
262,"Guys, here are a few things you can do to tell if she’s not into you so you don’t have to waste your time or money on her","> Read her body language 

When she wants to talk to you she’ll make eye contact, she’ll be open, she’ll react as if she’s talking to someone and wants to continue the conversation.

If she’s closed off, turned away, is looking away from you, she probably doesn’t want to talk to you and is creeped out.

> If you have to schedule the date or meet up more than twice, she’s not really interested.

If she wants to go on a date with you, she will. If she’s busy constantly and makes no effort to find a date she can see you, she doesn’t want you. Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she’s busy both and she doesn’t say when she’s free, I’m out.

> If she doesn’t at least offer to pay she’s using you for a free meal.

It’s expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn’t, she doesn’t care what you think of her because she doesn’t like you. Move on.

> If you haven’t been physical by the fourth date, she’s not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven’t even made it to 2nd base she isn’t into you sexually. She might think you’re a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you’re not giving her sexual urges. It’s okay, this isn’t a deal breaker if you’re finej with waiting, but just be aware.

> Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I’m starting all the conversations, I’ll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don’t receive a text or call from her, I drop her. She’s obviously not as interested in me if I am the one initiating the conversations.",dating

Yet when a man says he's not into bigger girls he gets shit for it while most of you openly state you won't date bigger guys....

No shade or disrespect to my fellow men who would love for a woman to initiate the first meet-up, but it's just not for me.

To clarify, I have **zero problem** with a woman who's interested taking initiative in planning or suggesting **a second date** or anything beyond. For the first one, though, I believe that I should be the one doing the heavy lifting. Yes, there's usually the initial nervousness surrounding whether or not she'll say yes, but to me, that's a drop in the bucket compared to the long-term payoff that comes when she (or someone else if the first woman says she's not interested) says yes and you get to really make a good impression with planning and carrying out the first date. In my opinion, that shows a lot of initiative and it shows that you're a considerate man who knows what he wants. I personally wouldn't want a woman to ask me on the first date because I wouldn't want someone that I am interested in to think that I wasn't interested enough to do some work to get the ball rolling.

Now, obviously, some men will vehemently disagree and say that dating should be mutual from the get-go and we can toss our gender assumptions from the start. I have no argument there, I'm just sharing how I prefer things to be. I wouldn't want to plan *every* date because I do believe that some mutuality is necessary, but for the first one, I like to take care of it.

I am reading more and more men on here replying to the endless guys who say they can't get a single date talking about how they should pay women to date them like sugar baby arrangements. 

Do you think that is the new normal?

279,So I've matched with around 500 girls on dating apps,"About 3/4 never replied. The remaining 25% stopped replying at some point (usually after 3-4 texts). I've got a single date.

Just wondering why are girls on tinder if they have no intention of meeting up? It seems like they use tinder as a mobile game/validation tool.

The thing I hate most about it is, I have to spend so much time trying to come up with a funny opening line, because an average/above average line will never get a response. But that line can be wasted on someone who never opens the app, or just there for insta followers, or have no intention of meeting up overall, or just bored and want to talk to random strangers....

280,Am I the only one sick of girls complaining bout bein single on vday?,"It pisses me off so much bro they keep complaining like it’s not easy asf for them to get a guy to go out with, and before u hit me with that bs like “oh but he’s not the RIGHT one” you wouldn’t last a day in my shoes if u feel that way fuck looking for they right one I’m stuck here looking for ANYONE and I still continually fail. Not jus that they’re always like “oh guys just want me for sex I want sum deeper” or sum like I wish a girl would want me for ANYTHING, and sex, the most intimate thing you could do with another person? Yea just brush that off sex is probably undervalued to them cause they can get it so easily, meanwhile I’m so touch deprived that I fantasize about a girl hugging me atp the only physical contact I’ve ever had with a woman is a fucking handshake.

Men are literally falling flat on their face to worship women at every turn.  An attractive girl can post a pic on social media and immediately rack up hundreds of likes and comments. An equally attractive guy wouldn’t get a fraction of this attention. 

Girls are so inundated with advances that they will instinctively brush off even men they are attracted to. Guys are forced to develop “game” and spend endless hours on self improvement and trying to “stand out” whereas most women can just basically show up and get laid whenever they want. 

You can also see how desperate men are to win the favor of women in the rampant simping and white knighting taking place on social media. It’s really pathetic and has basically ruined dating.",dating
282,Had a very negative experience on Bumble,"I recently matched with this very pretty woman who was my age (mid-30s) and we began chatting. We were chatting about what kind of messages women like to get on bumble and she brought up dick pics. She said she hated unsolicited ones but liked them if they were from the right guy. I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied ""well, this might be a good time for your first."" I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small penis“ sign. It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing! I was so devastated! I wrote back and said ""how could you do this to me?"" and then she sent a pic of the four of them with their pants pulled down and they were mooning! I immediately unmatched her. I trusted her and she totally humiliated me. Is this how women usually act on bumble? I thought it would be a positive experience but it has turned out to be very negative.",dating

285,why have ugly guy-pretty/average girl couples vanished from the face of the earth?,"You've probably heard the statement a couple of times, of how ""even ugly guys can have beautiful girlfriends"". And indeed, back in the early 2000's, i could see quite a few, the occassional ugly guy with a drop dead gorgeous girl and some really average 6/10 guys with some pretty girls. It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street. Even in the celebrity world, this trend was apparent. I follow quite a few millenial actresses who play these coming of age comedies where they date nerds in the movie and stuff but was quite dissapointed when i found out their boyfriends in real life were all 100% handsome male models and not the geeky guys i shipped for on TV. From time to time, I also run into couples on my facebook update feed and not one did i see a girl dating an ugly guy. Instead, i see the opposite now, there are many ""ugly"" girls with drop dead gorgeous guys but none the other way around. the only couples i see that fit the bill of an average guy/pretty girl are those who are already in their late 30's or 40's today, never under 30. and even that is rare.

If you want to pump and dump men/women, you’ll never get anything emotionally gratifying in the long run. If you want to live that lifestyle, you should frequent women who work in fashion, entertainment, or modelling. In my experience, the average 24 year old professional class woman/men doesn’t want to be “sugardadied “ by some gallivanting bachelor in their 30s.

291,Feel like no one cares about having a pure and loyal gf anymore,"Recently I've been really frustrated and I've come here to rant about my non-existent love life. I feel like all men just want to date these toxic promiscuous women who post their bodies all over the internet and don't give a shit about a loyal kind gf who will always be there for them... 

Anyways what caused me to make this post is that I decided to start dating a guy. We were talking about our previous relationships (stupid I know). We eventually got to the subject of staying loyal/not cheating and being a virgin in a relationship. For me, I grew up with a strong opinion on having sex, where my mom said that men do care about how ""pure"" someone is regardless of what they actually say. Which is why I'm still a virgin since I am waiting for that special person who really cares about me and I don't want to be used just for my body... 

So I told him about my opinion on having sex, and then later in the convo he started talking about his previous relationship where his ex threatened to kill herself and cheated on him a lot. I told him he deserves better and that he shouldn't tolerate such behaviour. And then guess what? He starts talking to me less and less and eventually blocks me. Wtf. Then I heard from his friend ""he felt guilty talking to me since I was a virgin""? Nah it just turns out he was In a relationship the whole time and was cheating on her or got back with his toxic ex.

Ever since that happened I've been weary. After a week, I meet another guy who flirts with me. I do a little bit of stalking and it turns out he's in a relationship as well with another toxic promiscuous girl like the first. Wtf is going on? Do men just want to be abused and cheated on? I always thought they actually want to be loved but I guess that's not the case.

1. If you have a ton of typos, just don't say anything. Intelligence is attractive. 
2. Stop with the blurry photos!!!!!! This is almost 2022. Photos are not grainy. Oh and speaking of photos, stop using memes and pictures of other women and children in your life. We have no idea who these women are and if we date, I can see your children. It's not a turn on seeing you hugging your mom or taking your kids out. 
3. I don't care about your car, stop telling me about it or putting it in your profile. 
4. Blah, blah we are all honest, loyal, don't cheat.... Everyone says that. Tell me about you and don't forget to use spell check. 
5. Be honest about your intentions!!!! Some girls just want sex too 
6. Do not and I repeat, DO NOT offer a dick pic to any girl you are talking to until she has had it in her body. Biggest turn off ever and gets an immediate block. 
7. Can we go back to the picture thing again? Take a few close up but we need to see more than just your head. Let me see your upper body, let me see full shots. Put some effort in it. Ask your sister, ask your female friend, ask a Co worker to look at your profile. And even if you smoke,  get that out of your mouth and off your profile. It's not sexy. 

Stop complaining that you aren't successful on these sites when you have put zero effort into it!!!!!",dating
295,Guys who can’t handle rejection,"Went on a first date with a guy for light snacks and drinks. It went well. Very normal first date. It’s hard to tell whether there was a sparkle since it was only a first date. 

Before I met with him I hung with a male friend in the same plaza and my friend walked me to the restaurant where my date was waiting. 

Then we texted a bit after the first date. I’ve been swamped with work and moving to a new house so my texting was slow and I kept it concise. He asked to go on a hike two days ago. I actually don’t like going on a hike with people I’m not familiar with. But I forgot to text back. Guess I was thinking of how can properly turn him down in hiking. 

Then today he messaged me as below:

“You know i have never met someone like you before, swapping date next to another, and still feeling good about it. I didnt say anything and almost wantes to dump you in front of the restaurant. Anyway, i dotn have time to waste with such disgraceful person. Byebye”

296,I hate being criticized for having a preference for asian women as a white male,"I'm(27M) white, and ever since I started finding girls cute, I had a strong preference for asian women. I grew up in the bay area in California, and there is a large filipino and vietnamese population there. I was never criticized growing up for my preference, until I moved to florida when I was around 24 for graduate school. My preference became labeled by many as a fetish, and it made me feel very uncomfortable. I was even called a ""colonizer"" once. Not to my face, but still.  
I can see that in places where there is a very small demographic of asian ethnicities, the women get called ""exotic"", and they're looked at very differently than back home. I also see this online as well.  
My issue is trying to navigate this new hurdle I'm facing. To me, having a preference for asian women is no different than a preference for brunettes, or latinas, or blue eyes. So why do I get lumped in with the weirdos?

Women are too afraid of rejection. There it is. That's the secret. You no longer need to ask women this anymore. The secret is out.

However I end up paying for both drinks. Because paying for a girl these days doesn't make her like you or doesn't guarantee sex or sexual intimacy, it just means I'm wasting money buying drinks for girls who usually ghost me afterwards. I know 1/3 girls admitted to using men for free meals in a recent study, so I'm very wary of being used in this way.

What's the best way of stopping this? I don't want to pay for girls' drinks anymore. It's a waste of money and they're never grateful for it. But at the same time I want a drink myself. Thoughts?

303,"It's not that men only want sex, it's that no men finds you good enough to be his gf","Do you feel men only wants sex from you and its makes you feel men only wants sex and not relationship?

As a male I can say its not true. You have to understand how men think in order to understand this.

Let's first assume a scenario where a man meets his dream woman. Would he want only sex from her? No, of course not. He wants her to be his gf.

A dream woman does not exists but it's does not mean men does not have standards for a gf.
Now men have two standards:
1. For a gf.
2. for casual sex.

The standard of a gf is much higher than a casual sex. When you talk with some man and he thinks you don't fit to be his gf you may fit for casual sex. In that case he will try to sleep with you but not to have relationship with you. You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position. 

Women filter a lot for potential bf and it's acceptable, they just does not have or want to have a standard fit casual sex. 
Men filter a lot too for gf, they just can accept casual sex much easily. 

So if men only offer you sex it means none of them saw you as a gf option and try to think why.",dating

310,"Ladies: How do you know when someone is an ""Alpha Male""?","I (39M) was on a first date last night, and at one point as we start to talk about dating in general she (40F) mentions that she is into doms, and can even spot a ""fake dom"" from a ""real dom"", and then says she is really only attracted to ""alpha male"" personality types.

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dom and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways. Nothing really bad happened (I don't think), there just really wasn't much of any chemistry or connection.",dating

316,I think I'm done,"I've been dating a guy for around a month.  He would go on and on about how much he liked me, text me two, three times a day just to ask me how it's going, talk about how he was only looking for a serious relationship, introduced me to all his friends.  After the third date (and having sex) I found out he was dating someone else just as seriously as me.  (He also seemed like he wanted me to be mad about it, arguing that if I was doing the same things he would be upset and jealous.)  I was not okay with this but decided to move forward with the relationship thinking that I could get around it and try my best.  We had a discussion about it and I told him there would be a point were he needed to choose and he seemed okay with that.  

Now, this isn't a post about how one person has severely messed up my ability to date or that he is entirely a garbage human being because there were a lot of parts of him that I liked, and still do like, which just makes things harder.  I have had many dating experiences that have corroded my ability to trust other people in a romantic setting.  I can be intense when I have decided on someone, and my anxiety disorder does not lend well to that. I have always felt pressure to be a happy-go-lucky person when it comes to dating men because they don't want to see the bad stuff and if they do they see it as a red flag and immediately discount you.  So I tend not to admit what I'm thinking besides the good things and I made the mistake of trusting too early on this one.

Last night, we had sex and he was very distant afterwards, wouldn't touch me which is a big deal because aftercare is an incredibly important part of the sex I like.  Because I am incredibly blunt person (again not my best quality) I asked him whether he liked me or did he just like having sex with me and he said he did not know. which was not what I thought he was going to say.  Keeping in mind he spent the last month telling me how much he liked me and the six hours previous of us hanging out together making plans for the future, holding hands, cuddling, etc.   He said that if I had asked him last week (before me having the honest conversation about dating other people) it would have been a different answer.  

I don't think I've felt like that in a long while, my entire body went cold and I immediately started having a panic attack.  I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he explained why he couldn't commit to me as a person and that he didn't want to see me anymore because I couldn't physically leave, my legs and arms were complete rocks and I think in my head I wanted him to take it back.  Then I drove 45 minutes home back to my apartment alone because the idea of staying overnight there made me go into a deeper panic attack.

I think this incident might be the last straw for me for a while.  I don't think I'm ready to date in the way that so many people my age do, where there is always someone else you have to compete with for the persons attention.  I just want someone to choose just me (is that selfish? I don't know).

Yes my clothes are wrinkled but who’s aren’t. I’m rather well dressed, I wash my clothes every 2 weeks give or take. What happened to confidence and cleanliness being attractive. There’s nothing confident about trashy. I saw a pretty girl at the store today and she says hey babe to the guy behind me and I swear to you he came out of shitty hotel. He looked horrible and it genuinely pissed me off. Am I putting too much effort into myself to “Impress” these girls? I’ve been working on my confidence like I’m told to by other people from their advice. I can’t be a scumbag, yes I’m an asshole but it’s all in a comedic form.

319,THERE SHOULD BE NO SADDNESS ON VALENTINE'S DAY!!!!,"This post is made specifically for all those people that feel bitter on Valentine's day because they either can't get a date, their significant other is busy and can't spend time with them, or just have some excuse to be a BITTER BISCUIT on the holidays. This message is for all of you who are lurking online looking for some validation on why you are alone on February 14th

VALENTINE'S IS A DAY WE TRY AND USE AS A EXCUSE TO SHOW LOVE (and buy overpriced trash)!! SO LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU (at a reasonable price)!!

There is something MENTALLY WRONG with our society if it is odd to have someone spend the holiday all about love and showing your feelings NOT SHOW THOSE FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES

If someone thinks you can't celebrate Valentine's Day with some self love is full of BULLSHIT and the holiday is wasted on them. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for others, if not more

Just because you're by yourself on the holiday doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself! 

-Get your favorite food and eat it! 
-Dress so well that you look in a mirror and  can't resist telling yourself how fabulous you are!
-Indulge in yout hobby or passion that makes you have a enjoy your time on the world!
-Spend time with your other loved ones that and tell them how much they mean to you!
-Remind yourself that you're a star and deserve happiness!

LOVE YOURSELF

320,What is up with women anymore,"So I ""met"" this girl online and we hit it off over chat.  She's laughing, tells me I'm great. Flirting, the whole business.  Before she goes to bed, she says call me real quick so I can hear you voice before I go to bed.  So I call her up and we talk and laugh and everything seems awesome.  Two days later she texts me and tells me she isn't interested anymore, because I seem to have no confidence. 

So how shallow are women that they can make final judgments about someone based on a 10 minute phone call at 1 in the morning.  I'm really tired of women bitching about never finding anyone to date or marry.  This isn't the only time sometime like this has happened.  Why do you see women on dating sites that are 4'10"" requiring a 5'11"" man?  Well, hell, if you are so judgmental and picky after  only 10 minutes that it totally turns you off, then I hope you enjoy being a single, old maid.  

At what point did things change?  When did it become a man's job to be a comedian, an adventurer, a poet and the Dos Equis guy?  It used to be that women wanted a man who would love them forever and provide for them and raise a family.  Now, I have to be a exploding with confidence, funny man who feels the need to climb Mount Everest, bare chested and drinking a $300 scotch while holding her in one arm.

Give it a rest women.  **Most** of us are real human men.  We can't always be all of that stuff.  And sometimes I don't want to be any of it.  You do something interesting for a change and tell me a joke.",dating
321,How bad does he feel if the girl doesn't finish?,"I started dating a new guy and I really liked him. I knew him through brief interactions previously. We had sex. Though amazing, I was nervous. It was daytime, I was self conscious. I couldn't orgasm. He seemed very offput by this. Things seemed weird. He kissed me goodnight differently. A few days later I texted him ""You taking me to o-town??"" And he said ""lol apparently I don't know where that is.."" Then I said ""You know I'm hot for you. Be my hero"" 35 minutes later he didn't respond. I ended up ending it by saying ""Look, I know you're not that into me. It was fun, no hard feelings✌️"" And he said ""No hard feelings✌️"" My friend said I was wrong to end it, he does like me. I don't know if I should text him something more or not. Is this because I didn't orgasm?

Update: First of all, we did talk about this immediately after. I explained to him that I was self conscious, and that he was incredible. I also texted him and told him the next morning. I was trying to move past it, and there's more to the story as to why I made both of those comments to him, but it's too much to explain in this post.

I ended up texting him, completely opening up about how I felt and being honest about my thought process, and how I got scared he was going to break things off with me. He never texted me back. I really did not think he would be like that. I thought he would at least say something. That's ok though. I signed up for eHarmony so there's bound to be more sex and heartbreak in my future.

322,FWB slept with someone else,"Been on a few dates with this older girl- because of her age (37, im 32) its an unspoken thing but weve both understood its casual. We do go on dates and hang out its never been just sex.

Anyawy we were having sex a few days ago and she insisted I use a condom (which she hasnt before). At first it was because she kept saying she didnt trust me but then admitted its because she has been sleeping with someone else.I dont want anything serious with her so this saves the awkward what are we conversation I was worried we were heading for  - but at the same time I feel a bit weird knowing a girl Im sleeping with is also doing the same with other guys and just feel a bit ""simpish"" now asking her out on dates or to come over. I also just feel liek clearly the sex with me wasnt good enough that shes had to look elsewhere- usually when I have had fwbs in the past they dont hook up with other guys.

EDIT PLEASE READ:

SHe made it clear early on in the dates I was too young for her. This isnt my problem its hers. Secondly we never made it clear we were FWBs we were just dating early on and having sex...was never an explicit FWB thing however I understand we are not exclusive .

As many have mentioned it is clearly not the FWB thing that upset me it is her making me feel guilty for hooking up with other people (which I havent) and gaslighting me for it that clearly is the issue at hand",dating
323,Game over: I've found the absolute worst guy on OKCupid.,"""I'm looking for serious relationships only. I understand why others might just want to fool around, but for me, that's just not worth the hassle.

I have very specific and strict requirements, which is why I have to be very detailed in this profile and take myself a lot more seriously than I do in general. To think that I once swore I would never be that guy with the laundry list profile, and yet, here I am. Just as well, since the person I'm looking for would certainly love being bombarded with useful information and wouldn't shy away from an army of paragraphs.

Dealbreakers I should give you a heads up about: I am childfree and sterilized. I am against 3rd wave feminism and political correctness. I favor compatibility over chemistry. I enjoy sex but do not see it as more important than any other fun activity.

=== My principles and beliefs ===

I value truth above all, even above my or others' comfort. I believe in honesty, logic, pragmatism, directness in action and thought. Feelings and empathy have their time and place, but logic should always be at the core of one's life. While I don't go out of my way to wreck the illusions of everyone around me, whenever I am to express my beliefs and opinions, I do so openly and truthfully even if they may be uncomfortable for others. For me, there is no other way to be, and I am looking for someone who is the same: direct, brutally honest, level-headed.

I believe nothing should ever be guarded from examination or discussion. My thoughts and conversations can go anywhere, and so should yours. Nothing turns me off more than someone who has a taboo or goes out of their way to avoid offending anyone.

The world is full of misinformation and parties that would try to deceive us for their own gain, and as such, I believe that critical thinking and a skeptical attitude are two of the most important tools one can have in one's arsenal. I strive to keep these tools honed and ready and I ask the same of you. I need someone that is free of any major delusions and has a respectably high Bullshit Resistance Quotient.

I greatly value freedom and the principle of personal responsibility, and am allergic to any dogmatic or totalitarian system. We need to be in agreement on this. It bothers me deeply when someone believes they know better how other people should live their lives and that they would be willing to force those people to live according to their vision.

Christopher Hitchens is a good real-life example of what I strive to be like - not necessarily his specific ideas, but rather his general approach to life and discussion. A pity that no female clones of him are known to exist.

=== On feminism ===

Feminism seems to be a hot topic in the Western world nowadays, and one of frequent contention between me and most women, so it deserves a special mention. Let me begin by saying that I am all for gender equality of opportunity, which is to say that men and women should have equal rights and obligations, be equal in the eyes of the law, and be held to the same standard. Note that this does not imply equality of outcome, which is a result of their personal choices (which are not guaranteed to be the same) made within the context of those equal opportunities. That said, it is my firm opinion that 3rd wave feminism is not even remotely a force for actual justice and equality, and instead shows all the hallmarks of a dangerous cult. I will not go into details here, but suffice it to say that if you genuinely believe that there is such a thing as a ""patriarchy"" or ""rape culture"", ""white privilege"", etc., you are a victim of indoctrination and the best thing for us would be to not cross paths. There is no way I can convince you that you're in the wrong within a short amount of time, no more than I could convince a devout Christian that Jesus is no more real than Santa Claus.

=== On relationships ===

I don't share and I don't play games. You're either with me, or you're with someone else. You're either interested, or you're not. I understand why others might like toying around or poly relationships, but that's not my thing. Banter, vagueness and mystery are more suited for teens and few have the talent to do them well anyway.

On the other hand, don't think that we'll be joined at the hip. A healthy relationship means we each have our own awesome lives and interests, which are regularly enhanced by our partner's presence. I need my own space and I will only too gladly allow you yours. Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between time spent together and time spent apart.

On love, infatuation and 'chemistry': I view all forms of irrational attraction the same way I view drugs, which, ultimately, they are. Drugs can be fun and provide unique experiences, but I would not take important decisions while under their influence, and most certainly not allow them to rule my life in general. It seems to me people only really start to understand this well into their 30s, but I'm hoping you may be precocious in that regard.

=== On sex ===

For reasons mostly beyond my control, I happen to be still a virgin. This is not a big deal for me and my expectation is that it will not be a problem for you, either. I certainly want our relationship to be physical, and the way I see it, there will be plenty of time for us to work over any initial inexperience and awkwardness.

I felt I had to mention this because I have noticed that many women on dating sites, if their profiles are to be believed, seem to be inordinately preoccupied with sex (a resounding failure of stereotypes if ever there was any) and very strict about the frequency and performance requirements involved, far more so than for more, one would think, more fundamental aspects of compatibility such as character and principles. This mindset is simply alien to me.
What I’m doing with my life
I work full-time as a software engineer at a pretty cool company and I am lucky enough to enjoy it most of the time. I naturally plan to develop my career further and perhaps even strike out on my own some day. Engineering is probably the best field to be in nowadays and the palette of options is enormous, if only you are committed to constantly bettering yourself and learning new things. Which I am, and you likely will be, too.

In my free time, which, sadly, never seems sufficient, I bite into that ""to-read"" list of mine that never seems to stop growing (mostly non-fiction nowadays), and, like any geek, work on personal software and hardware projects, and enjoy the occasional video game.

I am also seriously studying the piano. I have had my grade 1 exam recently and plan to take this as far as it will go. My current dream in this regard is to be able to play Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto and not have (too many) rotten tomatoes thrown at me. Realistically, it will take decades to get to that level, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

I go to the gym regularly, fighting that eternal battle of keeping healthy and in shape. I also enjoy bouldering / indoor climbing and, though I've had to pause it due to an injury, I hope to be able to get back into it soon.

I have grand plans for the next years, in that I would like to try scuba diving and skydiving, as well as visit the world, in particular ancient ruins and generally areas less spoiled by human presence. Perhaps I will also consider taking up drawing again, as I used to be quite good at it back in the day.

Most importantly, and this is something where we absolutely must agree completely, my plans for life do not include children. I feel no need for them and I am not willing to make the near total sacrifice they require. I think one either lives for one's children, or one lives for oneself. And lord knows, there is still a lot of living I intend to do for myself. To avoid accidents and other issues, and to be sure that the capabilities of my body are in agreement with my lifestyle, I have had a vasectomy and am now sterile. There is thus no room for negotiation on this topic, but if you are the right woman for me, chances are this will not have even occurred to you, and you might well be sterilized yourself. I do not require this of you, but it would go a long way into demonstrating that you are equally committed to a childfree life.

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:

First, anything featuring good humor. So pretty much anything British, with a special mention for Monty Python, Fry&Laurie, and, for books, Terry Pratchett (who somehow manages to stick a plot and characters we care about, as well as pretty much half of TVTropes in any of his books).

I also like anything bizarre, that plays with conventions and the reader (""mindfuck""), is psychological, sappy, tragic, dystopian, meta or various combinations of these. Think Kafka, Brazil, Kynodontas, and nearly all manga. While we're on that subject, I'd like to state that I consider comics and videogames to be absolutely serious forms of art, and anyone that thinks any different is begging to be on the receiving end of my Adama Glare.

I can be quite eclectic with my music, but a large part of what I like is Romantic classical/opera (Beethoven, half of Mozart, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Glazunov), and anything based on blues (Satchmo, early rock'n'roll, 60-70s bands) with a special mention for The Who and The White Stripes. I also adore Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, TMBG and Lemon Demon.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
Many, many, many things. Thinking is something I do a lot, and I'm not ashamed to say it. To give you an example: how eventually humans and robots are destined to merge and become beings that we could never hope to understand. Not all of my thoughts are that serious, of course,

Also, when I'm in a classical mood I can spend quite some time replaying entire operas and symphonies. In my head. In their entirety. Feel free to back away slowly.

You should message me if:

You are direct, honest, pragmatic, savvy, not afraid to speak your mind or question anything and everything.

You have your life together, you know what you want, and are past the games and vacillations of teenagers.

You do not have, or want, children, and are are very confident in this decision.

You know that life involves a constant drive to learn new things and better oneself. You have the patience to work on yourself, and let your partner work on himself as well.

You have an excellent, one might say even wicked, sense of humor. You enjoy all kinds of jokes, from the nonsensical to the morbid and naughty.

You want us to meet and see how we get along in person, instead of passing around boring emails :)

Not that it will get you off the hook, but I admit to a weakness for dark eyes, a fringe cut, and well defined eyebrows. Think Winona Ryder.""

324,"Women do want sex as much as men, but here's the thing...","I am of the mindset that men and women have an equal desire for sex. Women of course have far more access to sex and that's where the confusion comes in, men don't have nearly the ability to get sex as women do so how can you say both equally want sex?

So here's the thing...for men we rarely have truly bad sex. And what's bad sex? Sex so poor that you would rather not have had it. Most men can have not great sex, or just ok sex but sex so awful you would have rather just beat off? Thats not common for men. Without trying to brag I've had less than 60 sex partners but more than 10, somewhere in there and I can count on one hand how many times I've had truly bad sex where i wish she didn't come over or I had stayed home and I believe most men would say similar things. For women however it's very common to have bad sex. A guy can have a small d*ck, a big d*ck and not know how to use it, he might cum really quickly he might not be that experienced etc etc etc. So what happens is women will want sex but she also knows that if she has sex with a new guy she is possibly more likely to have bad sex than good sex. This is why when women have a partner or a guy who gives them good sex their sex drive is so high because they know they will get quality sex from them.

So this is why it often looks like women don't want sex as much as men...they have access to far more potential partners then men do but for them its quantity over quality and for men it's the reverse.

325,I am done finding the right girl. They just don’t exist at least in today’s society.,"(25)M in search of right girl met many but they always want something else. Either they say not looking for anything right now while she is active on dating apps. They will say I am a good friend but they don’t want anything else, if I don’t lose my feelings then we should never see each other. They will come to me when they need something, rant about bad guys whole night to me say I am a very good catch but never say they would like to go on a date. I get rid of girls who text me after a week on dating sites or any other place while she was active. When they need attention they text so I just get rid of them by blocking or un match them. 

Girls how could be someone a good partner but you still keep looking around, either you should not lie or just be good friends and don’t give I want a guy like you explanations with expectations. You choose a nice guy who is just a red flag in plain sight or you choose an actual red flag but the guy who literally gives you hope for treating you right you skip them in the face. 

Then there is this sentence you will find someone better. Women whatever you are that’s completely perfect in its way to be loved. 
Don’t know where it will lead but you are perfect for him so give it a chance. I am talking about giving chance to good soul.

Also you say wait for the girl who will love you same way you love her. It’s been tough days and years without her where is she. I hope she is not in group with you all girls whom I know because you all have surely given her bad advice. 

I feel like Ted mosby sometimes who keeps waiting for the right girl while all of them just pass by hurting. I have never dated or done hookup.

I'm sorry but 90% of communication is non-verbal, right? I'm convinced online dating apps are just money-making schemes that convince people they can find someone sitting on their ass in their own home when in reality meeting someone requires *actual* effort, aka going out alone to activities you enjoy & talking to random people, male or female.

A wide social circle is the best way to meet people. And I say that as an introvert who doesn't naturally enjoy that process. I met my boyfriend at an art museum after years of going there alone hoping to meet a fellow person into art.

Online dating promises you'll meet someone easily; real life teaches you everything takes long-term effort.

And yes, some people find their partners on OLD, but most people on OLD aren't super invested in it or want validation, so you're wasting your time yet so lazy or deluded you don't put the real work into meeting people irl, and then whine you've been on OLD for years yet had zero success.

Most are guys that really have nothing much going for them, at least they seem decent enough to strike up a good conversation with, but the potential partner qualities just aren’t there.
You end up getting used more often than not and usually the frustration of finding a mate is more aggravation than it’s worth.
And when I do find someone attractive, everything is great up until they start to talk, which reveals they are extremely shallow and that gets annoying/disappointing fast.

Why do I always get hit on by the unattractive, weak men? It may sound a little harsh but I’m honestly sick of getting pursued by the undesirable.. Is there something I can do to change this? Or is it inevitable?

They usually live with their parents, socially-awkward, no money, effeminate, no assertive nature, etc. 

Is this what the average woman has to settle for now?

When you sit back passively and wait for guys to pursue you, you get who you get. I get that.

334,Getting a girlfriend (a.k.a winning) should NOT be your end goal!,"Hello, to the incredible dating community!

After being active for several months here, I've seen most of the guys are trying to get a girlfriend no matter what. In other words trying to win. Trying to get what they need.

Unfortunately, in building a healthy dating life, that's the worst thing you can do. Let me explain you why!

So, in my mid twenties I didn't have a clue about women, how to date, how to not getting ghosted and how to get on a date through dating apps.. I was clueless, lonely and depressed. All I wanted was someone to understand me, hug me, and have beautiful moments with..  In my mind it was always: I want to get a girl, I want to have a relationship. 

👉The truth is, I was focusing on the end goal, which basically was to ""win the girl"". And every time I wasn't ""winning"", I was getting back thinking ""oh I have to be more handsome"", ""I have to build muscles"", ""I have to be perfect for the girl"", ""make more money"", watching endless YouTube videos about dating and social skills.. False perfectionism, in other words.

👉And slowly, but steadily, I wasn't reaching my goals of being perfect, and that led me to procrastinate, and slowly giving up on the dating game. Every time that I had the opportunity to ""play with girls"" at the back of my head I was thinking ""I am not perfect yet, I am sure she will reject me"". And of course, being out of the game for so long, I stopped learning. And because I stopped learning, I was failing to get what I wanted. So I was stuck in this endless cycle of either I lose or I win.. 

And then again, because I wasn't winning, I was feeling discouraged and of course, I entirely GAVE UP. Again, feeling lonely and depressed and of course not good enough..

✅ So, after some months of deep thinking and  by getting help by others, I start changing my mindset!! I stopped trying to win, but I've put all my focus on LEARNING!! You know why? Because, if your goal is to always learn, you CANNOT LOSE, and that's a beautiful thing! This was the opposite of perfectionism! Basically, every action I was taking was learning something new, by real life experience. So, just by taking small action steps, I was learning something new every time, and because my goal was to learn, I was WINNING EVERY TIME!!! Either I was learning something wrong or right, at the end of the day, I was learning and so again I was winning.

And, INEVITABLY as long as you do this, being in the cycle of learning, you are going to get more dates, and maybe the girl. And that will boost your self-confidence, and you will learn more and more. Will you be 10/10 confident? Of course not! But, adding up a little bit of self- confidence every time you take action is the only way to be successful.

And this my friend is the awesome cycle of building your self-confidence. An upward spiral of learning and learning and learning! 

So, if you read this post, stop focusing on winning, but put ALL OF YOUR FOCUS ON LEARNING!",dating
335,"I don't want to be the ""settle-down, safe option guy"".","**Note: Please read the entire post before commenting, because nothing pisses me off more than someone reading and focusing only one part of a post without getting the full context.** 

I know this might come off as an irrational fear. But I'm almost 28, with no dating experience. I feel like I missed out on the youthful dating experiences, and it makes me angry. And I refuse to be the ""settle-down, safe option"" guy. You know the guy women don't pay attention to during their ""wild years"", but now that they are ""ready to settle down"" they're finally interested. Granted, I'm not exactly a high earner. In fact, I'm only now finally close to getting what people consider a ""real job"" (I graduated college late, so yeah.). And I'm still working a little over minimum wage. 

I know I have to resolve this before anything else. I'm not even bothering with dating right now, because my job search is my main priority. But I want to make it clear, I am doing it for myself. I want to make a comfortable living. But I am not interested in being a corporate slave, and I'm definitely not interested in being some ""provider-type"" to some woman who's ""looking to settle down"". I want to experience the fun, youthful side of dating, where there are no ""end-goals"". Just sort of let things happen naturally (which is how dating should be anyway), without having the end in mind. And if it works out, great. And if it doesn't, hey at least I gained experience.

 I am against the idea of marrying the first girl I date. Heck I don't even know if I want to get married ever (maybe I'll change my mind someday, but maybe I won't). And before anyone says ""What if she's the perfect match?"" or ""What if she's inexperienced too?"". You are talking about a less than 1% possibility at best. Like seriously, both instances are exceptionally rare. 

So I refuse to be the ""safe option"" or ""end game"" for women who have the ""fun out of their system"" and are looking to ""land a husband"". I especially refuse to date women who are concerned about salaries. Cause chances are, they are looking for a ""husband/provider"" type too.",dating

In my entire 23 years of life I have almost never seen a black man with even a semi-attractive women, black guys usually take whatever we can get because we know women **do not want us** at all and will only date us due to desperation or mental illness; idgaf about celebrities and athletes 

Most women who sleep with black men see it as bestiality if they are not black themselves, and if the woman *is* black she won't think that way certainly but if the guy is short sorry bucko he's just jerking himself off and will die alone 

Asian men whine and complain constantly but I cannot comprehend it, China will likely rule the world by 2100 so Asian men will get all the attention anyway and the average asian man imo does better with women than the average black man, black men just have absolutely *no standards at all* so manage to get laid more

No woman has ever had a romantic fantasy about a black man

And 

>Muh preference

Preferences don't exist when the only racial preference women have is European **white** men and the preference is mostly a requirement

Pretty much no woman on most of this planet has any sort of preference that would exclude a *white* man but almost *every* woman on the planet Earth exclude black men from their preferences and hate them and are disgusted by them

***NOW,*** that's not true, but given the amount of instances I have experienced of trying, along with others, to impart constructive advice and input based on personal preferences and success stories and having them angrily and insecurely dismissed, I figured I'd finally just cave and tell you what you're so desperately clamoring to hear.  


You have a choice between two narratives: the first, that due to your poor hand in genetic poker, you are inherently and immutably destined to live out a life of loneliness and rejection as a result of the inherent deviousness of superficial ***f e m a l e s***, and nothing can ever change that; or, the second, that maybe, *just maybe*, there are factors within your control that are not insignificant contributors to your lack of romantic success, and that things *can*, in fact, get better. ***Bottom line***, which of those two would you prefer to subscribe to?  


Listen, assholes, I used to be like you. In my teen and early college years I was chronically romantically unsuccessful and single, I had internalized some misguided and misogynistic notions of social interaction and ways that women think (spoiler alert: it actually turns out they're people just like you), I reacted with anger and spite when rejected, and was generally getting increasingly and increasingly bitter and misanthropic. During this interval, I did little-to-no substantial self-examination, so I never really significantly improved. At some point, via emotional maturation as well as the influence of platonic friendships with many women, I began to become aware of the flaws in my personality that were largely turning people off in romantic *and* platonic capacities. Were these realizations of my failings and missteps fun to acknowledge and grapple with? Hell no, but I took them seriously anyway and began putting in serious and dedicated work in order to improve my social and romantic lot-- *as well as just make myself feel generally better!* Fuck's sake, don't do it for other people-- do it for your own peace of mind.  


As time went on, I went from going largely unnoticed and routinely rejected by women to getting lots of positive romantic attention and becoming fairly sought out and successful. Currently, I'm well over a year into the best relationship I've ever been in with someone about whom I feel more strongly and who is a better fit for me than anyone I've ever known before. This shift has occurred gradually over the past decade, and I can tell you with a significant degree of certainty that I am both the same height and race now as I was ten years ago when I was perpetually romantically unsuccessful, so, I don't know, maybe it was about less superficial factors and I'm onto something here.  


Five-to-ten years ago I could have succumbed to the narrative that I was, due to factors out of my control, destined to be undateable and alone ad infinitum. But that would have been weak and cowardly. Instead, I chose to take the harder tack and grow the fucking stones to look my flaws in the face and put forth the work to fix them and, in doing so, myself. And things got better. Things got *a lot* better-- with no substantial changes to my physical appearance.  


The choice is yours, boys-- which I refer to you as because your behavior is closer in kind to immature children than any kind of emotionally-developed adult. This sub *reeks* of the indication that y'all don't actually want any constructive criticism or to put forth any kind of effort to actually improve your lot, and instead just want mindless validation of the a priori narrative you've subscribed to because it's easier and absolves you of any semblance of accountability or responsibility. You can make the harder choice to do some deep diving and turn inward to make significant positive changes, or you can take the spineless route of giving into your toxic narrative and continue to believe that you are inherently insufficient, unfuckable, and unlovable. Because I'll go ahead and tell you that if you want to hear it.  


But it's a fucking pathetic choice and makes you just the same.",dating
340,I am just fucking sick and tired of not having access to affection or sex,"I’ve literally done everything I possibly can at this point during these lonely times. I’ve tried all the dating apps. Tried all the advice I’ve gotten on how to do dating apps right. When I couldn’t get a single date with a girl I started dating men. That didn’t really do it for me. I am so much more attracted to women. Then I started experimenting with gender fluidity and I’m now thinking I’m trans but attracted to women. So I tried dating women as a lesbian too. And as a trans woman. Mostly a bunch of scammers on those apps.

Maybe I just need to get my balls hacked off asap and just get on hormones. That may very well destroy my libido and it would be for the best. This is where I’m at. I’m sick of my sexual desire. It’s a dead end. Loads of demand with zero supply. That’s what this market looks like apparently.

I really don’t get why it has to be like this. If everyone were like me, we’d all just be fucking left and right not as the stupid power play it currently is but because we genuinely enjoy it. And more importantly, we enjoy pleasing other people. And we want them to be happy.

Am I the only person out there desperate to sexually please someone? Anyone? At all? Just to watch their face wash over in ecstasy? Even if I don’t get off? Then why can’t we figure something out? Ffs",dating
341,Why do people value marriage still?,"When I was a teen I thought that I'd get married and have kids one day because that's how life goes.

Now as a 28 year old man I don't see the point, marriage is a concept that has been around for ages, it's main purpose has been to guarantee a woman kids and financial security because women had so few options in many cultures.

But today there's no point women have all the opportunity, maybe even preferential treatment in society most post secondary graduates are women and all it takes to lose your job is a bad accusation from a woman.

For men it's all financial risk you could end up paying alimony for the rest of your life, child support for the next 18+ years and the family courts give women most of the valuable assets.

I may sound angry or bitter but these are the facts I'm honestly neither since I don't plan on having kids or be married I'm just wondering why some people put so much value on marriage when there's really no need for it and co habitation has become the norm.",dating

344,Why you should never have a serious relationship with a girl that puts out on the first date......,"tldr at the bottom

&#x200B;

I met a girl back in the mid 80's who was stranded along the side of the road with the hood of her 1983 Corvette up in the air.  I gave her a ride home and arranged for my friend with a tow truck to pick it up and bring it to the Chevy Dealership.  We got to talking, then went out for dinner, drinks, and some dancing that same night.  We hit it off.  I dropped her back off at her very large home on Lake Minnetonka (a newer McMansion type) and thought I would give her a very nice goodnight kiss and that would be it.  

&#x200B;

She wanted more, much, much more.  She invited me in and against my better judgment but not able to fight the raging hormones of a young man in his very early 20's, I accepted it.  She asked me to sleep with her and we did everything but sleep lol.  I was seeing a pattern form in my early years where I would ask a woman out on a date and we would end up sleeping together the first night.  Shortly after, the relationship would crash and burn because relationships built on sex, rarely succeed.  It takes a certain type of crazy woman to sleep with a man on a first date.  They usually are NOT long term relationship material.

&#x200B;

However, we seemed to get along really great and she was richer than God and didn't have a problem ""sharing"" her wealth with me.  Her daddy owned a large private corporation and she was a VP in it.  She was loyal, faithful, not overly clingy unless we were alone, had no problems with me going out or hanging out with my friends, in fact, she encouraged it telling me she had no doubts I was faithful to her.  We simply got along and ""Got"" each other.  She would never turn me down for sex or a blow job no matter how tired she was or even volunteered to do it if she was sick.

&#x200B;

Things were just humming along great in our relationship and she even went on the pill so we didn't have to use condoms even though the pill made her ill from time to time.  She bought me expensive gifts I didn't ask for like my own 1969 Corvette, a new Ford F150 that was jacked up and a replica ""Captain America"" Chopper from the movie Easy Rider that she had custom built.  While I accepted the gifts, I felt uneasy about taking them and demanded they stay titled in her name.  She agreed as long as if we got married some day (something she always dropped very subtle hints about) then they along with EVERYTHING she owned, would be titled in our names together.  She even said she would not allow me to sign a pre-nup because she just KNEW when, not if, we got married we would be together forever.

&#x200B;

But alas, there were some cracks that started to show in our relationship, personality quarks if you will, on her part.  They were slow to happen and started off very minor.  So slow, I didn't even notice them.  One day she asked me to move in with her into her 9 bedroom Mansion.  I agreed and it took me about 2 hours to pack my stuff and have it all moved in and put away.  I really didn't have much and I didn't need much as her home had everything.

&#x200B;

After I moved in I noticed she was trying to slowly change me, first it was the way I looked and dressed.  I was always a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy with work boots or tennis shoes.  She had me visit a tailor who custom made some suits for me to have.  I worked construction most of the year and was finishing my college degree up as well.  When I asked her why she had so many suits made up for me she said that my 6'7"" 240 lb muscled frame just looked so damn sexy in them.  She was right, I did look damn good in them and started wearing them whenever we went out to dinner, etc.  About the only time I didn't wear them when we went out was when we went to a Minnesota Twins or Vikings game that she had season tickets to.

&#x200B;

She also started dropping seriously hard hints about getting engaged and married.  Whenever we went shopping at the mall she would stop and look at the Rings at different Jewelers.  Mind you, these ""Rings"" were NOT the ones you see in the display cases, they were ones that were brought out from the vault and you had to sit in a small private room to look at them.  Most of them were north of $40k.  I would tell her I couldn't afford those types of prices and she said I could since all of her money would be OUR money.  She even shared the balances in the several bank accounts she had with me and she had already accumulated a couple of million not including her investments. 

&#x200B;

One day I got home from work early because of a rain day and that was the day our relationship crashed and burned.  No, I didn't come home to her screaming in orgasmic bliss while being banged by some guy.  IT WAS WORSE.......

&#x200B;

As I walked into the house, the phone was ringing so I answered it.  It was my loving girlfriend, she was at work and needed some papers that were in her home office (one of the 9 bedrooms in the house).  She asked if I could run them over to her office and I told her no problem.  As I walked down the hall, fate or something like that, intervened in my life.  I heard the very light sound of music, almost like a jewelry box music, just for a few seconds coming from one of 2 of the bedrooms that were always locked that I never looked in. She had told me they were just loaded with her stuff that she had no place to put but was from her childhood and she just didn't want to get rid of it.

&#x200B;

I kept going to her office, grabbed the papers but stopped and decided to look around in her office for keys to those rooms.  Sure enough, they were in one of the drawers of her desk.  I opened the first room up, the one the music had come from and it was very dark.  I turned the light on and what I saw was astounding.........  The room was full of brand new baby stuff.  There were 4 cribs, several hanging mobiles above them (this was the music sound I had heard).  There were boxes and boxes of baby diapers, clothing, toys, etc.  I walked in and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  WTF was all this stuff doing in there???

&#x200B;

In another twist of fate, as I was inside the room checking all the stuff out, the door slowly closed most of the way shut.  I was thinking her and I needed to have a serious discussion about the contents of this room.  While I MIGHT be willing to marry her soon, I didn't want kids for several years yet.  I was only 21 at the time.  As I turned to leave, I saw the back of the door and on it was several large calenders with weeks blocked off and a couple of days circled.  It didn't take a genius to tell she was using them to track her fertility schedule.  On top of the dresser was a nearly empty prescription bottle that was home to some fertility pills in them.  Alongside was some information about taking them and what kind of results could be expected regarding a pregnancy.

&#x200B;

What really freaked me out was what the fertility pills looked like.  I quickly ran into our master bath and checked the medicine cabinet and pulled out the bottle of her ""Speciality"" Birth Control Pills.  The ones she said the Doctor had prescribed so she wouldn't get as sick as the normal pills that came in a daily reminder container......

&#x200B;

THE FERTILITY PILLS AND HER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME.

&#x200B;

She WASN'T taking Birth Control Pills as she told me, she was taking Fertility Pills.

&#x200B;

At this point, I had to sit down on the bed and chill out as I was nearly hyperventilating.

Suddenly I decided I needed to see what was in that other locked room.  I went and unlocked the door, braced myself for probably seeing even more baby stuff but when I turned the light on...........IT WAS EVEN WORSE.

&#x200B;

THE ROOM WAS SET-UP LIKE A SHRINE......................... TO ME.

&#x200B;

There were pictures all over the walls of me from not only the time we started dating but what appeared to be several months before that as some of them I was with some other women I had been seeing BEFORE I met her.  There was also a file cabinet in the room and it had tons more pictures in them as well as what appeared to be reports from a Private Investigation company on and all about me.  On the walls next to some of my pictures were things about me like my favorite foods, bands, hang-outs, etc.  

&#x200B;

Somehow, they knew things about me that I would only tell people I knew OR WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW.  That's when I found out, the last 2 ladies I was seeing were plants from the P.I. Company to essentially do Recon on me.

&#x200B;

I had a very odd mixture of feelings from feeling impressed someone did all this to ""meet me"" to feeling fear, anger and violated.  Suddenly, that ""Chance"" meeting from her Vette being broken down on the side of the road that I took on the way to my parents home in the country, didn't seem like such a ""Chance"" anymore.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do at that moment, I wanted to burst into her office and demand a ""Why, What is going on"" explanation.  I also felt like I wanted to just RUN away, fast and far.  I was known for making stupid rash heat of the moment decisions back then and this day would be no different.  I walked out of the room, called her up and told her I had a dead battery in the truck and because this was later in the fall, the motorcycle and Vette were both put away for the winter.  Because of this, I would have to wait for a while for the battery to charge.  She could tell something was wrong and when she asked I lied and told her it was stuff that happened at work today and I would tell her about it later.  She told me ok and then said not to worry about getting her the papers, she was going to just come home in a few hours and wanted to talk with me about some things.  I told her ok I would see her then.

&#x200B;

About 3 minutes after I hung up with her, I started to freak out and quickly packed all of my things I had when I moved in and left ALL of the things she had bought me, undisturbed.  I did go back into the ""Shrine Room"" and gathered all the pictures of me and the reports and brought them down and put them on the dining room table.  I then called a friend of mine and told him I needed a ride and for him to pick me up.  He did and saw the few duffle bags I had packed and I told him about everything.  He wanted to see it for himself and so we went in and I showed him.  The look on his face was priceless and probably a lot like mine was when I discovered it all.

&#x200B;

My friend told me I should take some of the pictures and reports for any evidence that I might need for later and thankfully I listened to him.  He told me I could hang out at his place for a while and he would cover for me.  While at his house we started drinking some and a few of my other friends came over and they promised when she called to say they hadn't seen me.  But they suggested I get out of Dodge really quick because she would probably send the P.l. Company out looking for me.

&#x200B;

I was really on the verge of losing what was left of my mind about this.  I made another Rash decision and reached into my backpack I used at the University and pulled out a card I had been given by a man who had been recruiting me hard for a job opportunity.  They had said I met all of their criteria for a position that was available because I could speak both German and Russian, fluently.  My Russian even had a Czech accent thanks to my Gramma Helen who taught it to me when I was a kid. 

&#x200B;

I dialed the number and told the man I was in and how soon could I leave for training.  He told me since I was already approved and had passed all the background checks (none of them I had agreed to), he could have me on a plane down to Langley by the coming weekend.  I told him I wanted to do it so he set it up.

&#x200B;

My flight was leaving Saturday afternoon and all I had to do was stay off of her radar until then, 4 days.  I called my parents and told them what was going on and what I was doing.  They said I was being impulsive and I should go back and talk with her.  I told them it wasn't going to happen.  They did not like the idea I was joining the CIA but knew there was little they could do about it.

&#x200B;

For the rest of the week, I rarely went out and when I did it was for short periods of time.  My friends had all been contacted by her numerous times and she was crying and pleading to them to get a message to me that she needed to talk with me and explain what was going on and what I had seen wasn't really what I thought it was.  HUH???

&#x200B;

Saturday came and I met the man at the Airport where he gave me my ticket and all the information I would need when I got there.  As I was walking away towards my Airline Gate, I was stopped by 4 Police Officers and 6 Airport Security Guards.  They had me turn around and handcuffed me.  The CIA recruiter saw this and asked the Police what was going on and they told him to back off or they would cuff him too.  Their demeanor changed the second he pulled out his CIA credentials and suddenly the Police became very compliant.  They said I was being arrested for Sexual Assault and RAPE.

&#x200B;

Apparently, my EX-girlfriend had found out I was flying out of the Airport that day and in a desperate move to prevent it, had told the Police that I had forced myself on her the previous night and assaulted and raped her.  The Police had to take me in and when I got there and was processed, she was able to come into the room I was being questioned in and confessed to everything in front of me.  Luckily, the Police were observing on the other side of the glass and had a video camera running in the room so they heard her say she made it all up to stop me from leaving because she wanted to explain things to me.

&#x200B;

I told her she was completely insane and needed Professional Help.  She got mad and told me she did all of it because she LOVED ME and had Loved Me since we had met at a bar in Minneapolis about 6 months before I ""rescued"" her alongside the road.  She said we danced a few times, talked a bit, and that we even made out in a booth at the bar for a while.  I didn't remember any of this but I do remember getting pretty drunk a few times back then at the bars so I actually did believe her.  She said when I held her dancing to a slow song and leaned down to kiss her during it, her body was blasted with electric pulses she had never had in her life and just knew I was ""The One"".  

&#x200B;

All she had was my name and the fact I worked construction and was finishing up my final year at the University to go off of so she contacted a P.I. Company her Company uses and had them find me and do all kinds of checks on me.  She said it was for their Corporation when it was really for her, personally.  I told her we were DONE and I didn't want to ever speak or see her again.  Then she dropped another bomb and said she might be pregnant as her period was late.

&#x200B;

What I told her next was so shocking to even me, I knew I had to get away from her.  I told her if she is, she should get an abortion (something I am dead set against) as I didn't want to have a kid(s) with her, EVER.  I also told her if she didn't, I wanted Paternity tests taken and that hit her hard because she knew that I normally would have trusted her completely.  I told her I could NEVER trust her again after seeing the deception she had pulled off.  I started screaming for the cops to come back into the room and get her out of there.  Nobody was more surprised than I was when they came in and put the cuffs on her and charged her with reporting a false crime.

&#x200B;

They ended up letting me go and my CIA buddy was waiting for me in the lobby.  He called and got me on the next flight out of there and it was to Atlanta Georgia where I would stay the night in a Hotel before flying out to Langley the next day.

&#x200B;

I never heard or saw my EX-Girlfriend again.  Although, after spending 3 years working for the CIA during the end of the Cold War, I was starting to think spending my time with her would have been less horrible lol.  And NO I WAS NOT A SPY.  Believe it or not, there are thousands of us people that did the REAL, not very sexy work at the CIA.  5 Days after I left the CIA I was heading for Orlando, Florida and to Navy Basic Training.  After that day I left Minnesota heading for my training with the CIA, it was several more years before I ever went back home to Minnesota.

&#x200B;

When I did, I essentially went from the Frying Pan that was my Ex-Girlfriend into the Fires of Hell at the hands of a very hot ex-beauty queen (another first date sex conquest), that would become my wife and eventually, my ex-wife after I testified at her Drug Trial.  But that is a story for another time.

Run, as fast you can. Why? At the beginning of the relationship it will seem lovely, safe and comforting to spend every weekend watching Netflix with your new love.

You’ll think “wow, this person is perfect” we never fight about “getting drunk with the boys/girls” etc. until you realize this person is actually incapable of dealing with the world and ALL they do outside of work is escape in gaming or series. A few years down the line you’ll notice how isolated and lonely your life has become. In this new word we live in, this is becoming more and more of a problem, with people more addicted to their screens than ever. But I’m telling you, these people do not make good partners.

347,NSFW ? Small penis but dream man,"Hi guys
This is such a vapid post and I never thought I'd say something like this but I have met my dream man, he ticks all of my boxes and we connect like crazy, its wild because I just got divorced after 7yrs with my ex so I'm very aware of the fact this guy is an exceptional fit for me.

I really could spend my life with this man but.... I can't get past the fact he has a small, thin penis. I know I'm awful.
My ex husband was a tall guy and his penis was about 9inches. And this guy isn't even half that.

My question is, is there a way I can get past the penis size? I enjoy penetrative sex more than any other style.

I wish I could get over it and be with him properly but it's definitely holding me back.

He's also quite big and not my physical type, so that also doesn't do much for me?

Ticks all boxes except the physical and I wonder if it's possible to be with someone long term without that attraction?

- Trying to tease a woman then following up with ‘just kidding lol’ when she’s not responsive 

- Using generic, boring questions: “What do you like to do for fun?” 

- Overuse of exclamation points

- Using emojis with every text

- Responding with disproportionate amount of text. (She sends a sentence, you reply with a paragraph)

- Overanalyzing meaningless things her texts. “She sent a kissy face emoji—she must like me!”

- Long-winded confessions of feelings or how special you think she is if she is unresponsive or goes cold.

- Saying ‘I miss you’ to someone you just met or just started dating

- Giving compliments too often, particularly on looks 

- Always initiating the conversation 

- Starting daily conversations with boring questions, “How are you?”

- Finally, the Jekyll and Hyde. Starts out complimentary, caring, until she doesn’t respond quickly enough, then it turns into insults, guilt tripping, or accusations of being strung along.",dating
351,potentially unpopular opinion about why dating apps are hard for men,"i think about this a lot and besides the obvious turn offs (misogyny, unfunny, etc,) men just miss the mark a lot of the time. let’s talk general statements for heterosexual, cis gendered relationships for a sec. women tend to put quite a bit of work into their profiles; they pick cute photos with outfits they’re proud of, put a cute bio in, and fill in all the blanks. on the flip side, a lot of men don’t necessarily put a lot of effort into their personal style. outside of dating apps they don’t necessarily care and it reflects on dating apps, as well. who doesn’t love a man who can dress and either keeps up with the trends OR wears clothing that are flattering. the same can be said with photos, there’s just not a lot of effort put in. sure, if you’re considered photogenic you can get away with more but men don’t really try to take photos that really show themselves off in a good way, and i don’t mean showing more skin. just selfies and group photos that are flattering. and lastly, sometimes the bios are dreadful. if you’re looking for a hookup, putting your university and height is standard i guess but what about that would make someone want to swipe on you? there’s a small window of time to catch someone’s attention, you have to consider that. 

i feel like the dating app game has also changed because of social media. that’s not to say looks are the only thing that matter but people need to figure out their target audience. i know the “type” of people who will not swipe on me and i have a pretty good gage on the people who will. similar interests is one thing but aesthetics matter to some people. and by aesthetics i absolutely don’t mean race, ethnicity, body type, etc. i’m talking style and how it appears someone holds themselves. especially when you’re meeting someone online and they can’t experience all you have to offer in person.  

personal care and confidence show, believe it or not. don’t settle for self deprecating jokes in your bio unless pity is what you’re trying to attract. be what you want to attract. you can have anyone you want so long as you embody the person who has that thing.",dating

She took a minute to show me how “bad” Tinder was going for her. 

It was ridiculous. She was getting 99+ likes, and had so many matches and messages that she just never read she and that’s going awful for her. That’s what a woman’s Tinder looks like when it’s bad.

I showed her mine and she was like, “well I’m only getting hook ups and not anything real so none of my matches mean anything”. That was like a slap. I’d give anything for one girl to want to sleep with me. I’m 21 years old and haven’t even been on a single date, and she’s complaining about getting sex.

355,CMV: Men get treated more harshly on same/similar actions than women.,"1. If a woman ghosts a man, people would say it is okay because she is concerned for her safety so ghosting is 100% okay even if the man in question never did anything wrong. While you are true that women are more statistically likely to be victims of violence, does it really absolve women in ALL cases of ghosting? Can we just accept that SOME women are just a-holes and have a convenient excuse to use so they dont seem like one? Jfc when the genders are reversed, you never see people telling the girl that she is being a creep. 
2. Women are allowed to expect a man to be for their meal even if they just met. But men cannot expect sex. While I think this might be a false equivalence since paying for a meal and letting someone else use your body is not the same, I feel like this social expectation allows some folks to take advantage of others. Nobody should have to pay for the date's meal when they just met for the first time period.
3. If a woman is being passive in texting, people will tell the man that it is because he is not interesting enough and he should put more effort. If a man is being passive, the women is told that it is not her fault and that she should just unmatch.

357,Why r/FemaleDatingStrategy/ give bad advice,"They are very focused on getting money and commitment and sure you could get that but will it really be someone you are attracted to? do you really need to sell your body for money? 

**You dont need his money**

Most women these days dont need males to give them resources, sure you can get that if you want but you dont really need that. Maybe you should instead focus on getting someone you are actually attracted to and that can satisfy you sexually. Do you want him to be the biological father of your children? 

**About sex without commitment**

You should have sex with an individual before committing to her or him, otherwise you dont know whether or not that aspect of a relationship will work. Unless you only want other things (such as money) you should have sex before marrying someone. 

I do believe that sexual activities with a partner will create a bond and this can explain why some individuals dont like being promiscuous, even if you are male you may not actually want to have sex with someone you clearly dont want as a long term girlfriend.",dating
358,"""Man must pay"" needs to die","*Inspired by* [*this recent post*](http://redd.it/rfne7f/) *, I want to* *~~voice~~* *rant my opinion on this separately, since it will just get lost among the many replies already there.*

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

Educated
Good family
Good character

Earns well - is not relying on my own income to contribute
Religious and practicing

But (and ofc there’s a but otherwise there’s no post), I’m not attracted to his photos at all. I don’t have a type tbh and actually as long as the person is fit and healthy and they have a banging personality, then that’s enough for me to be attracted to. 

We’ve spoken on the phone once and it was a really good convo, I liked his personality loads and felt we got on well. I’ve been in a similar situation before where I didn’t find the person attractive a few years ago and i just couldn’t go on with it. Now that person is engaged and I regret it incredibly. Im trying not to base my choice of off looks now cos it can be really misleading and it doesn’t mean the person will be good. 

I swiped and spoke to him because I feel I was a bit superficial, too. He earns very well and made that clear in his bio, and this is one of the biggest reasons for wanti to continue getting to know him. Don’t get me wrong I’m very ambitious and earn my own money, would want to continue doing so when I’m married but if he’s earning enough to cover us both well then I won’t have to worry about grinding so hard to earn.

362,Women who refuse to date bi men are insecure and/or homophobic,"I'm a bisexual man and have kept my bisexuality hidden from the majority of women I've dated, partly because I was struggling with self acceptance, but also because most have said they would not date a bisexual man when it's been casually brought up in conversation.

There are two main reasons that most women give when explaining why they wouldn't date a bi guy. The first one is that they believe he will be more likely to cheat, as there are more potential people he will be attracted to. Now, while I see the logic there, this is a fallacy. Cheaters cheat. Sexuality is irrelevant. This is akin to not dating a charming, good looking man just because he has more opportunity to cheat. But the main problem is that it is deeply rooted in the women's own insecurities/trust issues and a belief that she's not enough.

The second reason is that they find the idea of their man being with another man unattractive. Now, while many people would agree that this is just a preference (which we're all entitled to have), my argument is that it is an unhealthy preference, rooted in homophobia. If you are less attracted to a man purely because the idea of him being with another man turns you off, then I can't see how that is anything other than a deep-rooted, innate, subconcious homophobia. Which we have society to thank for!

363,News flash: just because someone is no longer into seeing you doesn’t mean they used you for a free dinner,"Tired of seeing males on here complain that they got used for a free dinner.  Here’s the possibility: she actually agreed on a date with you with no intentional deceit 🤯she genuinely was open to giving you a chance.  After you got your chance, she realized she’s just not into you.  Put your big boy pants on and accept that not everyone is going to like you.  Nobody owes you more dates or a relationship just because you spent money on them.  That’s what dating/courtship is.  Period! 

Disclaimer: regardless, I think ghosting is a crappy thing to do unless one’s life was in danger.  But getting ghosted by someone you spent dinner on is just cowardice on their part for not being able to explicitly say they’re not into seeing you anymore.  


FYI, in addition to seeing whiny males on here, I had a personal experience of being upfront and politely rejecting a guy after a couple dates because I didn’t feel the chemistry (I was taking a chance as he wasn’t someone I’m usually physically attracted to).  At the time, I was genuinely open to staying friends, so he asked if I’ll cover for him when we hang out as friends.

If you don't want to participate in having sex for fun, no one is going to force you. You also shouldn't be angry that people choose to make decisions that make them happy in life. Two people hooking up does not harm you in any way and whining about it doesn't solve your situation whatsoever.

Hard to believe that so many people want to quit dating. Many of whom are blaming some outside factor and also kinda are blaming women for how easy their experience is (which I would not only disagree with but actually claim that the opposite is true). Let me give you my perspective.

I am a below-average-looking guy. Not special in any way, studying computer science which isn't quite as attractive as medicine. Still, I'm doing just fine when it comes to dating. Obviously, I can't just go out with everyone I like and it does take more effort than for others but I'm doing really fine nonetheless.

There will be some unlucky guys who do everything right and still can't get laid but I highly doubt that this is the majority. Now you can downvote this post or insult me  but I'm not trying to shame anyone here. If anything I'm trying to give some of you guys hope by saying that you are the problem. Because if I'm right than you have the ability to change it. And I really believe that you can change and find someone great.

I really hope that all those posts are just some people venting. Please don't give up on dating it's fun, exciting and people are what makes life worth living.

There's nothing wrong about being a feminist either, but I've never seen many sane & confident MALE feminists. Or that's at least what I've experienced.

Oh, and so about the men shaming.. I've literally seen upvoted comments like ""older men approaching younger women is harassment"". 

Like wtf? Yes, most younger women won't go for an older man. But those men know that every once in a while they're going to find one that will luckily suck them off, hence why they keep approaching.

I'm in my early 20s and I have few female friends who love older dudes. The thing is, they don't like your average older dude. They want a better looking than the average older dude, which is fine. 

But just saying, shaming older men for trying to go for young women is just silly and you probably have some problem with yourself. Maybe not even those oldies want you. 

Besides, I never see people complaining about cougars hunting down younger men. 

You can pretty much ask any fit and attractive male that goes to gym about their experience with being approached by older women while they are busy with their fucking workouts.

And yet none of them feels offended, harassed nor do they want to call the cops lmao, even if they reject those women constantly.

Harassment is more like when a man or a woman doesn't take a ""no"" for an answer and keep bothering you. Write it down somewhere, it's important. Stop confusing it with normal daily human approach lol.

It seems some guys just don't try to set the mood for a date. They talk but they don't  try to get to know me as a person or reveal themselves more and build a connection. Then, they go out with other girls or just get disappointed and quit thinking ""this online dating thing doesn't work/ I felt no spark "". Ok, probably there wasn't much chemistry between me and those guys in the first place. But do they expect to meet a person and magically feel the sparks without putting any effort into it? I assume some guys will be immediately not attracted to me, which is fine, but I try to look pretty and friendly, so I hope it's not so often. I know we both should do our share in trying to build a connection. I could sometimes do more but I am a bit old school and prefer men to take the lead. I am also a bit quirky and lack confidence when dating but still I had a handful of guys interested in me and had deeper, interesting conversations with them. Also, not every guy is charming enough to make me push myself and  pretend to be a talk show host. Actually some of those guys who exhibit this behavior seem more like a nerdy type.

My most recent date frustrated me - we had 5 dates, all initiated by him so I was excited that he might like me. But there was no progress in our dating and I finally texted him ""this is not going anywhere"" to which he agreed saying it was fun although our conversations were not so great. On the last couple of dates I was thinking of things to ask him, mostly relating to relationships, and tried to find the right moment to ask them, but barely managed because they felt awkward in the existing conversation. And what did he ask me? He asked a lot about my work, my career aspirations, about the software we use at work, about my health insurance at work, comparing it to his own, even commented ""Your company pays well, doesn't it""? He talked about the apartments, buildings, about the neighborhood we both live in. Not a single time did he ask about my values, my relationship history and expectations, personality type, things that make me happy. He was polite but didn't tell me a single compliment or tried to hold hands or kiss. He got to know me on a quite superficial level, asking about the foods I like or things I do in my free time which is ok for a 1st date but not enough for a 5th. Honestly I was annoyed with him talking about work and money so perhaps I dodged a bullet here, which is a shame because he seemed like an attractive guy otherwise. 

Another guy I met once, he was a PhD, smart but probably not experienced in relationships. He just kept talking about his studies abroad, what the people abroad and the work in university were like. Closest he got to know me was asking about my hobbies.  Yes, it might be interesting to hear your stories, but we are just strangers after all.  And yet another guy, he wasn't really attractive, we just had a walk, no coffee or nice places, but he seemed like a decent, smart person, I just didn't feel like he cared. I wouldn't have been surprised if his friends told him to try Tinder and he was like ""ok, I'll try...wait, do I even need a girlfriend""?

Honestly, I have read on Reddit that some people consider a date ending with a kiss a successful one, well those dates of mine could not even come close to that....So how do you people make it? Do I just happen to meet too many guys with no chemistry? Whenever I'm interested in someone I google ""questions to ask during the date"" but they come off as random and forced...

**TL;DR:** some guys talk about impersonal things like work, money or other people without asking questions to get to know me as a person or giving me a chance to ask such questions and the dates feel more like a coffee break with a colleague rather than dates. Sometimes I rely too much on them leading the conversation or pursuing me and there is no attraction built, I get bored and no wonder we never talk and meet anymore. I want to meet fun guys but don't want to end up with those who are very flirty but are actually players.",dating
386,Are men scared of dating?,"I’m a 38f and I’ve been single 3 and a half years.  I’m not interested in getting into a serious relationship as my life is just too hectic already.  I get two weekends a month without my kids and in this time I need to fit in time with friends, time for me, and time to date, no relationship can develop in that sorry of time constraint so it’s pointless trying.

However, I’m still human.  I’m attractive, I don’t look my age, and I’m on dating apps to look for a FWB situation really. I’m honest, upfront about what I want? and I have good chat.  So I match, chat, explain the situation, and usually will decide a day to meet up for a drink when I’m free so we can take it from there.  Sounds easy right? I mean a lot of men would LOVE this right? A woman who wants sex with no commitment.

And yet, we will chat at most two weeks (depends when we matched as I usually arrange something for my next free weekend), then as the day gets closer, the chat gets quieter, they end up ghosting or cancelling last minute.  One actually told me ‘I’ve lost my nerve’ because he got a spot on his chin 🫤

You’re no doubt all going to come at me for being a woman and *shock horror* liking sex, or no doubt will tell me it’s my fault blah blah blah, and it’s the men I keep choosing (I actually don’t have a type tbh, you could t predict who I will match with next) but this happens all the time to my single friends too! The ones who want relationships and those who don’t.  

So men - are you scared? Or just enjoy giving it all the big talk then when it comes to it, too afraid to back it up with actions 🤷🏽‍♀️

EDIT:  

The men I talk to know are not being fooled, they know what I want, snd claim to want the same. I talk to them extensively 

Ive been on these apps 3 years and know exactly how to handle myself.  Any advice you give me, I already do. So thank you, but it’s not needed. 

I don’t actually date men my own age or older.  I already date younger so you don’t need to inbox me advise that with either.",dating

391,Convinced a fat girl she was hot so I could get laid- things backfired,"So I am 22M and a few weeks ago I started using Tinder to hook up with girls just to get laid. I was a virgin at the time and my goal was to get laid at least once since I was getting older. Luckily for me, I scored a ton of times in the course of 2 weeks.

So here is the infamous formula I invented that gave me a 85% win rate with getting laid:

Step 1: 
(the hardest/longest step)

Dm them some bs about how pretty they are. Ask what’s their favorite movie and then look up “best movie summary for [that movie]”

Reply to them and say “wow that’s my favorite movie too, because [sophisticated and intellectual reason why I like the movie based upon that googled summary].”

I’d then ask “what’s your Astro sign”

Whatever their reply was I’d say “ohhh nice, that specific zodiac means you must be fun to watch movies with” -sounds stupid but it works (for me at least)

I’d then weasel my way into convincing them to watch a movie together and then arrange a time that they’d come over.

Step 2: 
When they arrived at my place I’d bring them into my living room and I’d ask them a ton of questions about fun things they’ve done (travel, parties, sports, etc)

Step 3:
After about 10 minutes of chatting I ask if they wanted to “relax and watch a movie?” Most times they’d say “yes”. (Since that’s why they were coming over originally)

Step 4:
I’d then say “oh the TV is in my bedroom, if you don’t want to watch it in my bed I can try moving the TV into the living room?”, and almost every time they’d say it’s fine. (This was the whole purpose of the tv in the bedroom)-so I could pose that question

Step 5: I’d say “one sec I’m gonna grab a bottle of water real quick, you can head to the bedroom, it’s down the hall”. 
So while they started heading towards my room ”I’d turn the thermostat down so it was extremely cold. -this will be important later

Step 6:
Once we’re both sitting on the bed I put on the movie and we start watching.

Step 7:
I wait for the expected “WOW it’s cold”, of which I’d lie and tell them “the thermostat is broken and the temperature keeps changing but if you’re fine cuddling we can become a lot warmer.”

I guess all of them were expecting sex or something because they’d always say yes and then as we started snuggling we’d slowly start making out. And about 10-20 mins in we’d end up fucking..

Anyways, one of the girls who I brought over during that time was a chubby girl. After getting to step 7 we started making out and then she pulled away and asked “am I only here because you want to kiss me or are you actually interested in me?”

Me, the asshole I was at the time, made some bs up and convinced her she was extremely smart and funny and that “it was the sole reason I wanted her to come over”. I also went further and said that “the reason we were getting passionate was because of how pretty and attractive she was”. 

That statement led to me fucking her. 

After she left for the night she would text me non-stop asking if she could come over again because “nobody has ever made her feel special before like I did” and “she is deadly in love with me especially after what I said”

Fuck...

So I’d always lie and tell her “I’m so busy this week” or “my job is making me work extra hours” or some bs like that. 

—-

I’m pretty bad at explaining things so hopefully this entire thing made sense. For those who aren’t appalled or disgusted with me I need some advice of how to tell her no without hurting her. 

For those who genuinely hate me for this and think I’m an piece of shit, rest assured because karma already caught up with me! -every girl I scored with ended up ghosting me, I guess I’m bad at sex or something lol 

But anyways that disgusting 2 weeks of my life is over and the experience I had made me realize that I was seeing women through a misogynistic lens hence why I stopped trying to get laid once a day and am now trying to become a better person. Please help with this specific person though. I don’t want to play with people’s emotions to this scale and this one may be fragile.

Is there some secret level you need to be in terms of attractiveness to unlock the interest of slim average looking women, and I'm not just not up to that standard?  I'm around a 5/10. I'm middle ground. I feel a man needs to be a 7 to date a slim female 5.",dating

394,I have a girlfriend yet I still believe that the incels make many sound points.,"I am in love and I have a healthy sex life with a wonderful girl. However I believe that she belongs to the incredibly small amount of young women with traditional values. And what luck I'm 6ft 2. Let me describe this girl. She is a Christian who lost her virginity a year ago to a man with ED. at the age of 19. She dated exclusively older men and im her first similar age white man. She has had two experiences of full blown sex and one of them was the ED guy and now it's me. She believed herself to be asexual up until a few years ago. Weirdly enough she worked as a modal for a few times. She is a larger girl with an attractive face. I am a taller fat faced, secretly depressed, no ambition, blue color working, semi alcoholic loser by most measures. You know why I got this girl. Because of her values being similar to that of the women of the past. A time where men like me would find these girls and they would love us back because they weren't whoring around with Chad types who would never like them back because they devalued themselves for him. The previous generation had it better because they had better values. Looks like I got away lucky. Unfortunately my situation is rare.",dating

With this homosexual and social justice warrior world we live in, I am actually kind of relieved to know it isn't me. 

I mean what's the point? I treat women better than men, and now I am just going to treat women how I would treat another male. I am not going to waste so much energy into women who have mythological standards of what they want in a man. They want more and have black hole stomachs that are never satisfied.

396,Why are women so outraged when a guy asks them out?,"It's OK if you're not interested, just bloody say so. It's fine, we're all adults here and we all know the rules. You can just say ""oh, thanks for the offer, bit I'm not down for that"". Hell,  even make up an excuse and tell me your fake boyfriend wouldn't like that. It's cool. 

What I don't understand is why some women act like I've committed a crime against humanity for daring to ask them out. They get completely defensive, angry, embarrassed, or blow it up into some big deal. It's just a bloody offer for a drink or a chat. 

Is this the result of recent feminist movements convincing women that men are out to use and abuse them? It's getting frustrating. I think at least 40-50% of women I ask out act so childish and defensive over it, even though I took the courtesy of asking very politely/privately.

Honestly, there's nothing more attractive or admirable than a woman who rejects you maturely and continues to treat you like.a human being afterwards.",dating
397,People give guys bad dating advice.,"So, one thing that definitely needs to stop? The bad dating advice for men.

A lot of the things you will hear as a man are NOT dating advice:

\-Dress with good clothes

\-Hygiene

\-Be a better person. (This is actually the worst advice here, and I will explain later.)

None of this is dating advice, this is how to be a generally good person.

Three things people automatically think they are good at.

\-Sex

\-Fighting

\-Being a good person.

Funny thing is, most people aren't good at ANY of those things.

At the risk of breaking the rule on the general board, this needs to be said:

Disclaimer : I am not nor will I ever be affiliated with black pill / incel/ hate groups that see women as subhuman. Those groups do not represent my brand of evil, any accusations of me being with those groups will be met with blocking and or a remark that will probably hurt your ego for a few days  and then you will get over it, but then get triggered and remember it a few weeks later as it fades into your consciousness.

People see men as predators, and try to re-define sexual assault and rape around this idea they see the idea of logistics : Taking a girl to a bar that you know is in no way sexual assault. Getting her to come to your place for a drink is in no way sexual assault.

Now, is she drunk? Are you drunk? If you're both a little tipsy then all is fair, but this idea that men need to be given advice on how to be ""better people"" instead of actual dating advice is silly.

Most people are not good people, most people are assholes. This applies to women as well. So, why would you assume that guys need to become ""better people"" when the other half is not becoming better? 

Another thing? Becoming a better person actually turns girls off. A friend of mine has a dating problem : He gets numbers, he gets kisses, but girls seem to just run away from him when he makes a mistake. He's not a bad guy, not creepy, not rude, mean and he isn't doing anything wrong by any metric. The thing is, he's a good looking 6""2 black man and he works out every day. (No seriously. . . I don't know how he does it.) From a woman's perspective, either he is a pua who is going to break their hearts or he is going to go berserk and kill them.

Not to mention, he's not the first good guy to have a problem dating girls. If you go through good man syndrome, you're going to have trouble getting girls because they will feel insecure around you. 

Which is why urging a man to become a better person before he dates is awful. 

It's just going to ensure he doesn't get a date.

We're here to date and or fuck, people. We don't need to be pseudo-life coaches. 

Here is some legit dating advice for a guy :

\-Learn body language to see if she is into you or not.

\-Learn how to manage your emotions so null text replies don't bother you.

\-Approach more girls.

\-Make your approach fit to your personality

\-Don't be a nuisance.

\-Learn to take no for an answer.

\-Roll your sleeves up.

\-Know how to deal with her tests

\-Wear grey sweatpants.

\-Be the leader in the interaction, because most girls are still traditional.

\-do not lower your standards, EVER. That will only make her lose respect for you and end up boosting her ego at your expense.

\-Pay attention to how your torso feels when you have been around her. If it's good, then you are experiencing ""good vibrations"" but if its bad and making you feel anxious, you are experiencing ""bad vibrations"" and know she isn't into you and its time to go.

\-You don't HAVE to ask every girl you find attractive out, there is a way through an obstacle, and a way around. Are you the strongest, sexiest, and smartest version of yourself? No? Then feel free to just leave.

\-Recognize when you are burnt out.

Dating. Is. Hard. It is harder than Dark Souls, it is harder than gaming and you are either winning or you're not. If you're not winning and you're tired of not winning, take a break. We don't need less stress in our lives, we need superior rest. This principle applies to all things.

Alright, great talk.

You're welcome.",dating
398,Why are men held to far higher standards in online dating and dating in general?,"I've noticed that men get held to far higher standards than women in all forms of dating. Some examples of this are as follows:

&#x200B;

\- men must use great pictures in their dating profiles. Great quality, great lighting, great backdrop, showing them doing interesting things, some photos with people (to show they're sociable), preferably with animals to show they can care for something. Women can use any low quality, poorly taken photo and no one is bothered. They still get dates.

\- men have to work out and be in shape. Being fat or skinny as a man is a virtual death sentence in the dating world. Women can be any size, any shape, don't even need to exercise or have a gym membership, they can get dates.

\- men must have great fashion sense. They must dress really well, with perfect fit clothes in the correct colours. And they must be well groomed. Women can wear anything they want, they still get dates.

\- men must be in a job or studying. They must be earning money or at least working towards something. Women can be unemployed, no ambition and eat pizza all day and still get dates.

\- men must have their own place. Living with parents is a disaster (trust me, I admitted this to women before in the past and they stopped talking to me soon after). Women can live with parents and still get dates.

\- men must have a plethora of interesting hobbies they do. I've been told I must have interesting hobbies like sky diving, rock climbing, sailing, hiking, writing novels, making films etc. all just to get dates with a few women. Meanwhile women can do nothing and still get dates.

\- men must have a great ""attitude"". They must be extremely positive, not in any way bitter or jaded or negative. If they fail to get dates, it must be their poor ""attitude"" that stops them. Women can have any attitude they desire, they can treat men as badly as they want, and they still get dates.

For example, “i am still at work, ill respond to you in a bit” or they send me good morning texts every day!!!

I personally don’t care to get these updates because we are simply talking as friends right now and getting to know each other. I can go days or weeks without speaking its fine with me.

400,is this a form of rape? what is this called and am i at fault??,"so a situation happened to me months ago but i cant stop thinking about it bc idk why it happened and what it would be considered. so i (23F) was receiving a back massage from a fwb (23M) bc who doesn't love a free back massage. well he quickly got horny (which annoyed me bc i didnt wanna do anything sexual at all and i realized the back massage was probably just a segue for him into sex which made me sad bc i thought he was just being nice but that's besides the point). he started touching my butt and things which i didnt mind but then he started grinding against me and i let him know i didnt want to do anything and he was find with that. but i let him do whatever, i was just on my phone. eventually he had put a penetrative sex toy in between my legs, basically in my crotch and he was fucking it and i realized that i really hated what was happening. i felt like i was being used. and the whole time this was going on i was literally just laying there on my tummy on my phone paying 0 attention to what was going on bc i wasnt in the mood at all. and i felt used and gross and dirty even tho he didnt technically do anything to me/with me. 

and part of my issue is that i didnt leave. i couldve just gotten up and left but i didnt, i think i just shut down or something. or i think part of me wouldve felt bad leaving bc i felt like my being there was helping him get off and maybe im too nice of a person. which sounds insane, i know. but why didnt i leave. am i at fault for not leaving. did anything bad or wrong actually happen here?? im just kind of confused by the whole thing i guess

EDIT: some people are arguing about the definition of rape vs sexual assault so I wanted to add my own thoughts. personally I do not think this was rape.

402,"How should I go about having the ""dealbreakers"" discussion?","I know I shouldn't talk about them too soon, but eventually these things need to be discussed. What I've worried about is: stating my dealbreaker(s), and then a girl realizes she violates the dealbreaker(s), and then she nopes out. That's happened twice already, and those two times it's been roughly on the second date. I don't even think I was being too harsh. Example: I was getting hot and heavy with a girl and I noticed she let me touch her anywhere, but she wouldn't touch me below the belt. This had already happened on 3 separate occasions with her. When I asked her why, she said she doesn't really feel comfortable touching or performing oral on a guy in general. And then I looked at her and said ""okay that's not cool, if a girl can't do that then it's probably not going to work"". She then put on her coat and started to leave.

And if they want to just have sex, why don’t they just say that without the “but things might develop later” bit?

409,Is there anything wrong with rejecting overweight people?,"Imo it's fine to reject people on the basis of weight, it doesn't make you shallow or a bad person. It's wrong to reject people based off skin color, race, eye color, hair color etc. because those are not things a person can control and those kinds of differences should be celebrated.

But everyone can control their weight and stay in shape if they want to. Don't get me wrong, not everybody has the genetics to obtain a six-pack no matter how much they work out in a healthy way. But everybody can at least remain slim and fit with enough effort, it all comes down to calorie intake and exercise. No one is above the laws of physics. And in shape people are objectively more attractive, it's just biology. 

At the end of the day, being overweight is unhealthy, limits what you can do and can lead to all sorts of complications as you get older. So it's fine to have standards and not want someone like that in your life especially when it's something they can easily fix.",dating

415,"Am I the asshole because I (32/f/ASD/never married and no kids) REFUSE to ever date men with kids, divorced, or who are also autistic like me?","I'm 32 years old. I am independent, go to the beat of my own drum, and I am autistic. The only relationship that I ever had was a seven year relationship. We dated from 2009-2016, the relationship was very abusive & I ended up suffering badly because of it. However, slowly and surely I am slowly healing but I am focused on self love. I work as an ECE Assistant and don't get me wrong, I love kids or I wouldn't be in the profession. However, handling a man's child(ren) is something that I just can't do. Also, with the field of work I'm in, it would be like being at work all the time. I also know where to draw ny boundaries and I know my limits of what I need, want and won't be able to handle.

416,"Women I date all seem to fall quickly in love with me. My female friends (32F, 34F & 33F) have told me it's because I'm one of the few naturally good guys out there. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but I just want some casual relationships and I'm breaking these women's hearts too often now.","While this sounds like a humble brag, and I guess it is, but it's also becoming a real problem.

Women fall in love with me easily. Ever since I've been 11, I've often dated the prettiest girls in HS, College etc.

My natural 'goto' game from since then is befriend them, get to know and understand them emotionally. Other than that I show no overt signs of interest, but I do subtly flirt and tease them a lot. I grew up with several girl cousins so conversing and understanding women was easy. I was the youngest boy with 7 similar or slightly older female cousins and I learned quickly how to get them on my side as well as how to really know them.

Whatever I'm doing has worked brilliantly throughout my dating life.

However, I maried my college sweet heart (34F) and at 35m I'm now divorced (2.5 years now). It's no fault of her or me, we just sort of grew apart. My ex-wife is one of my best friends now and she always tells me I'm easy to fall in love with.

I've got 2 other close female friends who I've dated in the past and one I'm FWB. I've known them for over 10 years so we have a very open relationship and understanding.

So back to the topic, for the last 2 years I've been dating and maybe 7 out of 10 women I date, no matter their age, quickly fall in love with me. I so often hear them say they're coming off tinder or bumble because they wanan settle down with me. I don't mind, but unles I'm really inlove with them I feel guilty.

I feel as if they're far more invested emotionally than I am. I end up feeling quite bad like I'm using them and then inevitably I had to break up with them after the first 3-7 dates.

I spent sometime chilling with my guy friends who I haven't seen in months due to the covid (also I moved). And I quickly realize my probelm was quite unique.

All of them had trouble getting 2nd dates, all of them would kill for some of the women I broke up with (they were all very attractive) and they all thought I was some player or stud.

Truthfully, there's not much separating me from them.

I'm well off yes, I make well over $100k, got a nice apartment and car. But many times women don't know that untill long after they're 'inlove'.

I am fairly goodlooking and I have been told i look like Chris Evans a lot. I'm fit, dress well. But there's tonnes of other goodlooking me out there.

So last night I asked my two female best friends what is it that I'm doing 'right'.

They both gave their perpsectives.

Alice said - You're kinda the whole package, and if you slept with them they'd also know you're good in bed. But it's not that, there's something about your tone or your eyes that makes me feel like i trust you. Most guys give off creeper vibes or seem like they're secretly not telling you what they mean because they just wanna sleep with you. What I love about you is that if you don't agree with me, you tell me and do it in the nicest way. You're also funny AF as well because you find humour in most situations. Also, it's cute becauase you're supposed to be the super smart succcessful guy, yet you say the dumbest things sometimes.

Chrissy said - I don't know I can't explain why I like you, I just connect with you more than other men. But it's also because I feel safe with you. I feel like I know what you're thinking. Like you're my safe escape from reality, someone I can be me with.

All good so far doesn't it seem so?

I'd never change this quality about myself, but I kinda want to stop breaking hearts and just keep things casual without having them fall in love with me.

I have this with Chrissy, we are FWB and it's what I need but she lives almost 2 hours away so I don't see her more than once or twice a month.

Any advice on what I should be doing? If I tell women on our first dates that I want to keep it casual does that signal a red flag? I don't want to turn them off obviously, but I don't want to get committed too quickly and then hurt them.

It does feel bad, especially when I don't feel the same.",dating
417,Dating is a guy is exhausting because you have to use fakery and lies even if you don't want to,"I just read a comment on here and it's summed up exactly how I feel but I can't find it at the moment

Basically the guy said that as a man it gets so exhausting because you know you have to not only compete with other men but also put on this act to entertain and perform and provide even if you don't have it and even if you don't want to


The only reason I think I have had so much success so far is because I am 6'6 and conventionally attractive

I am proud of my personality and a lot of women have said that but it does make me wonder if I was short and white and have the same personality if I would have the same success


Something I noticed growing up is specially after hitting puberty was dead other men feel very threatened by me and will try to cut me down and a lot of women would assume I would hit on them.

Looking back it was clear that some of these girls obviously like me but because I was the guy they expected me to perform or impress them in some way and that was never my personality


Contrary to popular belief most men know exactly how most women feel when it comes to dating and that's probably why so many men have it hard because they haven't practiced, and that is because so many women make it clear just how many creeps and monsters they meet


No man wants to be a woman's story about her daily creeper monster and no man wants to be her story about a guy who was pathetic or couldn't keep her going


I honestly do not believe that women or anybody can truly sense someone's levels of social skills or confidence because if that was true then I would have failed so many times but I've gotten by off of charisma and just being socially savvy enough

But it's harder with women because I know how the game is but you do not want to use these type of tactics or be fake when you're trying to form a genuine connection

And get the biggest risk of dating is that you have to be vulnerable and take a leap of faith and sometimes they can leave you with more damage than good


I dated a girl who obviously wanted to have sex but she wanted me to make it happen and it's crazy because she said she wanted to wait

I was completely cool with this and society would judge me negatively if I had any qualms about her reservations but looking back at it, of course socially and verbally she was going to be adverse to sex but because I was the man she wanted me to make it happen because that's the type of man she was attracted to


Everything I was brought up by society and my own family became backward


A lot of women say the dating is dangerous and can be a waste of time because of how many dead in partners that they find but I would argue it's the opposite for men because on our dates we have to act extra careful not to be too overconfident but not to sad or sensitive either and it just gets exhausting because you never know how much you need to be.



I cringe everyday looking back at high school because if I would have stopped acting so politically correct then I probably could have gotten a girlfriend

418,"Do nice guys exist? And if so, how do I find them?","Ok, so I am a single, 23F. I guess I’m what you’d call a “nice girl”. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t have casual sex, I’ve never done dr**s, I don’t swear/curse, I volunteer at an animal shelter, I’ve got a masters degree and I love my friends, pets and family. My hobbies include running, reading and scrapbooking. 

I just finished my degree and am currently working part-time at a bar, while I search for graduate jobs/internships. Working at a bar has made me so depressed and hopeless on the dating front. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the men I meet are not very nice. I see hundreds of men a day who are cheating on their girlfriends, doing drugs, DUI, acting inappropriately towards me, being perverts and offering me money for s*x! Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I’ve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I’m serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

The other barmaids say they are just “used to it now” and it’s just “lad culture, so don’t take it personally.” But it is scary to me and really unattractive! It’s really made me believe there are no decent men out there and I feel so hopeless. My ex of 4 years also cheated on me and left me for another girl, which I guess hasn’t helped my opinion. 

I just want to know, are there any nice guys left out there and if there are, where/how do I find them? Thanks!",dating
419,Attractive female being forward/blunt,"I liked this guy and I waited for him (2 years) to approach or text or reply to a snap even but he started drinking heavily (on snap) and he started having fake girls on insta (he didn’t before) and I had to move on. I called him (we don’t normally talk) and told him how much I liked him, how he was so much better than his drinking, how he was soo smart and way better than the insta girls. He just listened the whole time, barely said a word. Because of his lack of response I deleted him off snap. 

The next day I noticed he changed his insta name (people change their insta names so that people can’t find them) and removed those girls. 2 months later, I was talking to a friend who knew the story and she said ever since I called him, she never saw him drink again. (She’s close to the situation/friend group)

he does not want to be my friend (I tried again a few months later). I literally embarrassed myself at how hard I tried. Before you say that a female shouldn’t chase, I balance bluntness with femininity very well. Men find me attractive and I have a great personality. 

My question is, Why would he even value my opinion enough to change himself but wouldn’t give me a chance. Not even friends? 

If I was doing something and someone calls me out on it, I would get upset “who do you think you are” attitude unless I value them. I think that’s the majority of people’s psychology. 

Also there’s a LOT more to the story but this is just a snip. The fact that I found the male version of me is dangerous and this is what caused the intense attraction on my end.",dating

421,"My boyfriend seemed like a mature, intelligent guy but he's actually a big man-child.","I met my boyfriend online and in my bio, i wrote that i like mature, intelligent guys. He messaged me, we met up.

When i met him, i saw this guy sitting at a table, wearing a cardigan sweater and slacks, reading War and Peace and drinking some fancy wine, but his eyes weren't moving, just staring at the center. He talked intelligently, like he sounded like he knew what he was talking about, every random question i asked, he knew the answer to. He seemed well versed on political issues, knew the answers to some quiz show i listened to on the radio.

When we got to his house, right by the door was the remote to the stereo, he turned it straight to classical music. His room though, the walls were completely blank. No pictures or anything. But I was thinking i finally found who i was looking for. So...i slept with him. Right away. Afterwards, i hung around for awhile, we watched Jeopardy! and he got most of the question's right. He told me he just reads a lot.

But actually? It seems like an act. The reason the walls were blank was because he took his poster's down, the wall's used to be covered in posters. I know because they were put back up after i left, and i surprise visited him. It was, like, kid's cartoons and anime. I asked about it, he said he's both, a smart guy and a kid at heart. And that he surpressed his childish side because he ""Thought i'd judge him"". But now that we started dating that side came out. He's actually into really childish humor. He thinks Beavis and Butt-Head and Austin Powers are the most hilarious thing ever and kept quoting it at me. He'd greet me with ""What's up, Fart knocker?"" and ""Hey Baby. Do i make you Horny? Randy?"". I cringe laughed at him. Instead of reading War and Peace, he reads manga. Instead of wine, he actually drinks chocolate milk. His closet has one nice shirt and a bunch of graphic t-shirts.

So, i guess the whole mature sophisticated gentleman routine was a front. He's actually a man-child. He basically tricked me, should i continue the relationship or not? Maybe it wasn't just an act. Cause he does seem genuinely intelligent, but was that an act too? I don't really know what to do, actually. Cause i was attracted to the mature intelligent front he put up, but that side doesn't come up much.",dating
422,"Be more positive, people (especially men)","I've seen a lot of negativity trolling this board lately.

In short: be more positive.  If you feel bad about the way you look, problem solve.  If you're fat, walk regularly.  Work up toward running.  You can go from being 60lbs overweight to running 3mi a few times a week.  Next, hygiene.  Do you wash your face daily?  Do you use some kind of base body spray?  You can mess around with other stuff like oils (literally I make sure to smell like vanilla).  Do you use product in your hair?  Next, accessories.  I'm pretty simple, but it's not hard to go on Amazon and spend $5 on some bracelets.  Some dudes like rings, some go for chains.  However you dress, it'll attract some different type of person.

Next, build a respectable social life.  It's not hard.  Get involved in activities: exercise, sports, art, adventures, travel, learning, crafting.  If you live outside a city, sad to say but a city offers you a whole lot more.

If you're doing all of that stuff, really I mean it's not as hopeless as I am seeing on Reddit.  I feel so bad dealing with rejection but it seems like (more than a lot of people on Reddit) I bounce back because I do a lot of self-care.  It's not hard for me to look at my dream girl on social media and figure out she's with some guy who doesn't seem as attractive as me or have the same success.  This is about where I'm at in my own journey, but it takes a lot of experimenting.  Learn what you really want.  Be in a position in life where emotionally you want someone to spend your time with hanging out indoors (in bed, on the couch, cooking) or going out with (dinner dates, social groups, staycations, vacations, family holidays).  Be in a position financially where you reasonably work 40 hours a week and don't take work home with you.  Be in a position where you're not planning on making any major work life changes.

For myself, I've been at the dating thing quite a while and I have a rather remarkable set of stories to share about all this work I've put in to my life.  A lot of people get into this mode of oversharing on social media without any real substance.  It seems like many more people get into the throes of life and don't remember to come up for air.  Just remember that when you're ""ready"" you're at the top of your game.  You're at your best for work / your physical self / you know yourself.  There are so many other people who are working through these items or they're unhappy in a relationship.

This is obviously for the people who have it all together and are just missing the spark with the other person.  It's not meant to discourage people still needing to do the self-work.  It's for people who ""know"" they're ""ready"".

For me, I had a few cruddy dates and my exes verbal abuse had floated through my head.  I moved to a city recently and went out a couple of times embarrassing myself.  I had one or two failed starts with what could have turned into something.  These were situations where I put my most positive self forward and it just didn't connect.  Some of this post is a projection for myself that really when you've got your !@#$ together, it's just a matter of not letting others pull you down.. and then it's just a numbers game to keep trying because it will work.

For the guys, I get that the dating apps are totally crummy.  However, if you put effort into showcasing your life through photo's (it's not *that* hard, most phones have great cameras nowadays), you can do quite well on apps.  Most people understand the importance of a good action shot and at least I try to make people laugh and be their best selves when I take a photo of them (even if it's not accurate, people are truly grateful for a good social media moment or captured memory).  Some apps are better than others.  I don't think relying on apps to source your next romance is a great idea, but just like with social media ignoring it likewise doesn't make total sense.  That's just part of being alive nowadays, so even though it could be a lot better we're all sort of stuck ""figuring it out"" for now.

For the guys, just know that five or twenty five women might reject you, give you RBF, or just be outright rude or mean to you.  Only one of those twenty five women matter and that one person wants to talk to you. Grow some thick skin about it, because the apps may have turned people into a commodity but women have always felt this way.. and the rules still are that -- like with a dancefloor -- you effectively do all of the initiating and leading.  Most women these days work, sure, and in that regard a lot of women worth your time will pay their share through the relationship.  Some even may be stuck trying to invent their new world order version of a relationship where the woman leads, but really that simply is not most women.  It's not really that monumentally different from how things used to be.

That's all I got.  Keeping positive is all you can do.  Everyone has bad days or weeks (or years even).  If you're feeling good just do your best to avoid those people and roll with the punches.",dating
423,"Guys. Dodge the ""I'm looking for a relationship,"" type like the Matrix.","Why?  **Because they're not looking for any type of relationship with anyone.

If this is conveyed at the first date, then ***do not buy it or entertain it.***

**Dating is EXTREMELY easy. You meet.  You click.  You make something happen**. So fuck all the game playing, the PUA advice about being mysterious and aloof. Scarcity creates value, yes, but not when you first start dating someone.  It actually has the adverse effect.  Ask yourself.  \*Has misdirection led to anything sustainable long term?\*It's much easier for women to attract the attention of a man, even more so on OLD.  If she's been single or on a app for an extended period of time without having her relationship goals met, then **she's purposefully made dating hard for herself** by chasing bums, being conflict averse, uncooperative, having controlling tendencies, attention whore, or having low self esteem. None of which, have anything to do with you.  And keep it that way.

Toxic women. Entitled women. Meaningless hookups. Personality void women. Junkie trash. Gold diggers. Manipulators. Sexually dead women. You name it's I've dated or fucked it.


I know some of you guys having a hard time out there are genuinely looking for someone special to spend your time with. Just a heads up. You're going to be waiting a long time

This is coming from someone who would genuinely love to meet somebody, but is always unsatisfied with his experiences.


I've finally have gotten to the point where I realized sitting back and watching your friends lives get destroyed is a much better place to be. I used to get irritated by how unsatisfying my relationships have been. 


But I got sick of walking on eggshells, and for what? 

Seriously ask yourself that question. What do women today actually have to offer to compliment your life besides just some pussy? What do they actually bring to the table on a emotionally satisfying level? 

Stop chasing and wait til you meet the right one. Stop breaking yourselves for women who aren't worth that much and enjoy the lack of toxicity. Don't be frustrated, you aren't missing out on much. Especially you young guys struggling over there. There is nothing wrong with you. You're just looking for a unicorn in the barn. Live it up and relax.

It's just something I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. I see a lot of these guys who have nothing going for them.

They're not educated, they speak like idiots, they start fights with other guys, they're like 20-30 and they don't have any future goals. Most just work shitty jobs and have no plans for a future.

Like what box do they check off? If I shoot steroids up my butt and act like loud and obnoxious, will I have the same chances as these guys with women?

Is intelligence, creativity, ambition, maturity all boring now? 

A lot of people might say it's confidence but to me it does not seem like a genuine confidence. Somebody who talks loud/obnoxiously, sags his pants, and starts fights with people is not a genuinely confident person.

It is unfair to the people you date and yourself when your mental health causes problems. I've been ghosted by two guys who said they were struggling with their mental health. The first time it was only a couple dates but I was worried so no big deal, his health comes first. He started ghosting me and i confronted him, at which point he told me. The second guy started ghosting me and I confronted him, no response for a couple days. He finally told me, I replied, and still no reply. Even when you're struggling, ghosting is the worst route to break things off with somebody for you and for them. My own mental health has been shit because i dont know what to think when this happens.

I struggle with depression and anxiety but when I break things off, I always do it with decency and  give them the reason, no games no bullshit. But now I'm just going to assume when a guy says they're struggling with their mental health its just a fake reason and they're too chicken, unless they give me a reason to believe otherwise. Just be straight up and honest.

edit: people just keep making assumptions that im saying people with mental illnesses do not deserve to date/find love. NO. that is not my point, im saying prioritize healing yourself before dating because 1) can't love others if  you don't love yourself 2)it hurts more people. and yeah mental illnesses are unpredictable but you can work to get yourself to a point where you can communicate what you're going through to your loved ones instead of dipping out!!

edit 2: okay obviously everybody and their experiences are different. my point is get yourself to the point where you can communicate with your loved ones instead of acting shitty and disappearing before pursuing others and eventually hurting them. mental health isn't a one size fits all, everybody suffers differently. but like i said this post is my opinion!!!! based from my experiences!!! with my own mental illnesses!!!! and guys who've treated me shitty bc of their illnesses !!! the title is honestly a clickbait in hindsight ",dating

434,Farmers Only Dating; Did I just accidentally ruin a good thing over politics?,"tl;dr: I, a city girl, met a farmer online. Got along AMAZING, until I shared my political beliefs.  It seems like it has impacted our budding relationship for him, but he won’t say that.  And now I am wondering how much I should push him for an honest answer or if should just move on and not disclose my politics (less than 2 months in?)to anyone else I date in the rural community?


I (33F)work for a big corporate company based out of a large metro area that does a lot of work in rural communities, and in the last 6 months have spent the majority of my time in small towns throughout the Great Plains on work business.  I was still trying to date very casually, but doing so in my city was almost impossible given all the travel I was doing.  One of my friends suggested Farmers Only and I realized that actually might be a good idea.

I downloaded it and ended up meeting a man (41M) in the area I would be primarily working in for the next few months.  Since I was still a couple weeks from my first trip, I kept it online and fun.

I was actually surprised at how well we got along despite our different backgrounds, and found myself looking forward to his photos of his massive farm, his daily shenanigans, and his work.  He is also really funny, pretty hot and handsome, and was pretty honest about his life.

The ONLY thing that stood out to me was the potential political differences.  Based on comments made or stories he told (and a little stereotyping), I could tell he was Republican or Libertarian.  Which was fine, for me, as that isn’t unheard of in small town America and I am pretty politically open.

But after we had multiple dates in-person, and talked for weeks non-stop the topic of guns came up and how I had never held a gun.  He jokingly wondered why and then offered to show me. I didn’t want to dance around the topic,  I really liked him, so I took the plunge and shared that I was pretty liberal. No commentary on any issues, political elections, historical things, I current issues.  I just shared that I fell more liberal on the spectrum. He looked somewhat surprised.

Now, I have NEVER hidden anything from him.  He knew I came from a big city, what my background was, education, job, interests, and my opinions on other social topics, etc. We had just never explicitly talked politics.

When I told him he looked surprised, he laughed and said no, and that he had his suspicions. But that he was surprised that I knew so much about “his world” and had a “country feel” to me.  That made me happy to hear and we wrapped up our date and went home.

But, then nothing.  He usually texts me something before bed, and then in the middle of the night (aka when he wakes up for work), and then sends me photos of daily happenings.  And they all just… petered out.  

I am really, really sad, because I *really*  liked him and I thought he really liked me.

Eventually, I did ask him directly if something was wrong, and even point blank asked if it was our political conversation, and he has denied it and said he has just been busy during the day and really tired at night.  And he hasn’t been unkind or mean in his responses whatsoever.

But, we haven’t been together in a few days (which is unusual) and have since talked less than we would talk in a single morning.  I don’t want to push, because he could really be overworked and really tired and I certainly don’t want to smother him. But I think it really was the politics thing.

And so, now I’m at a loss of what to do.  I don’t want to keep pestering him (if that’s what my check-ins and cute texts are now), but I also don’t want to assume that we’re done (because dating in this small of a county would be awkward). I also don’t want to be the one to an introduce a “closure” conversation, because I ultimately do not want that.

Also, is this a lesson moving forward?  Should I hide my political beliefs if I continue dating like this? I have no ill will or judgement on anyone else or their political beliefs, but I don’t want to hide who I am to these wonderful men I do meet.

Any help or feedback (especially if you’re dating in rural America), would be appreciated!",dating

436,Lying to my boyfriend about NOT being a virgin?,"I'm 20f and met this guy 21m 4 months ago. He has plenty of sexual experience. At 20, I never felt insecure about my virginity but quickly found out that people judged me harshly for it, made fun of me, and guys got creepy about it. So I lied and said to my now boyfriend at the start that I wasn't a virgin and lost it at 17. I never made any other story about it, just said I lost it at 17 to 'a guy,' it would be weird/messed up to add any more detail.

The thing is, our relationship started off casual so I never felt the need to tell him, but now we're in a relationship I don't want to start it off on a lie. However, I don't feel comfortable telling him (at least not yet) because I'm afraid of the judgement, plus he consistently calls me 'adorable,' and 'innocent.' He means no harm by it, but I also always feel like a little girl with him, and it's only going to get worse when I tell him. Should I just come clean? :/",dating

438,Is it wrong to call off a relationship due to gap in sexual experience?,"TLDR; Would I be in the wrong for ending a relationship very early on because he’s inexperienced sexually?

I (23F) have been seeing someone (21M) for about a month now, though we’ve been familiar with each other for several months. We haven’t had the labeling conversation yet and it’s still very early on, but he’s introduced me to his friends and we talk pretty regularly. I think he really likes me and I like him. He’s by far the kindest and most considerate person I’ve dated and my ideal long-term partner has so many qualities that I see in him. The only issue so far is his lack of sexual experience. It turns out I was his first kiss, which shocked me because I have been in a couple serious relationships already and have a lot of sexual experience in and out of those relationships. I am very familiar with myself and know what I want with a sexual partner. So this was alarming to me because suddenly I feel like I’m in a position of power over him, especially because he’s a little younger, and that I will have to teach him a lot if I want this to keep going. And I’m also extra nervous about crossing boundaries or accidentally pushing him outside of his comfort zone. I have never called off a relationship so preemptively like this and I’m afraid I would be doing it for a non-reason, when I should instead be focusing on all the things I like about him. However, if things progressed physically I know that I’m not comfortable being in such a position of power like that. Would it be wrong for me to call it off so soon when he’s genuinely done nothing wrong? And if I do, how do I make sure I’m gentle about it and don’t accidentally shame him for having a lack of experience?",dating
439,Met my destiny but friendzoned,"I met a girl who is a psychologist a few days ago and instantly hit it off. It felt like meeting her and being with her is my destiny.

&#x200B;

We flirted a bit over WhatsApp and she enjoyed my compliments. She said her ex made her feel bad about herself. 

I asked her thoughts on marriage and she did marriage is not for her.

&#x200B;

We met a week later and I gave her a red rose. She instantly said - ""You shouldn't have"" and I realized it was a blunder.

Later on, while talking, we found we have so much in common. 

&#x200B;

The next day after we meet, I flirted with her and she kinda enjoyed it. But suddenly there was a change in her tone. When I said I would love to spend my life with her, she said she was commitment-phobic and interested in me just as a friend.

Based on the conversation, a small red flag which I noticed was that her parents were not looking for any suitable groom for her, which is surprising considering she's extremely beautiful and well-educated. She has resigned herself to living as a lonely girl and said her parents considered her their retirement plan. Her younger sister is married and she told me her sister gets all the compliments. 

&#x200B;

The 2 of us have many common interests and qualities. 

&#x200B;

I am really interested in her and would like to grow old with her. What should I do?

&#x200B;

1. Just be with her as a friend for a couple of months and see if she gets to like me? 

2. How long should I try?

3. Furthermore, she said she's commitment-phobic. Would being in a relationship with a commitment-phobic lead to a happy life? I don't know a lot about this phobia.

4. Is she just being an attention seeker for compliments?",dating

Met his friends (just a coincidence) it was all wonderful. He said validating things of us having a future, I did as well. While in bed and kissing he said I should come to his city (this may have been an in the moment thing to say).

When I get home the next morning (no we didn’t have sex, but I did stay the night) I tell him I had a great time. He texts me back the next day and apologizes for the late reply he had been out with the friends I met the night before. They went to a college game and probably just hung out all day drinking and stuff.

I heart the message which isn’t abnormal. Then I ask if he saw our friend at the game. A guy we met the night before said he was going. He didn’t reply. Two days go by and I’m antsy so I send “hey I’m blunt, will I see you again” he finally replies “yes you will” I say “ok sounds good”. Over a week goes by and he texts me “Want to bend you over my lap and spank you rn” so random. I didn’t reply bc fuck you for texting me that. 

Over a week goes by he still watches my stories. I also watch his. His college (we are both graduated) beat my team and he posted the score saying wow and I send a gif that’s of a sad fan with thumbs down. He opens like 10 minutes after I send and doesn’t laugh or reply. You think he didn’t reply because he’s salty? Idk why he still follows me. Him and his best friends girlfriend follow me.

A couple of months ago when he saw me talking to another guy (his coworker) he came over to where we were and interrupted our conversation. He overheard this guy name Rick (his coworker) telling me that he had done something fun. And then he came over and stood between us saying (how was it?) I don't know why he would do this.

444,Virgins tho,"People. Just coz she’s waiting for marriage and/or is a virgin, it’s not that bad. Be strong. Patience gets rewarded. At least TRY to get to know her if what you want in life is a fulfilling relationship. I know, bla bla bla, sexual chemistry is so important and compatibility and we want it anyways. But if you really are fully in love and considerate, couldn’t you work with it? As long as you’re honest and work together to make it amazing, open to trying new things, understanding of no’s and being ok with those lines staying there forever should they come up, etc. Have those talks in detail before hand anyways. Those talks will reveal a lot of sexual compatibility that sex could be a deal breaker or not (aside from the fit). I don’t blame you, way more fun that way. And ok even if you disagree with that CONSIDER that not all of us are clueless about sex, some of us are very sexual, know what we want, and I mean I’ve waited over 20 years to have sex… trust me when I tell you it will be worth the wait. Like an animal breaking free from its cage. All that sexual tension released for you. Especially if we build that emotional bond too. Hon I will surprise you.  

Just if she says she wants to wait however long work with her to wait that long. You will only turn her on more by helping her achieve that and respecting her wishes. 

Just an unpopular opinion (:
For those of you completely not for it, alrighty enjoy the sex for me :p

Edit: I’m surprised by how many people who’ve had sex think all virgins have ZERO knowledge of likes, dislikes, kinks, deal breakers, etc. I’ve head of some virgins who don’t know where it goes but we’re not all like that, just because we’re a virgin doesn’t t mean I’m not sexually enlightened. I know what I like and not, and that will evolve and will be affected by the person. I guess it’s hard to explain to either perspective haha. The post was just me trying to ask for a chance for people who ghost after the “I’m a virgin” talk, that if you want a relationship and that the girl seems solid and healthy give her a chance instead of walking away just because you’re not getting laid, sex isn’t everything.

- No chatting
- After a match decide where and when to meet up by selecting/voting on options, the app then chooses for you based on mutual preferences and sets a date
- Put $1-20 down as flake prevention (you get the money back if you go on the date)
- Confirm on that day that you are still down
- Check-in once you've arrived at the date location to prove you didn't flake. As long as you showed up you get your money back
- Give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - Reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating
- Must verify profile

I (23M) had my first date with this girl (28F). It was kind of a weird thing, since we decided to have our first date as a weekend in an airbnb. It was great, i really felt that was a good time spent. But here's the thing:

She ended a 10 year relationship with this guy at June, and she says that she wants to be on their own, although she said before the date that she wanted to see if there was a thing between us, the old ""let's see how it goes"". She wants to meet new people, she wants to understand what she wants, she said that for a long time life was always the same to her, and she feels lost.

She said that before me she was dating this other guy, and the way she talked to me she said that they ended things, but left unresolved things to talk about. I found out that yesterday she met him to talk about these unresolved things, and that both of them dont want to end things, although she doenst want anything serious with him.

I really am not confortable with this, but i dont want to loose her, I mean it was just a first date. I understand what she is going through, but I dont think i like it. Am I being ridiculous thinking like that? Should I leave her? Should I stick with it? I am really confused, and i need advice because i don't know what to do.

I'm 5'4 and short women have told me they don't want me to fuck up their kid's height because they think that being short is like some kind of disease. Not only that, but a lot of short women seem to think that guys under 6'0 are inadequate enough for a lot of reasons. Certain short women have this superiority complex about being short and acting like guys love them because they are short while putting tall guys on a pedestal. I get the most shit from short women and women that are usually taller than me are more confident and chill. I feel bad for tall women because they have to put up with this bullshit short women have with bigger guys and it makes sense for them to want a tall guy, but the competition is harder for them and I can't even begin to imagine the amount of times guys wouldn't want tall women because they aren't ""Small and cute"" nonsense.",dating

Now, the issue is, somehow I attract people who want to talk about their childhood issues, have my advice on their mental health problems, want me to help talk them through a tough spot at work, usually very quickly into me meeting them. I also find that some men want someone to take care of them, or even worse, start talking about future kids 2-3 dates in (as in how our kids might look like, not kids in general).



I am the common denominator, so what am I doing wrong that I’m inviting such intimate (in all the ways I’m not looking for) conversations? How do I keep things casual?

Everyday I wake up and think about death. As I should. “Men” my height (5’7”) should be bred out of existence to alleviate suffering. Being short in these times is a modern day disability. No matter how hard you work, if you’re mentally disabled you’re mentally disabled. Same with height.

458,Why most men are disappointed with their dating life ?,"A world driven by lust and desire , disappointments are common. If you think this post is about me venting out my frustrations due to rejections, you are sorely mistaken. 

EXPECTATIONS , that is your enemy right there. 

Are you the type of guy who would go on dates or befriend a girl? make an attempt to impress her ? perhaps brought her flowers? chocolates? . If you do these, that's great ! But do you expect something in return? Maybe a kiss or something more? Well, she is under no obligation to do anything just because you were nice . 

The sense of entitlement we men have due to the good actions we put out there may not be reciprocated. She does not ask you to do these things for her, you have done that on your accord. Understanding that she has a choice is essential . Understanding that people have their own problems to deal with is important. Do you get frustrated when she does not respond to your texts or you have been constantly trying to make a move for sometime now , doing everything you can , being nice and respectful yet nothing seems to happen ? 

Most women face situations where a man constantly tries his best and when he is rejected or 'ghosted' , abusive and insulting texts begin to flow. Rejections are sad and disappointing BUT you do NOT take it out on her. She has a CHOICE. Everyone gets frustrated but controlling those frustrations is the key to self improvement. 

If you approach a woman, keep an open mind , realize that she does have to do anything or be nice to you. Don't expect anything from her. 

To all fellow men out there , be nice (*this does not mean you gotta buy things for her, being respectful and polite goes a long way*)  and courteous without expectations. 

P.S- 

* You may find grammatical errors , disruptive flow of content or something highly illogical. I wanted to convey this and if you got the essence of the subject , change is coming. 
* Although this may focus on 'man' and 'woman' , i hope it helps all genders and s\*xual orientation.

459,I’M DONE WITH BAD BOYS.,"It took a while for me to mature re dating bad boys. Perhaps I was enjoying the drama in my head, the useless, neverending chase of boys who only care about sleeping with me and dumping me afterwards; the high of being used. Is it only me?
I decided to straighten up. I’m exhausted and will stop entertaining this kind of guys. They are bad in paper and bad in bed (okay, sometimes good too but doesn’t matter)!",dating
460,How To Keep A Man's Interest,"1.) **Pay for something at some point during the date.** It's common for the guy to pay on the first date so it's cool to let him since he likely asked you out but go for dessert somewhere after dinner or even just grab some tea or w.e and pay for the both of you. At some point, by the **second** date, you need to pay for both of you. This gesture, even if you only spent like $5, will go a long way. <-- You should be able to figure out why so I won't elaborate.

2.) **Start initiating contact.** You should not be keeping count of who contacts who first. That's not healthy. Just exercise common sense here. After the first date, this whole chase me game needs to end. You need to contact him as well. Don't blow his phone up tho.

3.) **Tell him you enjoyed the date.** This is self explanatory. Yes, you need to explicitly say this even if you were laughing your ass off the entire date and it was obvious and you think he already knows.

4.) **Waiting 3 days for a kiss doesn't work.** I get the whole sl\*\* shaming thing and the all the BS dating rules that have existed but if you wait too long to kiss the man, he's gonna assume you ain't interested. Unless he's already really into you, which would be unlikely by date 3 for anyone above the age of 24, he's just gonna start talking to other women.

5.) **If you are the super conservative type tho...** if you have some deep rooted conservatism about relationships for w.e reason, then you're gonna need to find other way to let him know you really like him. I.e telling him that you really enjoy spending time with him etc etc. At this point, he's gonna have to decide if he wants to sit and wait 10 years b4 you are finally ok with kissing him. Most guys won't be tho so good luck!

6.) **There is no 6. This is the devil's number.**

7.) **Texting** \- Most questions on reddit are about texting. If you see each other a couple times a week then you need to calm down if he doesn't text you too often. **Are you texting him or always waiting for him to initiate?**

If you don't see each other often, over texting can burn you out. Ideally, you wanna be texting every 2-3 days at the beginning of the relationship. How much you start texting once the two of you are firmly in a relationship may change tho. Some ppl text more but if you've only been on 1-3 dates, texting every day is too much.

Hopefully this will help all you ""poor unfortunate souls! So sad, so true! This one wants to get the girl, that one wants to get the guy, do I help them? Yes, indeed!"" Now give me my karma.

461,Are men romantic anymore?,"After trying to ask a few men what their romantic dreams are on tinder and being met with mostly silence, I have to wonder - are men romantic anymore? 

Ladies, when's the last time men did something romantic to impress you, build trust, show their depth as a person, show how much they care about how you feel/how they want to know/understand how you feel, turn you on? 

This is the point of romance. To get women interested in trusting and opening up to men (because we face real threats of violence and being used in our relationships. The point of romance is to show us how you'll treat is the furthest from that as possible, and that you can keep it up). 

Guys, when's the last time you did this? Do you believe in romance? Do you understand/accept what it means for some women - building trust and attraction? 

What scenarios is romance happening in - what kind of relationships?

I get the impression that many guys seem to expect women to want sex based only on our sex drive, not when it comes to how they treat us.

 Of course, sometimes you want to get to know a person as friends or casually to even gauge a serious interest - however, many guys act casual and boring about sex, they dont build trust, they just expect to be handed to them without even being arousing or trustworthy.

I'm also detecting a lot of guys just having boring standards for being in a relationship - they just want someone to sleep, eat, and pay the Bill's with, who they can have boring sex with. 

Wheres all the romance at?",dating
462,"Two word responses don't count, sorry guys","I find that the conventionally attractive guys on dating apps speak in 2-4 words, tops. I'm sure that they have a lot of conversations going on but even if that's true...how is that tolerable?

I tried to talk to this really cute guy and the most words he used were four, **four.** I figured maybe he was at work but, ""lol no."" Uh, okay, bye.

Is it because they know they're attractive and just expect women to fawn all over them, despite their total lack of personality? It's even more odd since their profiles are usually clever, they can obviously use words but choose not to. It's like a way to reel people in and then....nothing.

463,Women on Tinder and hookups,It really astounds me how all the older women on Tinder who are post-wall are so adamant against hook ups.  Either there are a lot of guys with no standards or women are delusional about how attractive they are.,dating
464,"Why is the standard advice for those who can't get dates always to ""focus on yourself/work on yourself""?","This is the standard advice that is given to people who can't get dates. Even if the person explicitly states at the beginning that they have a good job, a nice family, a good circle of friends and they work out regularly, the advice is always the same - ""just keep focusing on yourself/keep working on yourself/keep doing you"".

These phrases mean nothing. They are no more than cliched soundbites which don't help anyone and I'm not sure why they get parroted over and over, to the help of absolutely no one.

475,Rough story,"23M here. Last year for 6 months I lived with a girl who I became super close with and I ended up falling in love with her. I have never experienced anything like the feelings I have for her even with a girl I was seeing previously. I once got really drunk and told her I liked her and she said she didn’t see me that way. I played it off well and carried on as friends the same way we were before afterward. She said she was impressed by this which gave me hope. We then moved out (no reason bar end of tenancy) but maintained our friendship afterward. I asked her out again after some drinks this time with some flirty comments and then a text when I got home. She friendzoned me again. Even now after that I still occasionally see her and she still wants to see me, she also always asks me about my romantic life. The issue is despite seeing her less my feelings are just as intense, my friends are confused as to why Im showing no interest in girls who show interest in me (I have rejected two girls who made advances and have given up on dating apps). I am just not remotely interested in anyone but her, Im going to continue seeing her and looking for signs in the hope she changes her mind but I have no interest in dating anyone else again. If I can’t have her then I’m giving up on dating altogether because no one will come close, all the girls who do show interest are boring af. My friends say I should get over it but I can’t even a year after these feelings first started. It’s gutting that she can’t see what we have but even if I accept she’ll never like me back I’m never going get into a relationship with someone else, is pointless.

It's been about a year since I've started working at my job but I've only been having convos with him for the past few months. When the day is slow, I'll visit other departments and socialize, his department happens to be one of them. I'm very quiet and shy but even he admitted recently that I'm starting to open up. Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person. He even commented that my parents did a good job raising me. 

My mom says that he doesn't like me because of his age but is probably just lonely and is also slightly jealous that someone isn't giving him attention, which he's probably used to. A part of me believes that because he does strike me as the kind of guy to do that but then there's this other feeling I can't shake. There are times he really holds eye contact with me.

491,"Everyone tells men to ""hit the gym."" So what happens when you do that, it becomes part of your lifestyle and values, and then you can't date anyone similar since fit/slim women are almost impossible to date?","I've been working out now since I was a teenager which is decades now. I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" 

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is >17% body fat for men and >32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.

492,"There’s something deeply agonisingly about knowing, because of being average, you can’t reasonably count on getting a beautiful partner in life.","
Please read fully before commenting, I’m just playing devils advocate 

I’m sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is “stay within your lane”, don’t feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

“Get realistic expectations of a partner, and you’ll be happier” 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don’t feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don’t you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it’s like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there’s average, below average castes, etc. We know it’s probably a good idea to “date in your league” to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the “caste” of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel “caste”, it’s just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I’m trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks disappoints me, and only because I’m a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I’ll be screamed down as an entitled pig or all manner of belligerent insult 

To me beauty is a wonderful thing, and to wake up every day knowing that I’m effectively forbidden since birth from easily accessing the world of beautiful people’s dating, hurts my soul. 



EDIT: just to emphasise, im not talking about personality, so don’t try to strawman it in here, I’m talking specifically about the western culture of “looks league”, ie, “she’s outta your league bro”, “stay within your lane” etc, phrases used in popular teen culture for decades, this directly implies an accepted heirarchy of “leagues”, so please don’t try to argue against it.",dating
493,Going undercover as a girl on dating apps,"So I always knew that girls got more matches on average than guys on dating apps in general but I had no idea just how skewed it really was. A few days ago I was curious and wanted to know just what it was really like being a girl on these dating apps. A female friend of mine let me borrow her pictures to use on the profile and I signed up for it. One thing to note is she is kinda cute on a good day but isn't someone who your gonna do a double take if you saw them walking around. I didn't wanna use a girl who looks like a twitch streamer cause then of course I'd get a million matches and it wouldn't be much of an experiment. Also I wanna make clear I didn't respond or talk to anyone during this experiment as well.

What I found was crazy. I signed up for tinder, bumble, and a few other apps. I would swipe left on 5 people and then right on 5 and go back and forth to have a good sample size. All of them came up with the same results. I started this experiment on Wednesday and it's now Saturday and in four days I got more matches as a girl than I did in years as a guy. I was honestly shocked just how many matches I got when swiping. It did explain a lot however. It explained why I never got anywhere with these apps. A girl can just pick the best looking guy out of the laundry list of people hitting them up. To get any kind of success on these apps as a guy you have to be about in the top 15%. I wouldn't call myself ugly but I'm not even close to being in the top 15% of guys. A lot of the guys that on there are super ripped versus me who naturally has a skinny body type and no matter how much I lift I cannot gain any muscle. How am I supposed to compete with these guys and why would a girl chose me when there are 10 better looking guys hitting her up? That's just one example and I know not all girls are into muscle guys but whatever a girl is looking for she is going to have so many different options to choose from what are the odds she chooses you? Like I said earlier I knew that dating apps were skewed but I had no clue it was this bad.

With this knowledge I can honestly say that dating apps has ruined dating for the majority of guys. Cause even if your not all that attractive as a girl you could go on any apps and have at least 50 people hitting you up after a week. Some of these girls end up developing a superiority complex because if they aren't attractive and they never really got a whole lot of attention from guys their whole life and then bam they sign up for these apps and now all of a sudden she has multiple guys a day who are down bad telling her she is an angel sent from heaven. She's never gonna care about you in specific cause she can just go online after your guy's date and have 10 better looking guys teller her how pretty she is on her apps. The only way now I feel like I could find a girl is one who doesn't use those apps and realizes what they truly are cause those girls tend to be the down to earth ones since they aren't getting attention from a bunch of random dudes everyday. I guarantee if these apps were removed from society dating would be a much more even ballpark rather than women having all the power.",dating
494,Back when I had a tinder (extremely short period of time) I put my height on my tinder profile so men shorter than I was could avoid me. (Hetero female),"This was about 7months ago.

Basically in the city I’m in, there are a lot of men I’m taller than however I’m not that tall about 5’7. 

on tinder it’s hard to tell and the two people I’ve met off it, I just ended up letting them know it’s not for me. 

everyone has certain physical aspects that enable the initial attraction for them. 

In my case it’s hard to see a man my height or shorter in a romantic light, I might really like your personality and would spend time with you(as acquaintances or Friends) but a sexual or romantic attraction just wouldn’t register(there’s only been one exception in my entire life to this). 
So I put my height on there to kind of let shorter men just avoid me all together. 

if they don’t and we match there’s absolutely no issue but I will not directly say to a person’s face or by text that “oh I don’t think anything romantic can happened between us because I’m just not attracted to you since we are the same height” etc I find that demeaning to say to a person  frankly because  it’s something they can’t change..

496,DO APPROACH WOMEN ✨,"Like the title says, APPROACH US.
I just recently found this sub and have seen SO MANY 
“Don’t approach her, she doesn’t want it...blah blah blah”.
That makes me so sad for us :(



I’ll say it, since no one else seems to want to.
The only reason a woman won’t take kindly to you approaching her?  
Is if she considered you ugly, and is NOT interested. Or you come across as creepy. If you can’t take a no, etc.


It’s so easy to go up to a girl and say “hey, I thought you were cute and just had to talk to you! I’m ____, what’s your name?”

Then small talk blah blah blah 
Then you ask for her number. 

If at ANY moment she says she has a boyfriend? Don’t keep pressuring her. Take the L boys 🤣 it’s ok, some people just won’t be interested. 
Also, watch body language, in dating...you have to be intuitive. 
If someone seems uncomfortable that you’re there? end the conversation, kindly. And LEAVE HER ALONE 🖤

I can assure you, most women want to be approached. Most people dare over online dating. Unless you’re in it for hookups, then they’ll be all for online dating, maybe. 




Here’s a deer analogy I heard recently...
Say you live in a wooded area.
There are lots of deer around and there are signs alerting others to 
“No feeding the deer”
You may think, oh but they’re so cute I’ll just feed them anyway! 
But there’s a reason that sign is there. 
When you feed the deer it loses the need to go and hunt it’s food.
It loses the fear of people.
therefore, it will frolic along to any hunter thinking they have food. 
They become complacent seeing as they have no need to hunt because people are bringing the food to them. 
Instead of helping them, you’re hurting them. ☹️




That’s what we’re doing to men on here with the repeated “don’t approach women” 
Stop it. Men, I can assure you, if you’re kind and respectful a lot of women  will admire the bravery it takes to approach someone!
And in the event they are not interested,some might introduce you to a friend or encourage you to  continue your approaches ❤️


Ladies, isn’t online dating exhausting? Let’s encourage our men with ways to approach us how we like to be approached than to belittle them for following their instincts.
Granted, many men do not know how to adequately approach us.
Therefore, coming off as creeps. 
Yet, that isn’t the approach itself,
It is the way it was carried out.

Ladies; if you have any tips for men on grooming so that they can improve their looks, or ways in which you feel most comfortable being approached? Feel free to please share! 🌸

But I’ve seen a recent trend on dating apps where men are now framing women accepting or declining coffee as a first date as a test of her “real character”. What? 😂

There’s only one of me. I can’t go on 5 dates in a weekend. If I have 5+ equally good dating options (about the minimum for an attractive woman in a big city) with all things being equal I usually just go with the 2 that seem like the most fun. 99% of the time that’s not the coffee date guy. Drinks, an art exhibit…literally anything(for me) is a more engaging environment. I don’t like to leave anyone hanging but when I politely decline the character attacks are coming 9/10 times from the coffee date guys.

Is there an internet guru telling men that the only thing women are allowed to care about on a date is having somewhere to sit? Is fun now a gold digging trait? This isn’t my experience with most men. But the venom I’m getting from the “coffee date or else” mafia is getting scary. Is this something other women are seeing?",dating

I'm just interested in if anyone has ever had this happen to them and they really didn't want to take things further but they went along with it because they didn't want to make things awkward or were afraid to stand up for themselves.

499,"If looks are NOT the most important thing women look for, then...","why are there endless Reddit posts everywhere from decent, successful, respectful, hard working men who have everything going for them EXCEPT looks, and surprise surprise, are single most if not all of their lives?

Please answer me that. 


Yes there are rabid psychopathic 1ncels who obviously are single because they’re literal psychopaths 

But for every psycho 1ncel  there are a hundred civilised, AVERAGE LOOKING, respectful men, who despite every effort, remain constantly single, lonely and miserable for most if not all of their lives. I am one of them. 

Why is it so horribly taboo, so impossibly difficult to accept, that maybe, just maybe, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel, EVERYONE prioritises looks, before they consider anything else? 

I’m just confused. Instead of sweeping millions upon millions of men under the rug and just telling them they’ll “find someone eventually, just keep trying bro”


Is it not more productive, to emotionally prepare men for the possibility that they may never find someone, and prepare them for finding happiness and meaning in a world where they’ll have nobody to depend on but themselves?",dating
500,It seems that most of my negative dating experiences come from not very good looking dates. Does this happen to you?,"I have had a date cancelled on the same day and of course was because she had found someone else (I don’t know that but it’s quite obvious that was the case, I literally asked her to confirm and she made  up a bullshit excuse and then faded)

This has happened to my like twice only but I started to notice a trend, whenever I give a chance to a not so good looking woman, there is a much higher percentage that she’s going to bail out on the same day, flake or ghost and other unpleasant and disrespectful events.

I am below average and I have dated plenty of average and some above average women.

If I try to date down first I rarely get likes, then if I do there is a huge chance they are going to act like that.

Why they do that?

Is that because they have insecurities and the ego boosting by modern metropolitan dating or apps make them super spoiled and selfish?

502,Advice for some in this community.,"Hello, as much empathy as I have for the people in this community, I feel like I need to shed some light on a topic most people often overlook, or rarely ever bring up, and it may ruffle some feathers but if it does oh well down vote it all you want. 

And no this isn't any theory or ""technique"" or PUA shit, but real life experience coming from someone who has applied it to my own life.

I cannot 100% say if this applies for the girls as I don't know what the dating world is like for females but most likely it will, but my advice is If you aren't attracting any females and your life isn't the way you want it to be.. Understand **it's you're doing.**

So much of the posts that I've read in this community are people complaining about height, race, insecurity, that stupid belief that you have to be tall and super hot, basically that dating all together is completely stacked against you. Other things I read about are people with anxiety, low self esteem, awkwardness, creepiness and overall negativity.

**Understand that almost all of those issues are from inside,** if your mind is all fucked up and negative, your outer world going to reflect that of someone with a fucked up mindset... **when you become stuped in negativity, you attract and breed more negative circumstances.** No amount of techniques or scripts of ""what to say next"" or PUA knowledge is going to fix what's really happening up there in your mind, you will still be the same person you were before.

To see some actual long lasting results **you need to take responsibility** for your awkwardness, your insecurities, your inability to communicate like normal human beings, because after all women are just human beings, and recognize the REAL issues that you might have are inside and work on yourself.. it takes some time but when you actually change your old ways and learn to love life and yourself, you'll get completely different results.

Stop the negative thinking, the fact that you come here to complain and obsess that dating is horrible and this and that tells me you live in a negative world and have some issues within you that reflect on your outer world, hence your issues with dating.

Most of the dating advice out there doesn't really touch on this subject so take this advice and really think about how you can start to improve your mindset to see better results.. stop the race and height bullshit because there are people like you that are happily dating, the difference is the mindset.",dating

So for now I'm just living my life.

I also occasionally have university meetups or events since I'm doing my PhD.  
  
I feel like every time I've talked to a guy in the wild in the last few months who I thought was cute, it turned out he already had someone (obviously I didn't know in advance). My working theory is that they have a non-threatning vibe because they aren't looking for anything, or that I just happen to have good taste if another woman has already snagged him? I don't know. Maybe.  
  
Point is, I'm starting to get pretty bummed and also somewhat perplexed. I assume some people will say I could try sporty hobbies, but I don't actually enjoy them, so I don't want to force myself to do things I genuinely don't care for just to potentially meet a guy. Also, a very sporty person wouldn't be a good fit for me unless they really don't care if I'm not, which in my experience is usually not the case. Plus, I'm busy. If I'm gonna try new hobbies, which I'm very open to, I want to do things I actually enjoy.

506,A woman does not earn anything from pursuing a man in the initial stages. Quite the contrary actually,"I have noticed that the general consensus in this subreddit is that a woman should at least reciprocate and mirror the interest a man shows in her in the initial courting stages if not actually take the whole initiative herself and actively bring a man in her life.

I do not agree with this and I think it works quite detrimentally to a woman's interests if she does not give the man space to prove that he actually wants her for a committed relationship. I will give you my reasons why I think this is so and I am also open to changing my view (if proven otherwise).

A woman who pursues a man with the interest in bringing him into her life without first letting him prove his interest risks a lot. 
First of all, a man will not object to this because he'll have his needs met (from sexual needs to emotional, to companionship etc) and be quite happy, but a woman needs more than basic needs met, she needs security in the form of commitment. Men find it difficult to commit (that is why you see so many posts from women spending years with a man who is happy to reap the benefits a woman gives him but who will make excuses against commitment) because they are not so sure about that particular woman.

A woman is the one who becomes pregnant and needs to know that the man will stand by her to provide and protect, but a man who isn't necessarily sure about her can leave especially in this day and age. This is why women need to leave that space to a man in the initial stages of dating to prove to her that he really does care about her and he is interested in her not just interested in fulfilling his needs (attention, companionship, sex, passing of time etc). Men can spend years in this context but women will that something is missing.

In addition to this, take sex for example. Women don't easily reach orgasm as men do. Women often are left unsatisfied. 

My take on this is that I won't really put in work in the initial courting stages for a man. No. You as a man need to show me through your actions and words that you are interested in me.",dating
507,The tables have turned…,"I’m 24F and today I got ghosted for the first time. First of all. Why. The . Fuck. Does rejection hurt so badly??? 

I have gone on dozens of dates, I’ve also had 4-5 boyfriends etc, but I’m always the one who leaves, or at the very least the relationship was just so drug out that we mutually ended it. I usually don’t ghost people as I’m a very efficient communicator but I’m not afraid to reject anyone at any point and ending relationships usually doesn’t cause me too much pain.

I met someone on a dating who left me nervous and with butterflies in my stomach. He may have been the most attractive guy I’ve ever seen (imo probably not traditionally) We texted for weeks, he made me feel pretty and desired. We decided to meet in person last night. He lives a few hours away so I decided to drive to him and we agreed if the vibes were okay I’d just spend the night. 

I thought it went so well, like genuinely thought I could see myself with this guy. It only got weird when I rejected having sex with him. (He mentioned wanting a long term relationship and I told him before coming I wouldn’t be down to have sex because that’s just a little too soon and he agreed to that)

He basically sent me home this morning, told me to text him when I got home. I obliviously thought things were going to be the same when I got home. I texted him and then a few hours later with no response I started getting nervous. I decided to double text him after about 4 hours just incase. Hours later, nothing.I checked instagram and saw he’s been active all day. I posted an instagram story today and he even viewed it. 

Honestly I feel really shitty about myself and I just don’t have a lot of experience with rejection so I have no idea how to manage these emotions. I feel stupid for falling so fast as normally I have such a hard time falling for people and usually it takes me forever. I’m scared this is going to damage my view of dating even more.

509,Result of an experiment on Hinge - Role of race/skin color in online dating success,"It is a long post about the little experiment with my friend to see how race/skin color might influence dating success in US/Canada.

I (M36, single, never married, 5'7'ish) from South Asia came to Canada in the Fall of last year for work and started online dating at the beginning of this year. The experience has been brutal. I have tried OkCupid, Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble without much success. I got on average one date in 45-60 days, some of which turned into 2nd or 3rd dates, but all eventually told me that I gave friendly vibes. I will write another post summarizing my experience and learnings.

I am an introverted/geeky person. I socially drink, eat meat, and never smoke. I consider myself average looking but physically fit. I started working out a few months ago. My requirements/standards for a match, I think, are reasonable: no prior kids, age range (-5/+3), no piercing/tattoos (definitely not excessive), educated, reasonably fit (not obese), and have a job. I don't have any racial preference and am open to meeting any woman/girl as long as I feel minimum physical and emotional compatibility. Further, I consciously tell my brain to not get ""distracted"" by good, sexy photos before liking/swiping. I don't swipe on empty profiles or profiles with explicit photos because I am 100% certain that they wouldn't swipe back (LOL) and that it wouldn't work out in the long term anyway.

A couple of these dates became platonic friends and told me about the influence of cultural factors (indirectly racial preferences) in online dating. They even confessed that online dating was also harder for local guys and even harder for immigrants but they couldn't help me either beyond giving some feedback on my profile. After going through multiple cycles of deleting/recreating/redoing the dating profile, I finally became jaded but also don't wanna give up.

I asked my American friend, who lives in an American city, for help and he suspected the same issue of racial preference. So, he also became curious and agreed to create the same Hinge profile as mine. Since he is married, he had to seek formal approval from his wife to avoid getting divorced LOL. He used mostly average, some old/not-so-good/poorly cropped, six photos and uploaded them. All other details were the same as my profile.  We started the experiment during the 1st week of November 2022 and ended a few days ago. As soon as he created his profile he began getting 'likes'. He also sent all likes almost daily, but without a comment to avoid any interaction. He 'X-ed' all likes received and made no further interaction with any matches. After getting not a single match/like after 7-8 days, I deleted my profile out of frustration.

Based on my past Hinge experience, I got 4-5 matches in Hinge from every 100 likes I sent and got 1-2 dates for every 10 matches. So, 4-5% match ratio and a 0.5 % date ratio. My friend sent over 190 likes before deleting the profile and got 15 matches. Of course, some of the likes he sent might have turned into matches over the next few days. He also got about 25 likes.  To be fair, all matches/likes have to be compatible, and not of the likes he received met his or my standards. Still, all of that happened with minimal effort in profile creation or photos on his part. He used my (possibly) boring/geeky prompts, without using his own input. So, had he actually tried, he should have been more successful. I verified all these from his Hinge data.

While it is hard to say whether race alone was a factor but given that everything else was the same and photos were average, it was definitely an important factor.  I cannot judge his attractiveness but I would guess that he would be a regular, maybe average/slightly above American guy.  I understand people have preferences and they make choices based on that. I wouldn't even call racial preference in making a personal decision racism. My purpose behind writing this post is not to judge people either. However, I am simply venting that people from no country - no matter how liberal, progressive, wealthy, or developed - are truly free from such biases no matter what they say or how educated they become. It is a different question whether having such biases is a good or bad thing and I don't know the answer since I also have such biases as well, and therefore, am not perfect either.

If you say go to big cities for success,  I think it is unlikely to be useful. As a matter of fact, I changed my city in Hinge to Toronto for a week, with no success or even fewer matches. I even changed to NYC, where I got a couple more matches but that was about it. There were no 'flood' gates. Having 2 matches instead of 1 means 200% improvement, but practically it is insignificant.

If you say why I don't find someone from my country. It is a good question and arrange marriage is an option.  I have been trying that but many times the potential match is in another country and/or already well-established. Also, I am just starting over again and I don't want to leave North America in the mid to long-term future. So, in nearly all cases there are logistical issues in arranged marriages LOL. Also, I don't know if I can make that decision over a video call since it might be years before visit back to my home country again. So, it hasn't been that convenient either.

Back to my dating life, here are some observations, some of which are already well-known to the Online Dating Community (OLD). Please note that these are generally true, but not always.

1. Photos and the rules (1 & 2) mostly matter if you are ""one of them"", which could be based on race or skin color, etc. There could be zillion other factors.
2. Once you are one of them, your profile mostly matters if you have good photos.
3. In your good photos, rules 1 and 2 are still supreme - be attractive, and don't be unattractive in your photos. Or if you are attractive, all your photos become good.

My final words to men/guys, especially those who are white or American/Canadian and have a job, but are still struggling to even get a date: if I can get one date in two months, then you can easily get at least one date every 1-2 weeks. If you are not getting any dates, then, to be honest, I wouldn't blame apps or women/girls for that. I think you need to get some good smiling outdoor pics and maybe some non-creepy non-generic prompts. You can easily get dates. Whether you can convert those dates into a relationship is another matter.

TLDR: I (brown South Asian) asked my white (US Caucasian) friend to create a Hinge profile the same as mine (every single detail) but use his photos and choose the same city (in Southern Ontario, but not Toronto) as mine. He got 2-3 times more matches and 10-15 times more likes than I did.

Treating your partner with lust, desire. Slapping her ass when i come home, making time to make sex out of nowhere, doing unpredictable things, not following routine, suprising your partner with new things.


As far as im concerned, pure lust and desire is objectification in simplest form.

I wont be naughty, i wont be prude i wont desire to do unimaginable things to someone who doesnt reciprocate or doesnt enjoy it at all.

So my question is:

Why is this considered objefication of women and its treated like the most hateful thing to do to women, while when im not doing it after they got used to it, its suddenly not okay that i stopped doing it, because they liked it.

It feels like im guilty for doing it. Feels like im guilty to be the villain to manipulate them only to show them what they will like or what not. How they are supposed to know what they like if they didnt try it yet.

It occurs to me how insanely easy it is for a woman to be attractive. All she has to do is what I just did - go on a diet for a few months. Lose 10-20 lb. Or if she's very overweight, diet longer and lose more. It's zero challenge. I eat a bag of vegetables for nutrition, have a protein shake, and have a small meal or two. This is honestly not hard. I could do this forever with just a bit of willpower.

If I was a woman, I would already be in the top 1% just from my body fat not being obese. Yet as a man, everything I do is worthless. Women don't care about this type of hard work unless you're a steroided top 1% genetics Instagram model.

What can you do as a man to become attractive? Make money? Get new clothes? Get a fancy camera? Read self-improvement books? Post for profile reviews? Make female friends? None of these things matter. Done all and still zero matches.

The only guys who are attractive to women are the same ones who were attractive at 12 years old. You're either born with the narrow range of genetic looks they want or you're fucked. 

Being a man while trying to become attractive is a joke. While for a woman the bar couldn't be lower. Literally just do what I've done the past few months (which was incredibly easy compared to everything else I've tried to do) and you will make it to the top tier.

522,"To the women of Tinder, I've seen glasses of water with more depth.","A little about me here: What I would call maturity I've had for a lot longer than even the earliest of my peers. Growing up on a farm and transplanting to the city I've been given a wide berth of ""acceptable"" behavior. Meaning I can self govern, and rely on others to set the bar for behavior... You might even say I have principles, but I wouldn't. So I'd like to drop a little bit of that male 26y/o aged wisdom, be it as it may...   


As a self proclaimed mature adult, these are a few of my pet peeves:  
\-I really don't care about your pets (yet), and if you care about them more why should I waste my time?  
\-Take you ""on an adventure?"" I'm not your maitre 'd and life isn't your fucking restaurant. Meet me halfway.  
\-Snapchat/instagram/whatever-the-fuck is narcissistic, and those filters don't do much but make me question why.  
\-Reading, hiking, and netflix aren't personality traits. They at best fill time, and very little of it at that. They don't define anything about you or your interests. They can allude to personality traits, and not all of them good.   
\-""just ask"" is the worst way of saying ""I'm lazy.""   
\-I'm looking for your love, courage, happiness, and values... not your thousands of (selfie) snapchat filters and party photos.  
\-I was taught to cook, sew, weld, monkey wrench, carve, speak softly and maintain good manners for the simple goal of being no more and no less 50% of a team. Zest for life and poetry come extra, but not at a premium. You should expect that basic package, but if you demand it... you'll only find false promises from guys that think they can put in the minimum for T and A. When dealing with the ""good"" guys, ""extras"" should break the tie... don't feed the trolls. There are a lot of subjective values here, insert as ye may. 

Now for the wisdom bits: Firstly, I'm touched by the magic of autism. I'm pretty assuredly going to be -off- on some things here. But like art, sometimes it takes a new perspective to really appreciate the essence of something. People's inner workings are a mystery to me sometimes, but I can tell you that shit is rotten even without knowing what powers it.   


Secondly, everyone is human. Which also means everyone is fucking broken in some way. They can be beautifully broken, tragically broken, and contently broken. If you're comfortably numb, narcissistic, depressed, and/or hedonistic... that's okay. I love you anyway. No matter your particular brand of bullshit, human beings can love just about anything -- with the caveat that you try to do better. If it's the new 'meta' to gussy up shit with filters and platonic platitudes, think for yourself and get out of that perfumed shit show.

523,I was attacked by a random female at a concert and my lady didn't defend me.,"We went to a Black Crows concert.  It was my girlfriend and a bunch of our female friends. Concert was so great; standing room only. 

We get near the end of the concert and a group of women come up behind us. Encore starts and people scream as usual. 

One of the random girls behind me screamed right next to my ear. So I gave her a side eye. She then took it as a personal challenge and began screaming louder directly into my ear. I'm tough, I ignore it.  She continues to scream louder, pressing her body into me, totally invading my space, as much space as you can have at a crowded concert.  I'm a big guy and can handle myself well and would never dream of hitting another women. 

She continues, stepping onto her tippy toes to get closer to my ear. I look at my girlfriend. She just looks at me. 

The random girl continues to scream into my ear, then she grabs my arm and starts shaking my arm violently, digging her nails into my arm.  I'm looking at my girlfriend like,"" are you going to do anything?""

After being assaulted and harassed by this girl for over a minute, she just went away. 

I was very upset that my girlfriend didn't defend me. I'm a guy, I would never dream of ever putting my hands on a woman. 

However, if the roles were reversed and a dude did this to my girl, I would have fucked him up. But a girl does this to me and my girl just sits there and watches. 

How could she just let this chick scream in my ear and assault me without defending me or at the very least going to get security?

525,I was told by several dudes that I’m fat,"So I went on a couple of dates within a few week period. One guy I went on a few dates with that I met off of Facebook dating. He seemed like a nice guy at first. But then he made it clear that he thinks of me as more of a sister. I said ok. I also asked him if my weight had anything to do with it and he dodged the question with a comment saying “want to work out at the gym”? So I took that as him implying I was fat. 

Then I went on a single date with a guy I knew from high school. The second I approached him at our agreed meeting spot, his eyes bugged out of his head at my appearance. He told me he remembers me being skinny back in the day and he doesn’t date “fat girls”. I was very offended and made me feel more self conscious about my curves. 

The point of this post is that I know I’m curvy but what ever happened to not judging someone based on the outside? What about what’s inside? What happened?",dating
526,Attracted to a man i find repulsive,"

I am 22 he’s 24. 



I feel embarrassed and weird but here we go. 


This guy, “X” is a close friend of the guy my bestie is seeing. 


X is everything i find disgusting in people. Arrogant. Thinks he’s in a movie at all times. Macho man. H0rny asf. Thinks with his dick. Would f^ck anything. Idolizes Tony Montana. Always has sunshades on his eyes or head. Acts like a maf1a boss. Thinks its cool to put his leg up while driving. Is just soooo childish. 
He sadly also knows he is very, very good looking and lots of ladies like him. Which completely gets to his heads. He really thinks he’s above everyone, including the law. 



The first time we met he flirted with me. I was not impressed, i already had a clear image of his personality. We ended up having an argument because he just ignored me after that and i thought that was childish of him and he said well u’r not interested what should i do? Alcohol was involved. Btw he ended up buying me drinks & water after our fight even though i told him i didn’t want him to. 




Second time we met he greeted me with an “hey my love how r u” which made me sick to my stomach, i immediately corrected him telling him he has to call me by my name. I ignored him after that and talked with the others. 
We ended up at a super crowded bar, where a random guy randomly hugged me and kissed my cheek. X immediately attacked him and our friends had to separate them. I was like hm yeah thanks that was nice whatever. 




Third time he was absolutely distant and just said hey. That night we all went to the club and drank. I was just really drunk. I don’t know why that happened but i ended up sitting on his lap and we danced together. Apparently we were sitting on opposite ends and we kept staring at each other & he just told me to get closer and i got on his lap. 
This isn’t everything. I constantly bit his neck and face  and  i was squeezing his cheeks… all while whispering in his ear how he sucks and i hate him. He kept looking me in the eyes, laughing and then he kissed me. I broke the kiss to tell him he’s disgusting just to immediately going back to kiss him. 




My friend who wasn’t too drunk had observed the whole thing and that was the moment she stepped in to separate us. The next day she told me it looked like we were about to f%ck on the spot. 
Of course i had a mental breakdown about what happened cause of how i felt about X. I couldnt believe i ended up giving him what he wanted and submitting to his ego. This resulted in me staying home and ditching work for 3 days. 





Just to end up seeing him again one week later. I didn’t know he was gonna be present btw. 

I didn’t want to say hey to him (we were on a parking lot) but when he came up close to me and i kinda backtracked he said “and then u say i am the one who has no manners”. So i quickly gave him a peek on the cheek. 



I then went inside my car cause i didn’t feel comfortable in his presence while my best friend, her guy and my other friend kept talking. 
X showed up 5 min later and demanded to be let in the car “to talk”. He said we could forget about what happened in the club and it would be no biggie, i dont have to feel bad but also said ‘i can now admit that i am attracted to him, its ok’. 
I told him i think he is repulsive and i don’t know what got into me & just blamed the alcohol. He said whatever, he doesn’t care anyway. Then left my car. 






I didn’t drive myself home right in that moment because i was the driver of the night, or else i would have. I was so mad at him and at myself for allowing such a thing to happen. I also felt completely embarrassed by the fact that my loud words didn’t end up matching my actions. 






Two weeks pass. So this last friday i was at the club. With my bestie and other friends. My bestie’s guy was there too. X was not supposed to come cause apparently he was on the other side of the country. I get super drunk. He magically shows up. Out of nowhere. 


I was dancing and he just happens to be behind me. We kinda dance together. I kiss him. He kisses me back briefly and then stops. Tells me “gather the balls to kiss me while sober” and just goes to other people/ his friends. 




Drunk me was like ok whatever. But the day after i was totally on the ground. So embarrassed and ashamed like never before. 
And then it hit me… I am attracted to him. I don’t know how that’s possible but its the case. 


The fact that he is absolutely gorgeous and has the hottest voice i ever heard is NOT a valid reason. Cause his personality and way of being sucks and i find him so disgusting yet i am attracted to him. I can’t even believe i was able to admit this to myself. I suspect that i was attracted to him since the first second i saw him but like my dislike and denial were too strong at that moment. And now? What do i even do? I will never be able to admit to him i am attracted to him. 



I will also not hook up with someone i find repulsive. I also don’t know how i am supposed to keep seeing him everytime i have to hangout with my bestie and her guy its 90% sure that X will be there too. Any advixe and perspective is welcome.",dating
527,"If women dont like to be approached at the gym, why do I see so many women talking to other guys at the gym?","I've read a ton of articles by women saying how they dont like to be approached at the gym, how they just want to get their workout done and leave, or how they want to be ignored.

Having conversations that they seem to enjoy because I see them smiling all the time.

I'm not saying men don't do this either, but I think men a more silent about it (it's a given so why mention it).

However I do ask a lot of questions on the date like hobbies & interests which is pretty normal..

My only guess is that prior first date I do specify that I am a structured person with a routine on working days so I will not be hopping last minute to see someone unless there's a plan in place. Also I prefer people who have a set routine & who take care of their health, mental & physical so I do ask a lot of questions based on that..

Like honestly, unless her answer is ""OMG I SAW GODZILLA"" or ""This text is to inform you that the person who is connected to this phone number has died"" - DO YOu REaLly CaRE 😑 how her day went.

And then I realized why...

She hasn't sucked your dick yet.

You maybe haven't even gotten to your first date yet, much less slid to home base. This is a delicate time. If you leave her alone too long, she might look or think about some other guy and decide to suck his dick instead. Her pictures are hot. She's been nice to you. Do NOT ruin this man.

""How was your day?""

""Great! 😊💗 How was your day?""

537,Am I screwed on finding a smart girl who's fit!?,"I embraced fitness for quite sometime. The more serious i took it the last apcial I became ( i. Ok with this). I started to go out more on the hopes of meeting someone. However it dawned on me that the girls I'm into (fitness oriented, athletes, body building types)who are as serious about fitness, and show it on their physiques, don't frequent happy hour or stay out late at bars. 

And, the consensus is that most women do not want to be approached or courted at the gym. So it's a catch 22. The place that they frequent the most is a no-go zone. And the places where it's socially acceptable to approach and meet them are in places that they frequent often 🤷🏽‍♂️.

My(f22) partner (m23) and I have been together for six years and have recently moved in together. Our sex life has always been adventurous and open minded, but recently we hardly have been having sex.

I don't mind that my partner watches porn, it's the fact he has been doing it when I've been in the house instead of coming to me?. I never really refuse sex. Sex has become a once a week/ once every two week things that lasts like 5 minutes. He hardly initiates it like he used too. Sometimes when I'd go to his parents house we'd have sex upto 5 times in the day. Now we live together it's become worse, he's always just gaming.

I guess she felt the guy was good looking and her friend would appreciate it? I didn’t make a big deal, but I thought that it was a bit disrespectful to do right in front of me, considering I’m also paying for the majority of the vacation.

544,I went on a date with the shallowest man I've ever met.,"I'm not sure if I should post this, but Louise, this guy was the most shallow person I've ever met. I just want to tell someone about it and then forget about it.

So he was 37, about sixteen years my senior.

He was attractive and financially successful. Throughout the two-hour date, he kept saying how he doesn't like going on apps in our Southern city because the girls aren't as fit and there are some single moms. He also implied several times that he simply does not find women his age attractive.

He mentioned his salary (which is high) about forty times. He kept talking about the car and house he wanted, as well as the house he bought.

I felt as if I were in a cartoon. At one point, he claimed to have a stack of books in his old apartment in a European city where he was stationed for his job (in hedge fund management), which he never read, kept there to impress others, and simply gave away when he moved.

He didn't have anything inside of him. He had no appreciation for beauty, art, or love, or anything else. His entire plan was to find the smartest and most beautiful woman under 30 to date him, and that was the end of it.

I've read a lot of dating complaints from women on this site, and I want you to know that being alone is preferable to being with someone like that. Do not be swayed by good looks and money if the person has nothing inside.",dating
545,I (31F) slept with a power player (50M) in my industry and I feel so used and cheap/like I’ve made a big mistake. What should I do?,"I (31F) met a guy (50M) through work about eight weeks ago. He works in my industry and is incredibly successful/one of the industry leaders - the type of person that can make or break your career, knows everyone and is a power player. 

We went to lunch six weeks ago to discuss what I thought (and was told!) were work-related matters. He’d seen my work and wanted to meet to see if we could work together. Obviously, I was really excited about this and the opportunities it could bring. It’s not often that opportunities like this come about.

Over lunch I definitely found him sexy and attractive but I didn’t want to act on anything. Although we were laughing and joking, I wanted him to take me seriously. He began telling me about his career and how he got to where he was and to be honest, the power (and the fact he’s older) turned me on.

Just as I was about to leave, he said he’d like to take me to dinner. I said sure but was slightly hesitant. The main reason is that I am a female climbing up the career ladder. If people in my circles find out I went on a date with him, they’d obviously assume I was trying to sleep my way to the top. I have spent YEARS trying to make my career and am just starting to be noticed for my work.

Anyway, over the past six weeks, we texted a lot. He would say things like I’m beautiful, he really likes me and wants to wine and dine me. He’d sometimes call or FaceTime me as well. It is obviously flattering having someone in a high position saying these things to you, but I am not stupid - I know what men can be like. Still, I wanted to believe that I was special.

We planned a couple of dates but he cancelled both of them, saying he was ill. I do believe he was unwell but experience tells me if they keep cancelling they are not that interested romantically. So, I took a step back and assumed nothing would happen. Perhaps my lack of reciprocity scared him because he kept texting me and apologising profusely afterwards, saying he genuinely was really unwell and was having to fly specialists in from abroad, but would make it up to me eventually.

Right after he cancelled our dinner, he invited me to a works dinner to “make up for it”. This is an exclusive dinner that many of my work colleagues would not be invited to. Again, I wasn’t sure if I was in the right stage of my career to attend, but I decided to bite the bullet and go. I went along with my female work colleague but he was nowhere to be seen. I almost felt like he was avoiding me but I have anxious attachment so tend to take things like this as rejection. 

I texted him asking where he was and he didn’t reply until the following morning, saying he must’ve missed me. I said thanks for the invite and left it at that. He said he’d try and see me this week and I thought “yeah right”.

Fast forward to yesterday. He texted me at 2pm asking if I was free in the evening for dinner, and if I’d like to come to ANOTHER fancy works dinner next week. I said sure. He then called me to make plans and said we could meet at his apartment first.

I turned up to his apartment (which was amazing) and we walked to dinner. He kept trying to link arms with me, kept flattering me, etc. To be fair he has lost some weight and looks tired from being unwell, but I still found him attractive.

We were sat in the restaurant, laughing and joking once again, but he would switch between paying me compliments, to saying immature stuff like “the waitress is hot”. I asked if he wanted children and he said he’d like a baby, but without the “hassle” and “drama” of a woman (?). He then said he’d be the type of “old man” I’d think fondly about when I eventually got married. He said stuff like “we should go on a trip to X!” or “we should go to X for a spa day!”, then saying he struggles to be in a relationship. He even offered to help me with anything I need in my career - anything at all.

I began drinking because I felt… well… sad. I’d been looking forward to this date and assumed he liked me because of the non-stop communication & compliments for the past 6 weeks. 

To cut a long story short, we went back to his apartment and started making out. One thing led to another and we slept together. It was good, but literally less than 10 mins after we finished, he said he was going to have a bath now and did I have enough money for a cab home.

As I was ordering my car, I made a comment about how I’d never dated anyone with his star sign before. It was a throwaway comment but he turned round and said “we’re not dating” really abruptly. I just said, “yeah, I meant in general”. He made it very clear that a relationship would never come out of this… which contradicts some of the comments he’d said to me before, like how I could be his second wife (a weird joke but whatever). He then said he’d get his assistant to send me info for the dinner next week. I said I regretted sleeping with him as that wasn’t part of my plan for the evening & he said don’t worry, no one will find out.

He even said “stick with me” - that women he dates either become super successful, or end up with great husbands. 

I left his apartment feeling so shitty about myself. I feel really used & cheap… and confused as hell.

I don’t want mean comments on here because I know, and feel, incredibly stupid. But now I don’t know what to do. It’s clear he is not the relationship kind, but if I ghost him or be rude, it could really damage my career. He texted this morning asking if I got home alright and I said yes. I don’t plan on initiating any texts anymore.

How do I play this now that my emotions are involved? Or do I just play him at his own game and use him back, even though that’s not my character? I worry his assistants will start putting two and two together & that they’ll start thinking bad things about me.",dating

The more I get to know him, the more I realize that I really like his vibe. Like he makes me laugh so much to the point I have a headache but other than that, he really has a lot of great qualities. I’d like to spend more time with him outside of his place like going on dates, doing activities together and get to know each other on another level.

549,Dealing with men with double standards about sex,"
It seems that most men I’ve met have some sort of double standard about sex and partners . I am in my 30s and I have had few partners  I think , compared to most modern women my age who enjoy having casual sex. However I have been involved in sex work at different parts of my life. I have some health issues that have made working a normal job impossible so at some points of my life I was working as a stripper on the weekends and once I had a sugar daddy which is a long term relationship with one man with financial benefits. I did not see my job as a reflection of me and I was never promiscuous. 

I have met many men who have a problem with this and see it as a red flag, yet they see no problem with their own promiscuous past. I have even argued about it with men and one guy I was seeing said that I might not have been promiscuous,  but how would he even know? and why would I perform a job where I am around toxic men if I am so pro womens rights? I explained that showing your body whether it’s being a stripper, posing for playboy etc doesn’t mean that you are promiscous,and in fact many strippers I knew were not promiscuous because they saw the worst side of men and were wary of men in general . I also explained that in a time where women are still not equal to men and aren’t payed equally to men, and where I was just trying to make the most of my health situation , it’s not really fair to be judging me for trying to survive. He didn’t believe that women aren’t payed equally to men and I sent him supporting studies that showed it as well as studies that showed that women aren’t given the same opportunities as men as far as raises and hiring for the same educational background. Women also cannot work the same jobs as men and there are far less successful trade jobs that women can do compared to men, so that if women want to have a good paying job they will often need a college degree. 

I am tired of explaining myself and I am tired of fighting men on these things. If there should be a double standard at all about sex, it should be that men should be judged more harshly than women for having it then women. Because we still live in a culture where misogyny is still very real and alive, a man telling a woman he has engaged in casual sex I think is more telling that he may view women as sexual objects. In studies where women had casual sex they reported not being satisfied and described feeling used. They felt that the men just used them like a human fleshlight. They didn’t care about making them orgasm. Women certainly didn’t feel empowered for having casual sex like many young women feel they should feel for having it today. 

But I’m not even having casual sex, and I can count the number of times I’ve had a one night stand on my one hand. So how should I approach the conversation? Should I tell men that I used to be a stripper and see how they respond ? Lol. I feel their responses are very telling of the views they hold. I also feel that being forthcoming has its drawbacks and am debating bringing up my past at all , and just asking men about their views on sex and women instead. There have been times when I have disclosed I was a stripper to men I have dated and their friends tried hitting on me thinking I was promiscuous. It created a lot of problems for me to disclose it . While I do like to be honest, I wonder what good can come of it.",dating

553,"Why do racial ""preferences"" almost always exclude black people?","It just seems curious to me how, people act like racial preferences are sacred, immutable, and inborn traits; and yet...obviously race isn't even a real biological category, not all people in any race look the same, race itself is so completely arbitrary that someone can have three white grandparents and white parents and a single black grandparent and be ""black"" (i.e. treating African descent like an impurity that ""infects"" genetics). Is it seriously just a coincidence that the race always excluded from ""preferences"" is the race that has been said to be filthy, ignorant, dangerous, hideous, and in all ways inferior to all groups of humans on the planet for effectively four entire centuries?

555,"Guys who are struggling with women, don’t lose hope, it gets better as you age","
As a lot of women get older, their tastes change. I see a lot of women in their 30s who have had their fill of flings with the stereotypical hot player type, got bored of it and now focus more on personality/stability because they’re experienced enough to see the bigger picture. 

My best friend is 5’6, was a virgin all throughout his 20s and is getting married to a cute girl this summer that he went to college with but rejected him then for another guy but came back around years later and reconnected when both parties were more experienced and mature

556,Women worship good looking men like they are leaders of a cult,"As long as your are physically attractive you can do whatever the hell you want 

Exhibit A: I was friends with this guy who is a known misogynist, racist, and bigot. He openly refers to black people as monkeys and uses gay slurs. Women give him a free pass because he’s 6’3 and muscular.

Exhibit B: This guy on Twitter tagged his fuck buddy and mentioned how he tried to convince her to take nudes of herself and her kids. Obvious child predator. He has thousands of female followers and some casually laughed at the suggestion. He got a pass because once again he’s a physically attractive guy. 

Women worship good looking men like they are leaders of a cult and it’s sickening. If I exhibited that type of repulsive behavior like the two guys that I mentioned I would get crucified. Women don’t care if you fucking rescue orphans every weekend. Just be physically good looking, have a bit of charisma, and be a little bit of a dick and women will be fighting for your attention. This is why I have given up on dating. I refuse to give a group of people attention who give free passes to racists, bigots, child predators, etc. just because they find them physically attractive.",dating
557,👉 Most common mistakes men do when meeting an ATTRACTIVE woman 👈,"
❌ You think she is WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!

She is charming, attractive and stylish. You start doubting your self, thinking: ""I may not deserve her, she is way more beautiful than I am and she probably has a lot of guys asking her for a date"".

Believing that ""you are not good enough"" leads to a certain kind of behaviour, such as lowering your voice, anxiety and getting stifled.

✅ Believe, by default, ""I am good enough for everybody"".

✅ True confidence comes from within and not from external validation.

❌ You are playing your ""A game""!

You know that she is getting a lot of attention and you think the best way is to impress her with your ""best moves"": The best pick up line, the best compliment or even bragging about you!

✅ Act normal and be yourself there is no such thing as ""A game"".

✅ Be honest, make a compliment based on her style.

❌ You think you NEED her!

You like attractive women, but it doesn't mean you need her. Operating from a scarcity mindset leads nowhere!

✅ Get to know her before you fully commit, and just have FUN! 

✅ Keep an abundance mindset!

558,Some positive of giving up on dating/women,"So recently I've decided the best thing to do at my age (29) is just give up on dating/women entirely, completely eliminate the idea of dating or a relationship, or having any sort of romantic attraction to women 

1. I do what I want, eat what I want, dress how I want. I no longer do things to ""be/stay attractive"" in hopes of attracting women. Yes I've gotten less fit as a result but it doesnt bother me, no reason to be fit anyway

2. I no longer get effected by women's preferences. I used to see social media posts about how women want this type of guy, or this height, or how they love this body part on a guy etc and since I never really fit most of their preferences, it would effect my self esteem.

I no longer care about that and it doesnt bother me, because I count myself out of that game already. Can't lose if you dont play

3. If I see an attractive woman or a girl I'm attracted to in person, they just kind of dont do anything for me anymore, because I instinctively write them off in my head before they even register on that level

4. More free time to dedicate to my hobbies without feeling like I'm wasting my time since they aren't things a majority of women are into (gaming/cars/tech etc)

So yeah, I guess giving up does have some benefits :)",dating

Meanwhile dudes hitting the gym nearly everyday, working on social skills/confidence, working aggressively on career, sorting out depression, or any flaw that comes with being a human, etc. What a joke.

I'm also not here to argue with any of the women that will come to this thread and cry that their dating life is hard. You're probably anti social or never wanted attention. That isn't the same amount of effort.",dating

But I am just wondering what does it say about a guy who first proposes to me that we ‘Go Dutch’ or I take ‘the next tab’ on our first date and on all follow up dates after? 

I am aware that we live in the 21st century where both guys and girls are perfectly capable of working and earning their own income, and this kind of social norm where guys are expected to pay seems irrelevant. But even so, the conventional social etiquette is that if the guy asks you out, he usually pays for the first date and girls can offer to pay her share.

I've done virtually everything I can to maximize myself physically: I run 3x a week at least, I groom, I have hair and skin regimes, I have a niche cologne collection, I dress extremely well,(the only places women approach me is bars and it's always only bc of my clothes) and I'm 6'3.

The main thing is my confidence is dead bc of OLD. I've tried every trick in the book and I've lowered my standards about as low as they can get, and I don't even get likes from fat and or ugly women.

568,[F19] why men don’t talk to me?,"This had never been a problem until I thought about it. I'm not ugly, I'm not fat, and I consider myself pretty cool, I have a dark sense of humor what makes the guys block me sometimes. The problem is that guys don't talk to me, just in a friendly way. I see some friends who are uglier than me getting invitations to go out and several guys around them and none of them talk to me that way. I don't know if I talk too much, if I end up being so nice in a friendly way that they don't see me as anything other than a friend. I just don't understand why guys don't like me.  I hope that doesn't sound narcissistic, I'm just being realistic. I think I'm very needy, when a guy talks to me I do my best to have a good conversation and sometimes I end up sending several messages, audios explaining something I like and maybe that's annoying.

569,Is a girl more likely to be in open relationships and have difficulty falling in love if they are not close to their father or are they completely unrelated?,"
 My question is whether someone becomes like that because of their attachments growing up or if it’s something that happens on its own. I am really curious as to hear about any one’s experiences. If someone isn’t close to their dad, does it make it harder to get close to any guy?

I feel like I tend to get more attached and I think it would be hard for me to not get sad if someone leaves. I think I’m an anxious attachment so maybe I do that because im not secure myself 

Is someone who is open and doesn’t fall in love considered secure? As in they don’t rely or need someone else 

Are they afraid of commitment?",dating
570,Should a 30 year old man in a relationship be following 20-21 year olds on IG?,I’m (27f) annoyed with my bf (30m) for following a 21 year old celebrity on Instagram. He used to follow multiple girls this age (some not celebrities) before we started dating and I told him it made me uncomfortable especially when he would like their obvious thirst traps. He was willing to unfollow them back then. This celebrity doesn’t post anything too risqué besides the occasional bikini photos but he was talking about a scene in a movie she was in that he described as a funny but sexual scene. When I confronted him he said he thought she was great in the movie and said he wanted to follow her to keep up with her career. She’s obviously young and it would be inappropriate to me if he had girl friends that age. It really upset me knowing he went out of his way to do this and I know I’m especially insecure but is it too much to ask him to stop doing this? Is he being horny on main? He said I was being accusatory when I told him this.,dating

I do this subconsciously bc I feel if I’m not their type, then they will cheat.",dating
572,You’re scared to approach the woman you like because you think she’s better than you,"If you’re scared to approach (the woman you like) you think the girl in question will get less from knowing you than you’ll get from knowing her. Essentially, you think she’s above you and that’s why you’re intimidated. Let me give you an example:

How do homeless people approach you when they ask for money? Or what about people who are collecting for charity?

They have a vibe which says “We know we’re taking something from you and we feel uncomfortable about it. We also expect you to not want to engage with us.”

And guess what?

**You usually walk straight past those people don’t you? You ignore them completely 9 times out of 10.**

But have you ever been stopped on the street by someone who thought they were giving YOU something? Like someone who wanted to interview you for a TV show? If so, how did they approach you?

**Like they were doing YOU a favor.**

Everything about their vibe said “We have value that you want and respect and guess what? We’re going to be kind enough to give some of that value to you today you lucky boy!”

**If you’re like me and 99% of people, you usually stop and listen when people approach you like that.**

&#x200B;

So what am I saying here?

Here’s another example. Let’s say I gave you 10 million dollars and told you to approach the hottest girl you could see and give it to her, would you be scared?

Hell to the no!

And why? Again because you’d know she was getting value from you. You’re gonna give that woman a lot of money and if she rejected you, you wouldn’t even care. You’d just find someone else who appreciated what you were offering.

&#x200B;

**Know your worth**

Well you know how women always talk about knowing their worth? You need to know yours too because it’s the difference between approaching like a peasant and being discarded and approaching like a king and being appreciated.

So how are you going to do that?

&#x200B;

**How are you going to know your worth?**

You’re gonna sit down and write out a list of all your positive points and I do mean all of them from the small things like you being good at cards to the big things like your business skills or whatever. List literally everything you can think of, and I do mean everything.

Also, if you can’t think of anything, ask people who know you for feedback. Those closest to us will see things inside us that we don’t necessarily see ourselves and can be great sources of info.

Then, when you’ve put that list together, look at it daily, have it in mind when you approach the woman you like, and watch how confident you become.

573,I beat my bf and now he is acting weird around me,"I 22F have a BF 19M, I've been doing MMA training since Middle School. Now I don't look like it many people say, Typical brunette 5 '6 130lbs, always sweet and helpful. But MMA is always something my family bonded over. Well 2 nights ago my BF and I decided to wrestle, it took some convincing for him because I honestly think he might be a little scared of me. He's about 6 ft 165lbs goes to the gym and will sometimes do boxing workouts, he also played football, basketball and track growing up, he also likes MMA but he only watches he doesn't train. Well we decided to wrestle, we were gonna do MMA with all the protective gear on but i didn't want to accidentally hurt him or he hurt me because he is strong. I tapped him out 5 different times before he quit. Now I'll admit I might have gone overboard but something about being on top of him and watching him struggle underneath me was so cute I couldn't help. I could tell he was embarrassed which I also found really adorable, he was blushing and hiding his face in was just SO CUTE! Now he is acting very submissive towards me, now he has always acted like this but I thought it was just because he was shy(which he is) but his friends said he wasn't like that with his old girlfriends. Now he is a very shy boy, it took awhile for him to warm up to me before we started dating(we're in college). But he's been acting WAY more submissive, like cuddling up to me more, and doing anything I ask(foot massages, food, etc) granted he did all this stuff before, It just seems more different now. I really really hope he isn't scared of me because I'll feel so bad, I don't want him thinking I'll hurt him or anything because he is the sweetest boy I've ever met. I just hope nothing changes and we are ok.

Please send help, prayers, or a time machine...","**TLDR:** Accidentally joking soft-proposed to a girl I recently started dating without intending to. Please just read the full context lol, I honestly don't even know how to begin to write a TLDR for this one...

Full context: I've been going out with this girl for 1.5 months now. Today, we got into this really engaging philosophical debate about immortality vs natural death over text. She was on the side of natural death and said she would not consider becoming immortal even if the technology were made available in the distant future. **I jokingly said that I still had 60 years to try to change her mind.**

As soon as she read that, I realized I REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALY screwed up there. I basically implied that I...

1. Intended to marry her
2. Planned on being with her for 60 years
3. *Essentially wanted to spend all of eternity with her*

THAT WAS WAY TOO GOD DAMN SOON!!! I don't even know why the hell I said that anymore. It's like my brain just mathematically calculated the most cringeworthy series of words to ever exist in the English language, gave them cancer, then spit them out to generate the most ultimate cringeworthy text of all times. And then gave that text cancer again.

After she read that, I admitted that what I said came out wrong, and I didn't mean for it to be so creepy. She agreed that it was ""a bit"" creepy, but said she wasn't concerned or annoyed by it. I just asked her to pretend that never happened, and thankfully we left it at that.

I mean, I do like her alot and I have at some point wondered what it'd be like to spend my future with her. But I didn't even mean it like that. I've just been studying too much and sleeping too little recently, so my brain's been really messed up. 

We've probably only been on 5-6 dates so far. We're both completely new to dating, and the most intimate we've been so far is holding hands. So yeah... if the situation wasn't already awkward enough, I just made it 1000000000000000x worse.

We had plans to study together tomorrow, and I don't know how I should approach her. I'm guessing the safe option is to just not bring up the topic in person again? Some part of me still wants to explain myself, but I don't know how I can do that without making things even more awkward.",dating

It’s really a bad feeling to deal with people who don’t value friendship or being a kind person.

I bet a lot of women experience the same thing.

I for some reason am never meeting those women.

I think apps are to blame. It gives people a false sense of security that they can just dial up another person like they order pizza. There is no incentive for loyalty anymore.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now.
Our sex life is rather fcking boring to be honest.
For example i’m used to rough hard sex, and disrespectful to a certain degree as in pulling hair and slapping.
But with my partner italways starts with me giving her head till she cums. Into missionary and then a position or 2 more. We can’t do certain positions because of the height difference & that my penis is quite large so it hurts her.
We only have sex in bed aswel. Don’t get me wrong it feels amazing, but its just so damn predictable and boring.
It got to a point where i just rather masturbate and get over with it.

577,Is this 32 year old man right about dating? I’m only 20.,"So I’ve been talking to this guy. I’ve never been in an relationship since high school. So never a serious one. He tells me an “adult relationship” means the man is providing all the time. He told me he’s mostly dated younger women in my age range but he broke up with them bc they were immature but he tells me “I’m mature for my age.” He told me how he took his exes credit card away so she wouldn’t spend money & wanted to buy one a car but put it under his name. But yesterday we had a conversation and I was so appalled at what he was saying, I wrote it exactly as he was speaking. The conversation starts bc I expressed how much I hated how growing up, the boys got to do whatever they wanted but as a girl I had strict rules. 


“The guy is doing the fucking. the girl is getting fucked. You don’t want your daughter to get fucked but u want ur son to do the fucking.pretty much why  it’s kinda ok to cheat but it’s not ok for a woman. U can’t put mouths on me but I can put mouths on a woman. There’s a change on ur body but not for men. Men are not made to be monogamous. Men aren’t made to have one women their whole life.that’s what u have to take into consideration when getting in a relationship not gonna lie. A man’s gonna cheat. Not gonna lie he’s gonna cheat. They’re  going to  lie to you and say they won’t but, it’s all in the way they cheat. If once a month I cheat but I still make sure to take care of my wife but the cheating is purely sex it’s fine. As long as I’m not bringing any disease or baby home. When a woman is having sex with a guy he is submitting to a guy. A man is not submitting to a girl.

Why are most women really very cold today, and they just don't want to be bothered at all?

579,Women get mad when I reject them for their height,"I'm a tall guy and prefer tall women cause it's more comfortable and I usually don't want a woman to be eye level with my nipples and neck.

 I tell women that are short/average that I'm not interested in them and they seem to get pissed off at me telling me that I'm an asshole for not wanting them because apparently every living man on this Earth wants a woman drastically shorter than them, according to them. I don't feel bad for rejecting women that are tiny to me and they give me more shit about it. They somehow try to seduce and flirt with me by trying to act all cute, but I usually don't and can sense the try hard effort which is a turn off

. A lot of girls that are like 5'1 and under tell me that they dont like guys under 6'0, but I really feel like I'm being degraded cause all they acknowledge in me is my height so I don't really feel valued and there's a lot of guys that are way better looking than me that are rich as well that are shorter than me so I don't get it. I don't notice this behavior from tall women, it's somehow usually women that are like 5'5 and under.

And also, do any of you get turned off when a guy does that in front of you? I would hope so, only because if not you’re endorsing a double standard.

583,I want to create an app for long term relationships. Here are some features I came up with.,"Here are some things I came up with:

* Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back.
* Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
* Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women.
* There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason to the person instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). This should be like a different button when you send a message. ""Message and unmatch.""
* You should see the description of a person first.
* Profiles have to have a description.
* There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times.
* When you have less than 5 your profile is visible again.

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth.

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice.

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

For the tech savvy:

* back to back encryption
* messages are not saved on private servers
* highly privatized

Edit: It is interesting to hear the more extreme opinions about such an app. The good thing is: You don't have to use it, and I am not going to blame you if you don't. I just want an alternative that works for me. It is supposed to be only for a niche of people.",dating

597,"Women are not gold diggers, you are","Men who don’t find looks to be a primarily quality in women, this post is not meant for you. 

Why do men expect a woman who has a banging toned body from spending 6 hours a week in a gym, hair always done, nails painted, clear skin from weekly skin treatments and expensive lasers, trendy designer clothes, high heels, makeup done, lashes done, not a single hair on her face and body. That’s what my sister looks like because she doesn’t need to work and is able to afford to spend her time on her hobbies because her wealthy boyfriend takes care of the financial aspects of their lives. She looks like a model and heads turn to see her. 
Well guess what a woman working 2 jobs can not afford the time or money to do this and look like this. I know because I am a woman who’s lucky to be able to go to the gym once on the weekend and tend to go for fast food because I literally don’t have the time or the money, or the damn energy to have celery juice with a smoothie bowl for lunch and yet you men shame me for having fat on my body or blemishes on my skin. I can’t afford having my nails and hair done or skin treatments, I don’t have the time for makeup, I wake up at 6am. I am always looking tired and feeling grumpy because I’m overworked and overslept. But guess what I don’t care if you don’t have a penny, I don’t need a man for money. I made my own by working 2 jobs but I also look like a woman working 2 jobs.
You can’t expect to date a beauty queen who has a toned body and perfect skin and expect her to work 2 jobs. It’s not possible. You want the cake and eat it too. 
If you stopped going for women who want a wealthy man, and instead went for women who are far from perfect and could overlook her flaws, you would never have to complain about women being gold diggers but yet you go for stunning barbie dolls expecting to give nothing to them. These women, like my sister, have thousands of men to choose from, of course she will choose someone successful and attractive. And I don’t blame her one bit.
I, on the other hand will choose someone who has a good heart, looks or wealth don’t matter to me but yet you men shame me for my weight.

599,At some point it’s natural selection and that’s okay.,"I don’t know who needs to hear this but, for all the guys bitter that women don’t like them.

This isn’t new. I’m sorry, but it isn’t. This isn’t Tinder’s, or feminism’s, or women’s or whatever scapegoat you want to use to justify why you can’t get girls to fuck you. If you wanna blame someone blame god. Blame how our biology works. Women want the guy that’s strong enough to defend her and her children from someone who wishes to do them harm, they want someone that will give them beautiful strong tall children. 

If you can’t do that, I’m sorry but the chances of you getting a girl are slim to none. I know that hurts to hear but it’s the truth. It’s just how we’re all wired. What girl is gonna want the average 5’8 guy when she could have the 6’2 jacked guy? Of course she’s gonna want to fuck him over you. It’s not her or even your fault. It’s just how the monkey brain in humans work. 

Let me put it this way, would you rather be with some vapid superficial beautiful woman that is amazing in bed or the morbidly obese woman that has a heart of gold but needs help getting of her mobility scooter. Go ahead honestly answer the question. You and I both know it’s not going to be the obese woman. Women don’t think the exact same way but wanting to and competing for the attractive guy is typical human behavior. Men compete for attractive women and women compete for attractive men. The only difference is that the woman will opt to settle down rather than enjoy the undying attention of 30 different men.

The attractive guy is just gonna fuck all the girls after him until he’s bored. We all can’t be that guy. It sucks. I’m not, most people aren’t. It’s just natural selection. We have to get over it.",dating

602,Why is it that womens standards are more uniform in terms of what they like in men.,"There are plenty of men who like curvy women, there are plenty of men who like thin. Lots of men like white, lots of men like ethnic women. Plenty of men like short women, plenty of men like tall women.

But women are more uniform in terms of what they are mainly attracted to. They mainly prefer tall, white men, broad shoulders, with a strong jawline. 

Obviously, not all women can settle with a guy like but this seems to be what most women prefer. It makes OLD dating a miserable experience if you're not a man that meets those standards and it makes you feel completely undesirable. In most settings, I'm always insecure if there are taller guys around.  I know that if a woman sees me next to a taller guy, it will be a no-brainer who she prefers. 

Consequently, this messes up my behaviour and makes things even harder because I'm always recognizing the attention that the taller guys get.",dating
603,Are men supposed to lower the bar a little bit?,"It just seems that our biology and society are set up in such a way that a man has to put in a fuck-ton of effort just to get any woman at all. At 24, I've dated nearly a dozen women, and I'm honestly baffled at how high that number is, considering my terrible economic situation. Not to mention that I have only ever had ***TWO*** crushes in my entire life: one I met in high school who rejected me (we were 20 at the time), and a co-worker who I went on 3 dates with that ended up ghosting me.

My point is, I see so many men who say they have found ""the one"", someone who is absolutely perfect. As if they have found their actual first choice in a woman. But I have no idea how I could afford to set the bar that high for myself. 

For example, I would LOVE a muscular woman who I think is a 10/10, is funny, has a sweet personality, and loves running, Star Wars, and metal. But I know that I have to be realistic. I'm trying to get with my FWB who has none of those interests.

If a man is a CEO, his SO might be an engineer. If a man is an engineer, his SO might be a schoolteacher. If a man is a schoolteacher, his SO might be an administrative assistant. If a man is an administrative assistant, his SO will have a minimum-wage job. If a man has a minimum-wage job, he's screwed unless he's in school or has some kind of good prospects.

Sadly, I'm 24, and my mental health is so fucked that I'm still being supported by my parents and might be in school until I'm about 30. People have told me that I should be going for someone a lot better than my FWB that I'm trying to get with. But I don't feel good enough to?",dating

605,I shouldnt have to lower my standards,"Good looking people did not earn their good looks, and don’t ever have to “lower their standards” and can effortlessly date 9 and 10/10 hot partners with no trouble at all. They are just spontaneously “wanted” by the opposite sex. heres the most critical part: NOBODY CALLS YOU A SHALLOW ASSHOLE FOR WANTING HPT WOMEN, IF YOURE A HOT GUY. 

To preface; Im 6’3 and passionate about gym, health and fitness. I have perfect hygiene and an athletic body, clear skin etc. the thing is, I’m bald, and i rate myself a 4/10 and have been described by numerous colleagues and strangers as “a bit below average”, so I think 4/10 is appropriate. my face is just not that pretty, and I have droopy eyes. I’m 24 years old. I had only one girlfriend in the past who was I suppose around 8.5/10, she was a known model. She broke up with me because she found another guy, but our first six months she seemed in love. I have Aspergers so I don’t follow many social norms and as such I stand out as an extremely entertaining, cheerful fellow to everyone who meets me. My friends love my personality amd I’m liked everywhere I go. im not shallow at all, and value everyone on the content of their character, and am exceedingly agreeable. Looks are just important to me on an extremely deep level, I don’t know why, perhaps it’s because I need a mental assurance that I’ve acquired compensation for what I so severely lack. Not that I’m entitled to compensation lol nobody is entitled to anything. Beautiful women just exert a magical force on me and I am spiritually addicted to that feeling and don’t want to let it go 

That ex girlfriend was three years ago. I’ve been single ever since, and have been unable to attract any girls on that level at all. Everyone is telling me I have to lower my standards and give the unattractive girls a chance. I don’t want to. Just because I’m very unattractive doesn’t mean I want an unattractive partner. The ugly girls often have better personalities? Sure. But there are also hot girls out there with sweet personalities too, why can’t I have one of those? Why should I just accept that she would go to a handsome guy who did nothing to earn her attraction or his good looks? 

Looks are very important to me, but so is personality. I want both, and will not settle for less than both.

I fully accept looks are important to many hot girls too, so I understand many of them wouldn’t give me the time of day.

But I’m mentally just not going to accept that hot girls with sweet personality are inaccessible to me because I’m not “in that league”. Fuck that. I got a model once I can do it again. I’m fine being alone, even for the rest of my life if necessary",dating

If say you don’t want to do that and you want to commit to a girl who didn’t slut around, well too bad, now you’re slut shaming and women will attack you for your preferences.

608,I [37M] think that women with fancy degrees that only want to date highly educated men are likely in debt up to their eyeballs and just want someone that can relate to that.,"I consider myself to be a good catch. I'm intelligent, funny, knowledgeable, generous, considerate, etc. However, I've never really valued higher education. I see it mostly as a way into debt. All the data shows that the ""you'll make a million more dollars in your lifetime with a degree"" is BS. Maybe with a post graduate degree, but even then it takes many years to pay off the loans for the degree, and you only net maybe $500K more in a lifetime. I'm not saying it's insignificant, but it's not a guarantee. I believe that debt is a real problem for most people with degrees.

All that said, I make a good living, have a house, nice car, etc. You'd probably guess that I have some sort of degree if you were to meet me. People are always surprised when I tell them that I only have certifications because that's all you really need in my field (IT). 

So, when I see women online that say things like, ""you must value education"", I think she must have a lot of debt (which I don't). I know that I can hang with them intellectually, but I don't think I want to be with someone with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt. Ironically, many of these women aren't even holding down decent jobs that pay more than what I make.

I also see the ""you must at least aspire to have a successful career"". What is a successful career? Being able to make a living despite paying off ridiculous student loan debts? Making it into the 1%? Blech

612,What to do if you get friendzoned?,"I (17m) am talking to this 17m girl. 
I like her REALLY like her, she’s so perfect: her eyes, her body, her height, her looks and those cute faces she makes. I would say my standards in a girl are extremely high but she bent my standards. She’s white and wouldn’t say white girls are my type but she’s changed that. You could say I love her but the worst of all things happened. We were speaking I made a joke, and she said “sorry if I friendzoned you”. This SHATTERED me. I haven’t had a girl before so I thought she was the one, but I guess not, after watching a lot of TikToks, a lot of videos stated “never get too attached to a friend” I felt like I should’ve understood it before it was too late. 

Previously, she got cheated on by her boyfriend but I’ve already liked her before I heard her story, she said she’s not looking for anymore and I knew this but I tried to like unlock it? If that makes sense. Aw man this hurts and we weren’t even together. I guess now I’m experiencing life. 

I downloaded an app called Wink to try and look for the 1 because I personally don’t believe in “you’ll find love when you stop looking” I met her on it and she’s the first girl I’ve opened up to. I opened up to her, I don’t think she realised how special she is to me. 

I started speaking to girls through wink as I’m not good at speaking to them in real life so me speaking through a digital screen is much easier. I hoped of making a girlfriend through the app not friends so me being friend-zoned won’t accomplish anything. What should I do? I don’t think she feels the same way towards me so even if I open up to her she’ll just repeat that she’s sorry for friendzoning me.

613,I think the system of online dating is just built against men.,"i’m going to start by saying i don’t think it was in any way intentional and meant to hurt men, but i do still think it puts you guys at a disadvantage. (also feel free to correct me if i’m wrong on any of this i haven’t looked this stuff up in ages) also this is for dating, not hooking up

so let’s start by talking about how men and women form bonds in general. i want to make it clear not every person will fall into either or box, as well as the existence of nonbinary ppl (which online dating ROYALY fucks). Generally speaking men and women are at least socialized differently when it comes to emotions and relationships.

men form relationships based on shared interest, and looks (this isn’t inherently bad fellas dw). in friendships men more easily bond with other guys who like what they like. they grow closer by sharing these activities with one another. when finding a partner their initial draw based on how they look also plays a large role. 

women form relationships based on shared emotion/experiences and looks. in friendships women bond by sharing emotions and time with those around them. looks definitely play a role in relationships but it can often fall into a secondary position. 

on dating apps all you have to go off of is pictures of people and their bio/questions (which lets face it bios in general can only tell so much). women have more higher quality pictures available than most men. it’s just not really the social norm to see guys who take sexy and cute pictures of themselves like it is for women. bios are also a pain for most people but many guys either don’t put in the effort or simply don’t know what’s appealing or appropriate to put which again goes into how men socially don’t do a lot of talking about themselves and generally aren’t expected to in their circles. 

when men get on a dating app they will be drawn to looks primarily and bio and all of that secondarily (tbh this is mostly from being around college age guy friends and trying to help them get matches so sorry if it isn’t super accurate here feel free to help me out). obviously a woman having a bio can help a guy in making a choice but generally the appearance is what does it. 

women do go for looks too. let’s not ignore it. but if a bio is really good bad pictures can be overlooked (i really think style, confidence, and good photography can help most people). also if someone is previewed as attractive but as a bad bio or no bio they might not swipe at all. if there is a match and the communication isn’t solid, or the woman doesn’t feel emotionally connected then she will probably end it. 

since women generally have better quality pictures of themselves, and detailed bios men are more likely to swipe. women are less likely to swipe because they find the lack of bios and quality photos insufficient. so women are getting more matches then men, but then once messaging starts it is again hard. women expect a very specific emotional connection and if they don’t feel it how it’s needed they will move on. 

literally this could all be wrong but i kind of thought it was interesting. this may not apply to some older folks dating since i am basing this off of the experiences of ppl 18-28 and their dating habits. it’s not fool proof in anyway. i genuinely don’t think men are at fault. the system just happens favor ppl who have quality photos, average looking, and have a good understanding of themselves and how to communicate it. i think that how men and women generally approach making bonds also puts them a bit at odds here sometimes

anyway thanks for reading this wall of text",dating
614,Randomly I think about guys who get laid often and I envy them,They have a fucking amazing life. They are valued. They matter. Those guys are way better than me just because they get attention from women. I may be educated and have a good job but I feel like a fucking loser just because of my dating life and the lack of sex that I have had. I will never be happy until I get to a point where women are attracted to me.,dating
615,"Dating is dead , OLD is dead!

Comment after you get results 😃 I guess this would be fun!",dating
616,This sub surely isn't a reflection on today's dating reality?,"I'm reading the comments, and I'm dumbfounded. Has OLD really reshaped the dating market that much? I've been back on the market for 6 months, and this sub alone made me delete all the dating apps. I've been brainwashed.

So I asked what was she up to and she mentioned trying suggestions from a friend that might help?

Is it wrong to not want your girl to go to male friends to talk about intimate topics like that. She got really pissed about me asking which friend?

622,Why did he touch me so much on the date if he wasn’t romantically interested?!,"I [28F] went out with this guy [37-38M] on an okay date. He was nice, but I didn’t feel attracted to him. He kept telling me that I was extremely beautiful and his type, and touched me on the arm an upwards of 20 times, which is the most I’ve ever been touched by a stranger.

I felt kind of bad that I didn’t want to date him, and so I told him I didn’t feel a romantic connection but asked him if he wanted to be friends. He said he felt the same romantically but didn’t see us  as friends. 

I had to ask him why he kept touching me! It felt super weird as I didn’t reciprocate once! He told me he didn’t want to do an analysis of the date, and I responded that I just meant on the arm, but no problem best wishes, and he told me he didn’t want to engage with me at all. I said “haha okay sorry, best wishes with dating!” which was totally ignored.

The above was communicated in 7 messages total from both of us over 1-2 minutes, so I wasn’t spamming him/wouldn’t message again. 

That is totally fine, but literally why touch me 20+ times????? I don’t get why you’d do that for someone you so strongly dislike? (For the record, I understand why you don’t want to be friends with a dating app date!)",dating
623,Was I wrong to call my tinder match immature?,"I (26M) was just swiping a few nights ago and I got a match (25F). I looked at her profile and she was attractive, but I just didn't get a good feeling about her personality. Her bio and pics kind of gave off a gold-digger/perpetual college student vibe. I figured that I could be wrong though, so I just straight up asked her out. I usually go with a local taco shop, a farmers market ice cream stand, or something similar for a first date, but because of my first impression, I just decided to ask her out to Taco Bell instead. I figured that if she really was looking for an expensive first date she'd just say no, and if she didn't take herself too seriously and was down to just have a fun chat at the Bell she'd say yes. I don't remember the exact wording since it was yesterday and I've since been blocked, but the conversation went something like this.   


Me: ""Hey, I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell tonight. Want to go?""  


Her: ""I hope you're joking.""  


Me: ""Haha, nah. Why?""  


Her: ""You asked me out on a date to Taco Bell. We are ADULTS.""  


At this point I knew it wasn't going to happen. I'm an adult, I try to stay in shape, and I try to eat healthy, but I'm not above swinging by for a classic crunchwrap every other Friday night.   


Me: ""Yeah, maybe, but I just didn't get that vibe from your profile.""


Her: ""Are you calling me immature?!?""


Me: ""Well, since you asked...  yeah, pretty much.""  


Her: ""You literally don't even know me! Who are you to judge?!? \[and she went on to write 7 more paragraphs of basically this before blocking me\]



Maybe I was a little harsh, but when a global pandemic shut down my hometown and plunged the world into chaos Taco Bell was always there for me. They never let me down. 


TL:DR; I asked a girl out to Taco Bell, she implied that adults don't go there, I implied that she wasn't acting like one.",dating
624,Dating as a woman is exhausting because it feels like I have to do all the work all the time.,"It’s really hard and tiring to date as a woman. Let me explain. There are three main reasons why it’s hard to date men as a woman. 

First off, they always pass up women who are deemed as ‘ugly’ even if those women have showered and have great hygiene and clothing. Then they proceed to complain about women not coming up to them when plenty of women probably do, they just turn down the unattractive ones who aren’t good enough. 

Second off, they’re always complaining about how women never have to put any effort in at all. This is a lie, however, as an ugly woman myself, I’m always the one putting in all the effort, only to get turned down. So maybe if guys didn’t turn down the women who did ask them out, they’d actually get a date. 

Third off, and finally, guys always ghost on OLD. From my first hand experiences, we women always have to message first and then we never get a reply back. I’d know. Men on this site like to complain that women always get multiple messages on OLD but this is of course, a lie. They’re just picky, ghosting assholes, who perpetuate this idea that women get multiple messages a day so they don’t have to own up to the fact that at the end of the day, they’re picky jerks who are looking for models instead of normal people.",dating
625,My dad has kissed me on the lips multiple times..Should I tell my boyfriend?,"Although as I’ve grown up and am an adult now, I don’t like it but I tolerate it. My dad is paying for my university and I can’t do much about it. Back in my home country he’s a good dad. I’ve got a boyfriend abroad and we haven’t kissed yet, we’re taking things slow, but I wanna know if I should tell him about this. (My dad would also occasionally put a hand on my thigh and hold hands while driving in the car.) (I’m not living with him so it’s not bad.) What would this look like from a guys perspective? And how long into the relationship should I let him know?

Edit: he pays for the entire family and I’m from a culture where even dating is quite taboo. 
Moreover it’s kinda a lingering kiss and not a peck… I wonder if it’s normal in other cultures?
Also I can’t talk to my mom about this, she’ll tell him.",dating
626,How do I (22F) ask my bf (23M) to use dildos/penis sleeves on me without hurting his feelings?,"*Trigger warring this is NSFW*

I absolutely love my current bf. He’s smart and caring and one of the best communicators I’ve ever met. He’s so charismatic and I could listen to him talk about anything. 

The only problem is that the sexual chemistry between us isn’t that great. He’s very attentive and does his best, but he isn’t really “big enough” for me to orgasm during sex and sadly all clit stimulation does is give me the sensation that I need to pee. 

I feel terrible about this because I’d say he’s right around average (6 inches and yes we measured out of curiosity), but after being with someone significantly larger (have no idea how big but the orgasms were mind blowing) average doesn’t really do it for me anymore. 

I’m debating whether or not to ask him to incorporate a dildo/penis sleeve in the bedroom so I can get that “full feeling again” but I don’t know how to do it without hurting his feelings. 

Tl;dr: My (22f) boyfriend (23m) has an average dick and can’t get me to orgasm so I’m trying to find a way to incorporate toys without hurting his feelings.

Then he asked if I was pro-choice which I said I was, and he said he was pretty much against abortion, because he likes when things go naturally (have no idea what he means by that) and I think he tried to convince me not to abort it because he said it could give me new opportunities and that I can be a very good mother etc…now idk what to do because this is such a complicated situation for me.",dating

631,Poorly dressed men.,"Multiple times recently I have gone to a restaurant and out of the corner of my eye I spot a young couple on a date.  The young lady is like very dressed up, make up, hair done, cute outfit, purse, the whole works.  She’s sitting upright, attentive, smiling, engaged.  The young man is in like a T-shirt, baggy pants, baseball cap on backwards, or hair a mess, slouching in his chair not making eye contact.  This has happened enough that I don’t think it’s just a coincidence.  Are young men now not expected to dress nicely for a date?  Is it not disrespectful to the young lady to look like you rolled out of bed or just came from a skateboarding event?  Just curious if anyone else is experiencing or noticing this.",dating
632,AI will disrupt the dating world,"Hey, Redditers! Just a thought I've been thinking on lately. AI is really shaking up the dating game. I mean, the kind of tools popping up right now, they're game changers. I've been hearing that a load of guys are already onboard, and honestly, I can't blame 'em. The tools give great reply suggestions, with slang, emojis and flirty jokes.   
As a guy, texting is extremely time consuming because the standarts from girls are very high. Because of dating apps, they are bombarded with attention that has never been seen before. If you make one texting mistake, the girl will go away because she has another 10 guys texting her. As a man, don't want to waste time on texting, because it's something way more different than a live conversation. So here comes the AI to help, it's becoming great and I save a bunch of time that I would spend thinking of replies, so I could do activities, that actually improve my value as a man (which at the end of the day girls appreciate the most, right?).   


I feel that online dating made things for men way more difficult. AI could even things out once again. What are your thoughts on this?",dating

635,Why the male/female imbalance exists on dating websites,"  

I hear about how there is a massive imbalance in the male to female ratio on dating websites. I am curious why this. I would like to hear your opinions on the following factors and any ideas of your own why this imbalance exists 

\*Women receive nasty messages from oddballs. Below is what someone on reddit wrote about their experiences on dating apps

“I haven't used dating apps in a number of years, but when I was on them, I got a lot of sexually explicit messages along with insults and occasionally rape threats. Probably at least half my messages beyond ""hi"" contained that type of content. When I messaged men, some of them seemed angry that I messaged them. Anecdotally, it seems that my friends who are more conventionally attractive get less of that, possibly because men are more interested in having actual relationships with them.

I don't have any hard evidence of this, but my hypothesis is that this type of behavior drives many of the less attractive women off of the sites. If this is true, the consequence of this would be that there are fewer women who are willing to match with less attractive men. I also wonder if less attractive women are less likely to sign up in the first place, fearing that dating sites will simply be a microcosm of how they are treated in the rest of the world.”

\*Women are more content being single than men whilst men are far less content and the desire to find a partner is stronger in men.

\*Women can find partners without resorting using to the internet whilst it is harder for men to find other methods of finding partners.

\*Are women worried about safety if they meet strangers from the internet.",dating

On dating apps I get msgs & matches but it just doesn’t work out (ghosting, lack of interest, fizzling out etc).

I'm active and play sports, but am also feminine. I stopped dating for years because of fear of rejection in regards to infertility and I wanted to work on my mental health so I could attract others who were mentally well or trying to be. Last year, I decided to dive back into dating casually. 

I have a hard time getting dates. I have no problem getting someone willing to have sex with me. But I don't want these FWB situations. I want a real relationship. I rarely get matches on dating apps and when I do, and express that I am ultimately looking for a relationship, I get ghosted or the man has several young children or doesn't even have a car, which would make me the chauffer. 

Men with children are offended I don't want to date them, but I work with children and know what they need and I don't want to get into dramatic crossfire of baby mama or other complications. They didn't have to have children with a woman that they couldn't stick with. 

I understand women may have this complex that men are trash and will never be good enough, but I honestly don't believe that. 

Just have a goddam car, job, be active and healthy, honest, and think of women as more than a sex toy. 

I actually have a lot of contempt for many women because they make themselves readily available to men and so men don't have to put in any effort, and they aren't looking for relationships. I mean, it makes sense because if you can get all of the benefits without having to commit to anything inconvenient, then just don't. 

I'm lonely, I don't have family, and I don't have any true friends. I am in a very dark place. I feel like I am going to die alone. 

If there are so many lonely people out there then why are they just looking for sexual partners or babysitters? Where are people that want real connections and relationships?",dating
640,my only requirement in a partner is undying loyalty.,"I'm 28 f. African American, 130 lbs and 5'3. I have a warm and open personality but at times I can be self loathing and over critical of myself and others. I'm not always dependable but I make it a point to follow my word if I give it. I'm very adventurous and am also a bit reserved. I don't care too much about my looks but I do value my intelligence. As it's something that can't be disproven. Looks are too subjective. 

As of this year I'm going on 5 years of not having had one long term relationship. In that time I've had two kids. The first being with my last of my only two long term adult relationships. My second child was with a friend from high school who turned into a fb. Neither are in mine or my children's lives. 

Anyway my longest relationship in these 5 years was 4 weeks. Any other attempt failed after the first day. And I can count on one hand the amount of times I tried and came close to starting a relationship but then quickly realizing it would never be.

So I know I'm the problem but after 5 years of soul searching and trying to physically and mentally improve myself I've realized that my attempts are futile. So is that it ? Am I just going to be single for the rest of my life because I'm too flawed of a human being for anyone to settle down with? I can clearly see myself at 38 still alone and when I was 18 I said I'll probably be single in ten years and I was right. So I know I'm not being dramatic. 

I want advice. I don't want to be alone. And for the record I don't need a man to validate me or take care of me. I'm just a human woman who is lonely and wanting a life mate. Someone to wake up to and make love to. Someone to travel with and build with. And I don't want to feel guilty about that or be told that I need to focus on myself and enjoy being single. Cause frankly I don't buy that. If that were the case then everyone in the world should be single.

642,Dating models / influencers - Question about being superficial,"I'm just wondering about something and I'd like to hear your thoughts. Before I explain, I want to preface this post with one thing:

Serious dating isn't really that important to me at the moment. I love flirting just for the fun aspect of it, but I'm not planning on getting into a serious relationship due to some issues I need to fix first. You know, priorities. So now that's out of the way, here's what I'm wondering:

Are there any people here who got together with a model? I mean people who post their pics on instagram for example. In general I'd like to read about your experiences. How was it like to begin the conversation, how was it during the relationship if you got to that point etc. Was it difficult? Was it annoying? Was it better than you imagined? Or... there was not much difference at all?

The reason why I'm asking is because I'm a fairly superficial person. I agree about the fact that personality and chemistry are the most important things for the relationship to last long term... but I would lie if I said looks don't matter to me. Physical appearance and body type matters to me quite a lot. I'm the ""*I know what I want*"" type of a person. Even though it is a bit hurtful, I'm not giving people as much of a chance as I would if they met my physical criteria. I'm aware this approach limits me a bit but I also just don't want to lie to myself and to other people. You know? If I don't feel attracted to someone, I'm not going to pretend I am, because I believe that's even worse.

I realise this question is a bit pointless since humans are very complicated and labeling a group of people (*In this case conventionally ""hot"" people*) is unfair, but I'd still like to read your thoughts. Just as a way to expand my own internal horizon.",dating

So I'm a 21 yr old girl in college, pretty attractive (if i do say so myself), very outgoing, great social life, have lots of interests and hobbies, and (rlly not trying to brag but it relates to my issue) guys tend to like me very intensely very quickly. I'm almost a bit too used to having male attention, which has made my ego skyrocket, along with my standards. This all may sound great, but it has It's completely ruined my romantic/sex life and has gotten to the point to where I turn guys down in my head just by taking one look at them. I've grown to be so independent and sure of what I was over the 21 years i've been completely on my own, that now I can't even imagine being that intimate with someone and my fundamental attraction has become so narrow I don't give any guys a chance. I've only had sex with one guy one time, and I liked him a lot at first, but by the second time I hung out with him I was so turned off and repulsed by things he did that I was an asshole and just ghosted him like I do with everyone else. At first I thought I was just picky and knew what I wanted in a man, but now its just getting a bit sad and I'm really worried I'll never find anyone that lives up to the ideal man I imagine myself with. I'm not too analytical when it comes to attraction and connection, I meet people and can usually tell right off the bat if there's a connection or not, so if i feel it I feel it, if i dont I dont. I dont think too much about it. But basically every guy I meet I find something wrong with him or don't feel that organic attraction. 

I'm happy being alone, when you've been completely single (especially with only 1 sexual experience) you kinda get used to it and don't think about it too much day to day. But of course like everyone else, I get lonely at times and think about what it feels like to be in love and be so close to someone and always have them right there when you need them. And to be loved. I just want to experience what its like just one time, but it always seems impossible and out of reach. I'm sure itll prolly happen one day, but jesus its been so fuckin long. I feel like maybe I have issues I need to deal with or something. 

What do you guys think? Anyone else share a similar experience?",dating
649,"Ladies, how would you recommend someone with high intellectual intelligence but low emotional intelligence go about meeting women?","So basically I've already tried my hand at dating but none of the girls I was interested in approaching were even the slightest bit reciprocative of my advances. I'm an 18M btw, I've been told that I have a very eccentric way of socializing and that I usually don't make the best first impressions. Would like some advice on this, I also don't know if I should be approaching people on a whim in public.",dating
650,When your bf makes a rape joke--how would you respond?,"If the person you're dating made a casual joke about raping you, would you shut down the relationship immediately?

Basically, bf said, out of nowhere while we were alone, ""You're so attractive, I could rape you.""

I had an ex that said something similar, in that case I responded that it was not okay, and asked him not to make comments like that again, which resolved the problem. However, I feel like it was a predictor of how I was treated later (i.e., lack of respect).

So in this case, I respond a bit more harshly. I backed away and was like, ""What did you say? Do you WANT to rape me?"" He got flustered and lied to my face and said he said some other word, but then admitted that's what he said. Said he had  ""dark sense of humor"" and didn't mean anything by it.

EDIT: Ended things with this guy. Thank you everyone for your advice.",dating
651,"Should I be worried about ""all the good guys being gone"" in my late 20s?","Hi everyone, I'm 26f, very new to dating and am just starting to figure out what is going on after a year of trying and getting absolutely nowhere lol. I've been on dates with some nice guys but nothing has worked out and initially I thought it was ok and that I was just learning from those experiences, and one day I'd meet someone and it would click if I kept trying. But now after hearing people talk about this, I'm wondering if I should be concerned about ""all the good guys being gone""? In my own life, I know lots of amazing single girls but all of the good guys I know are in relationships. All the single guys I know are problematic for one reason or another. I'm worried that the guys who are single now are just the ""leftovers"" (someone else's wording but it made me anxious) and I missed my chance to be in a healthy relationship with someone who I'm actually interested in.

I know rationally that this isn't true, but I'm still scared that each time I go on a date with a nice guy and it doesn't work out, that's one less in an already limited number of options because of my age and lack of experience. Is this completely untrue? Are there still nice single guys in their late 20s? Some people have made it sound like there aren't and it makes me want to just give up. Is there hope? Thank you, sorry this is so silly... I'm just nervous!!",dating
652,Guy asked me to 💩 on his chest!,"So I was at the mall with my bff and I saw a this guy looking at me 🥹👀. He was tall and blond👦🏼with blue eyes. He was super friendly and kind.

655,Conservative marriage,"I’m a (21f) and I just recently told my friends that I’m conservative. They are liberals and Democrats so they disagree with this. I told them the reason that I am conservative is because I value Hardwork, I value men and the role they play in society, and I wanna be a good woman to the man that I marry and so many other things that come along with being conservative. I tried explaining my conservative views to the best of my abilities.My friends are “modern women“ and they don’t value anything especially men. They expect men to give them money pay their rent and they don’t have to lift a finger they don’t cook, clean, or nurture their partner. they sit around smoke weed all day and post half naked pictures on social media. I told them that’s not the type of woman I wanna be anymore. I’m celibate I’ve been celibate for around six months now. I have no desire to give my body to a man with no intentions of getting married. I was secretly conservative for 2 years and I’ve been slowly making changes to my life. With the way that I dress, and the way that I present myself to men. I’ve had my fair share of hook ups and honestly I’m done. I’ve never even been in a relationship. Every guy I’ve been with only wants to have sex with me. And it’s because of how I have presented myself to them. They don’t value me they don’t think that I am worth dating. I’m nothing more than just a hook up to a lot of the men that know me. It’s heartbreaking to know that I’m not worth anything to the men around me because I was so quick to give them my body. when I look at my future I want to be a valuable woman. I wanna to get married someday and have a healthy one. A marriage that is built on values, trust, morals and so many other things, I talked with an older lady who I work with she’s been married for over 50 years I asked her what makes her marriage last so long she told me a clean house, food on the table, and sex I agree with her. I think it’s sad that it took me this long to value myself and men. My friends think that I’m going to become a slave to my future husband. I try to make them understand the importance of following a man’s lead especially a hard-working levelheaded man who will never put your life or his life in danger. But will make decisions to enhance the both of your lives. Will do things that will benefit the both of you a man that has your best interest at heart. But they think that I’m making a horrible decision with my life. I don’t wanna lose my friends but I want them to understand that this is not a decision that they get to make for me.",dating
656,Just messaged my exs family on Facebook to be petty. How crazy am I on a scale from 1-10?,"So I was dating this guy for a month. He asks me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. Then he completely stopped talking to me and won’t give back my stuff. I asked nicely, still nothing.

It’s been a month since I broke up with him over text since he won’t see me in person. I’m about to move and I want my favorite pair of shorts and jewelry! So I asked again. I got no response… then I blew up his phone. All he did was forward my calls. So I FaceTimed him non stop for an hour. Still nothing. 

Then I commented all over his Facebook that he stole my things and that if anyone hears from him tell him to contact me. Then I messaged his mom, dad and sister saying the same thing. How crazy am I for doing this!? 😂 Don’t even miss him. Just want my favorite pair of shorts. They can’t be found online. An exclusive boutique makes them and I’m moving out of state. I bought them a year ago and there’s no more in stock. So no they can’t be replaced.",dating

658,Went on a date with a Doctor who is racist,"So I went on a date with a male doctor (38) and I was literally speechless with his ignorance and racism. He's half white and half Chinese but looks Chinese as in you couldn't tell he's mixed race. He told me he's into South asian women as then laughed and shared with me like I would be happy.. he finds them super exotic. Exotic is deemed as a racist outlook to women of colour as it shows beauty standards that are seemed normal is Caucasian. Anything that doesn't fit these norms, people say exotic which is offensive. What shocked me more, he has only dated south Asians and has many south asian friends. Second part of the date which I found really offensive, he kept saying I am fair for a south asian and he couldn't believe I wasn't mixed. Again another ignorant comment which I did politely reply saying you can't generalise a race on colour alone. I think I was just taken back on his ridiculous comments especially as he's a doctor. He's not my type but I wanted to be open minded to go on a date but I think it was clear after the constant comments about being exotic and fair, I wish I was brave enough to just leave but as I didn't want to be rude, I subjected myself to a very long uncomfortable evening. I left the date making sure I paid 50% and hope to never see him again. 

I kinda feel I probably should have said my mind at the end of the night so he's aware his behaviour and ignorance but also at the same time, I don't think it's my job to educate a man who grew up in London.",dating

I keep telling her not to think so unrealistically high of me, as she will always be disappointed. Let me set the scene for you, I’m in my early 20s, (she’s older than me) handsome and quiet. Yeah sounds all well and good, but let me add that I literally have nothing good going for me. I got fired from my job, lost my apartment, and I’m fricken poor as can be. I’m quite insecure about it. I also just don’t view myself as that great of a person. She’s so fricken nice, and pretty, and has a lot going for her. Idk why she would wanna mess around with someone like me. I am literally trash at everything, I’m trying to go back to school... I’m 90% guaranteed to fail. I just don’t think I have it in me to be successful. Don’t misconstrue me, I have ambitions higher than Everest, and I try. But it all blows up in my face, like literally always. I have two talents, I’m not even lying to you. I have two absolutely useless talents. Singing and sex. And no one cares about either of those. Yeah that stuff was cool when I was like 18. But now, none of that matters in the pursuit of anything meaningful. Other than that, I just kinda suck. I’m not asking for reassurance that I “can do anything I set my mind to.” Nah, I just wanna know what I should do because I like this girl but I know I have nothing good to bring to the table.",dating
660,Why is online dating more comfortable for women than dating their actual friends?,"This perplexes me so much as a guy. I'm not sure why this is the case?

Generally women I have found find it more comfortable meeting random strangers they met on dating apps or internet, then having a man pursue them in public places...

Example cases, friends in college.

I'm a college student. I've generally found that women would rather not or don't feel comfortable dating friends. 

I would think that would be the opposite. 

Isn't it nerve wracking as a woman to find strange men on dating apps? Why is online dating more comfortable for women in that sense?

I'm friends with girls in my life, in college, who act like it's a big deal for you to ask them out on dates or approaching them in public, but will have zero issues meeting randoms on the internet. 

As a man I never understood this. Maybe some women could help me be more understanding.",dating

Does such a thing exist? I understand this is sort of what ""FWB"" is supposed to be but my understanding is a man needs to be a tall ripped/beautiful supermodel to get one of those or just ridiculously lucky. I dunno.

We were taking a bath at a remote beach with no one about. She seemed concious about her own body. She told me she needed to loose some weight. Thats a little unsettling. I dont think she needs to loose weight at all. She is slim enough as she is. We both probably would benefit from getting more in shape. She dont have this perfect porn star body but I dont care about that. She is way above average both with her body, her smile, skin tone, personality and she knows how to dress well. She dont use makeup and she dont need to. I would still show her off to my friends. She got nothing to worry about. I think maybe we should work out together and get in shape both of us.

673,Why do Women (generally speaking) consider 6 packs to be attractive?," 

I am a straight Man, age 25, but even straight people can recognize someone attractive in their gender. And I just don't understand why most Women are into abs.

Now I admit part of it could be rooted in me not having abs. But I never bothered getting them because I never found them appealing. Quite the opposite. I find that body builder appearance fake and unatural. I think it is important to be healthy yes. I for example don't drink pop / alcohol, don't smoke. ride my bike and jog a lot, use stairs instead of elevators, not drive short distances, etc. I lead a healthy a lifestyle. Still overweight for some reason but working on it; trying to go from a belly (I look pregnant LOL) to something closer to 'normal' (a 'dad bod' I think it is called)

Personally, I am more attracted to Women who are smart and successful, Women with good morals, and Women who are Motherly, than Women who are physically attractive. Likewise, if I was a Woman, I'd be attracted to Men who are smart and successful, with good morals, and are Fatherly over Men who are physically attractive. But to me, a superficially / physically attractive Man is someone with certain physical features (many of which I don't have so this is not a 'cope') but a 6-pack is not one of them. I find that repulsive as it looks fake and unnatural. Healthy weight, yes is attractive (I admit I am much more attractive with my shirt on). But a 6-pack, I just don't see the appeal. And definitely don't see the appeal with a body builder's body. All those extra muscles just repeal me due to looking unnatural.",dating

675,I think everyone needs to understand this quote to dating,"Females a cursed with the responsibility of ATTRACTING men, while men are cursed with responsibility of PURSUING them.

I’m not saying it’s right, or fair, or even that it applys to every scenario. Just… this is how it has been for a long time. 

And this may be a bit controversial, but that’s why females are taught to have a huge focus on their looks from a young age, and guys are taught to do manly shit, like take risks, show courage, and lead romantic encounters. 

I’m sick of both sides not understanding the other sides pressure. Like approaching girls is a rough gig, while making sure you look perfect everyday and feeling insecure if you don’t is also a fucking rough gig (for girls).

I’m generalising like a mother fucker I know, but I just hope that both sexes can empathise with each other about this game of dating, instead of being so hurtful with throwing comments around like “that guy is weird, and isn’t charismatic at all” or “she focuses wayyy to much on her looks, 2hrs to get ready wtf?

676,Sort of asked out a girl at work and now I hate to run into her?,"So I stopped working on my college campus awhile ago and I had asked my female friend jokingly if she could ask out a girl for me. I didn’t expect her but to my surprise she asked for her Instagram and she told me that the girl said I was funny and cool, and that she would add my friend and I could add her from there.

They never exchanged information and the cringey part was that I THINK, I’m not sure if it’s actually her,  but I think I found her IG and sent in a follower request, but didn’t get a follow back. So I’m guessing she doesn’t like me which is fine, we were cordial and I would try to make her laugh when I did work there, but it was embarrassing to see her again. Usually I’m pretty good about shooting my shot, but I hate running into girls I’ve gone out on dates in the past, or girls I’ve asked out before (even if they said yes or no). 

We just said hi to each other and that was pretty much it, I’m probably not going to try to talk to her again and I don’t regret asking her out, but it’s just a reminder of being rejected. 

And my friends and I have a pretty good saying, we never clown on any of us when we go to ask out girls, and the saying is “shooters gotta shoot.” It’s basically saying if you gotta take chances in order to have a chance of success, but in this situation I feel like it backfired.

My friend is still saying that she’s shy and that she wouldn’t be surprised if I was direct then something could happen, (which she is pretty shy) but I said that I’d leave it at that unless she went out of her way to do something.",dating

679,Why are there a million dating sites for BBW but no good ones for big dudes.,"I just wanna put this out there and see what's said. I'm a 41 year old 6'2"" 275 to 290 depending on the day guy. I have been looking on line trying to find someplace that is directed to guys like me. I know there are women out there that like us big dudes but there isn't really a place I have found. If I'm wrong pl ease let me know. I have spent weeks actually months looking. Signed up for a hundred sites that seem like maybe but it always turns out to really be for bbw. I have no problem with bbws having places for them to find a guy. I get it I'm in same boat but it's extremely one sided from what I have seen. Why can't a big dude have someplace to find love too shit. I know for a fact that there alot more ladies out there that like them some big men. They don't have to be bbw or any other crazy acronym. Just normal everyday every size every walk of life women. Listen us big guys already get enough bad looks and stuff said behind our back that hurts. We already have to find clothes in big and tall or something like it. We have to squeeze into tiny airplane seats or cars. We already get the calls from friends to help move heavy shit all the time. We deal with a lot of shit most ""normal guys"" don't. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see good women with piece of shit ""normal guys"" because thats what they think they want and it's socially acceptable. I'll tell you this right now. Most of us big guys are way better human beings with bigger hearts and would be able to protect way better then these gym rats"" I did 1000 crunches today"". Good for you I ate 20 tacos today and can still out lift you. Wait wait wait ok I'm sounding negative toward them. If they like to work out more power to them. The ones I don't like are the ones that think they are God's gift and that they deserve to play women for fool and treat them like trash. So please except my apology decent gym rats lol. I'm just saying while the bad ones are lifting weights to attract more women they will just ruin for the rest of us.  Shit half the time those guys are smaller then the burrito I just ate. Look I know I'm not perfect I know my shape isn't the ideal model build but I guarantee any lady I'm with will have a smile on her face all day everyday if she would legitimately give it a chance. Most of us are that way. I get we may not be chiseled out of stone and have always been frowned on as unhealthy dirty sweaty and smelly. That's just not true for most of us. I am aware that I sweat after a hard day at work so take another shower it's not rocket science. Fact is that the way we get looked at treated and shunned by people just shows that we are not the ugly ones those of you who look at us disgusted those of you who snicker behind our back (which we hear clearly). Those of you who think your to good to give us a chance. Especially those of you who think you are any kind of better then we are. You my friends you are the ugly disgusting ones. Your the ones that give people depression problems, self esteem issues, cause good loving caring human beings commit suicide, and destroy the happiness of countless people that are 1000000 times better humans then you ever will be. But hey what do I know I'm just a lonely fat dude trying to find a site to maybe find love like everyone else has. Yet again for some reason there isn't. That's my rant let's see what's happens.

Loving someone or dating someone just because of the looks is like loving a movie just because of the special effects. Yeah, it can be entertaining but when the credits come you will end up with that feeling of emptiness and disappointment.  


There is something for everyone, but loving someone for what they are is how you can transcend the limitation of their special effect.

Be story-oriented, not special effect-oriented, they are just a bonus to enhance the story, but if you love the story your mind will make its own special effect.  


Credits always come and you should go for a satisfying journey no matter the end.",dating
684,Why do we prioritize dating?,"
Why don't we prioritize our goals and dreams the way we prioritize guys?

Is it because a partner make us feel happy emotions and euphoric? Our careers and goals can do the same.

You have one life to live. One life to make your dreams come true. They can't happen again. Time will pass.

But you have plenty of guys to choose from, who come and go. Saying bye to one does not mean saying bye to all, but saying bye to time you have now may mean saying bye to your future and dreams forever.

Guys are replaceable. Your future isn't.",dating

688,How to get a girl when you're ugly (as a Male),"From top to bottom:

* I got some freaky dry hair that sticks out like thin rice grains, that's hard to style;
* I got thick eyebrows;
* My eyes are big, and my upper eye lids are exposed and when there is no light around the upper lid is even covering half of my eye;
* My nose is asymmetrical, one nose hole is bigger than the other
* There's to much space between my nose and mouth, it looks a bit monkey;
* From ""XS"" to ""XL"", I got ""M"" lips, which doesn't fit the rest of my fenotype at all;
* I got 4 moles on my face, of which one is so big everyone would look me weirdly when they see me the first time;
* My facial bone structural is ok, and I would guess above average. My upper-body is more masculine than most boys out there.

What can I do? Dating apps is no option, because everyone instantly swipes right when they see my ugly face.

I see no other choice.

694,Guys when you get rejected. Here’s why you shouldn’t feel defeated... (This is my attempt to lift your spirits up),"

Alright...

(Skip to the last 2 paragraphs if tl;dr)

You see a pretty girl or guy. Nice eyes. Nice height. He looks like he can give very good sex as well as give good time. Your expectations rise.

You approach them and then they have a good personality. You begin to like them so you ask their number to talk more. Things get very nervous because your expectations are high whether you want to or not.
Your expectations are high because you like this person and you can’t act like they aren’t because that will just make you feel more awkward or nervous.

The more you like this person the more the desire to be with this person. Sometimes it becomes so strong because you truly like this person that you try to avoid any “hard truth” this is completely normal, i experience this too. 

This just shows you how much you value this person.

Most people who are cool about it or cold or super confident are usually people looking for sex. They’ve put everyone in the same pedestal so there concept of “special one” doesn’t exist because they’re out to feed their sexual desires or any other casual social desire.

Everyone experiences excitement and nervousness when we are really close to something we value. 
Think of it as an instinct that shows yourself that you **really** want it, and that once you’ll get it you’ll protect it and value it and take care of it. 

This can be dangerous though. Before you develop feelings for someone you need to analyse them and make an understanding of how they interact with their environment and friends, if they have any. 
I usually prevent myself from reaching this stage as I realise the people are like are generally immature and unwilling to learn.

Okay. So you now like this person and see them as good. Now you’re on your way to a romantic relationship with them.

Disaster strikes, they reject you.

Don’t be sad. 
It’s not really the person you’ve lost. It’s what they could have offered you that you’ve lost. You tell yourself that you liked this person but you actually liked their traits and aspects in them.

Now recognize that there are millions of people you’ll walk by who some of them can offer you if not better experiences. Who might have just as admirable qualities as the specific person you wanted.",dating

So aggressive, passionate, bold, can barely keep his hands of me, and so so so so very eager to get both of us off while he whispers some of the most dirtiest things in my ear with animalistic grunts and groans.

But then when we are not in bed he’ll cuddle with me, buy me chocolate, give me some of the sweetest smiles, offer me melatonin because he knows I have trouble sleeping, hold my hand in car, make sure I am eating properly, and rub my back affectionately give me some of the sweetest good night kisses.

696,How to Make a Woman Want You Sexually," Making a woman want you sexually is easier said than done. There are so many things that can go wrong while you are trying to make your girl sexually want you. There are chances that she might not look at you the same way you look at her, or she might not see more than a friend in you. And as long as a woman does not feel sexually attracted to you, she would not be able to be in a sexual relationship with you. Sexual attraction is one of the most significant factors that can make a woman want to have sex with you. This ultimate guide to attract women is sure to teach you some ways to make that girl go gaga over you. Without further ado, let us plunge into more interesting details. 

**Make her feel sexually attracted to you** 

If you want the girl of your dreams to be sexually attracted to you, you should avoid being too friendly and overbearing. If you fail to create a sense of sexual attraction, she might not fell the need to be loyal to you. She will most likely continue to sleep with other people whom she is sexually attracted to. So, bring out your charm and let that girl know your dirtiest sexual desires. 

**Portray a masculine vibe** 

Girls are not looking for boys; they are looking for men these days. One of the easiest ways to make a girl want you sexually is to make her feel feminine in comparison to your masculine vibe around her. If you can be calm, confident, and collected around her, she is most likely to fall for her in a jiffy. Learn how to approach a woman and entice her to the core. 

**Try coyly brushing your cheek, chin or nose against the side of her face while whispering something in her ear**

This is one of the easiest and the simplest ways to make a woman feel aroused. She is most likely to feel excited by the whisper and the physical contact of your face brushing against hers. She is sure to feel attracted to you if you are funny and can whisper something funny in her ear. 

**Don’t tell her that you have feelings for her unless she is very attracted to you**

This can scare any woman easily. Even when you are in love with her, you must wait for the right moment to be out with it. If she only feels mild levels of attraction for you, she won't be very thrilled about the fact that you like her. There are chances that she might thank you for the compliment and get on with her life. And there can nothing be worse than this. 

These tips are sure to help you make the girl of your dreams sexually attracted to you. ",dating

First off, I really don't care who judges me for dating girls who are younger than I am, but I do want people's opinion on this matter. So here is my deal... I have always dated younger girls than myself, anywhere from 1 year difference (I was 21 and she was 20) all the way to a 9 year difference (I was 28 and she was 19) and everything in between. I like dating younger because as a man I like the fact that I'm more experienced in life, I am a provider, I am their protector and they are fun. Now I'm 36 and and I'm ready to settle down and find ""the one"" who I'll spend the rest of my life with and have a family with. The problem is that recently I've been criticized by older women on my choice to date younger than me, mostly by my friend's 41 year old wife! She wants to hook me up with one of her ""approved"" friends which they all have kids and are either single mothers, or divorced. I'm not down with that, I've date divorced with kids before and I'm good on that, I learned my lesson. I'm looking more like a 26-30 year old who would want to (and is able to) have kids and start a family. I know what I want and that seems to be a problem for some people, mostly women. Why? I say live and let live. Also, I always seem to attract older women 38+ and BIGGER women, mostly divorced with kids. I'm sorry but that's not my cup of tea. It's like these women just expect me to settle for whatever they throw at me, no thank you. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks.",dating

708,Bf (34) says my weight gain has stopped him from having sex with me (f30),"EDIT: My cheating was in no way physical or sexual. I formed an emotional connection with an old friend. That’s it. We’ve worked through it and he has assured me that it has no bearing on the current issue at hand and that my weight is 95% the problem.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 15 years now. The last 6 years we haven’t had sex ONCE. As with all relationships, I expected a decline and not an abrupt stop. To give a little background - I have cheated on him once (not sexually though) about 8/9 years back and he was in a stressful work environment when the decline started. 

There would be weeks where I’d try and initiate and he would turn me down time after time. This eventually had an impact on my self esteem and I stopped initiating. I’ve asked countless times if I was the problem and he would just say no and that he has a low libido.

Fast forward to a few months back, I found porn on his phone and started monitoring this. He was watching religiously every week sometimes multiple times a week. 

I’ve confronted him about this and explained that even though the porn is not a problem, I do however have a problem that we’re in a long term relationship and basically celibate.

He confessed that “I have let myself go” and that it’s a turn off. I have picked up weight since we started dating (from about 90kgs to 115 at my heaviest). During this time I had to deal with a job loss, chronic illness and depression which contributed to the weight gain. He has changed in so many ways as well and I accept him as he is.

I feel like I’m willing to work on myself (currently eating healthier and working out and have lost about 6kgs so far) but I feel pressured to look a certain way and that I have to compete with pornstar standards. This has made me resent him and I don’t think I’d ever feel comfortable having sex with him again. 

Am I being dramatic or does he have a valid point?",dating

So as I (17M) already found out that the Queen died an hour before, and was very distraught as I’ve always loved the royal family and realized the historical significance she had but also i feel that this year is bound  to get worse. Keep in mind, that i already felt like shit and wanted to cry legitimately about the news; and as im having to push and slug myself to complete the days work in my economics class. I hear the friend of the girl i liked (18/19F) saying “the queen just died” and she yelped out a large “muahahahahree” like if she was golem from Lord of the Rings. She slammed her hands down on her desk as if she was Patrick from SpongeBob dramatically laughing and at that moment, my heart dropped and my interest in that girl died at that instance. I dont even want to look at her anymore so yes, i lost my interest in her but sadly in the worst way possible.

Tldr; I (17M) realized im glad i didnt move forward and try to go out with a girl i liked (18/19F) as soon as i heard her snarl and vehemently laugh and jester at the Queens death.

EDIT: yes, this is serious. Im only doing this to express how relieved i am, and we really need to start sharing red flags more and being able to recognize those.

I however never get matched with girls with a similar body type to myself or even just an “average” body type.

712,Women need to stop crapping on short guys,"I see it all the time when women comment that they've been with a short guy, you seem to generalize us off 1 short guy or a few. Its like as if one short guy thats an ass basically means short guys as a whole are assholes, at least thats  the vibe I get from women. I've seen a lot of comments, **especially from certain short women who love bad-mouthing short guys** that we're basically hot-headed assholes that try to cover up our insecurities and that we aren't basically allowed to feel what we feel. Our feelings are abnormal. We can't feel upset, sad, depressed, w/e at any point and if we do it seems like we are a bad candidate for women. At all times its like we have to put on a fake image for women to see. It might not even be about height and we might have other shit going on in our lives that we're just not in the right mood and for w/e reason some jackass seems to play that out that its our own fault for feeling like that.

Its like if we have someone in our lives that we lost or w/e we aren't allowed to feel that way and it somehow comes across as ""insecurity"" but god forbid we feel pissed off and upset at the treatment we get. We're just supposed to dance around in glee and pretend that we are happy as fuck, but in reality we aren't based on the shit we get from other people especially women. To the women that actually say good shit about us, god bless you, but the negativity is rampant based off certain short men that are assholes so I guess we all are.

The bullshit we get is irritating from other people. Just realize one thing, as short men we are allowed to feel what we want to feel. No one can tell us how to feel and our feelings are valid. Don't fucking play it out as us being our own enemies because in most cases its not, other people are. You don't live our lives, you aren't in our own shoes. The only ones that can understand us is short men themselves and women have no idea what its like to be a short man at all nor will they ever. Every feeling that a short man gets is completely acceptable for a tall guy. A short man thats an asshole gets ridiculed, a tall man thats an asshole gets women and its perfectly fine.

715,Suddenly she hates giving me oral sex,"tl:dr - My ex girlfriend suddenly decided to stop give me oral sex, even when I return the favor.

It was a while ago when I dated this girl, we broke up a long time ago but every now and then I find myself thinking about our relationship, and wondering what could have lead her to this ""decision"", we had a serious relationship (at that point in time we already been dating for almost 2 years) and we loved each other very much, had great chemistry, until one day she told me she doesn't like to go down on me ""everytime we have sex""
From then it turned to no oral sex at all, when I asked her about it she used to say she never actually liked doing it which was a lie, because I KNOW she enjoyed doing it, she was SUPER passionate about it for most of our relationship.
I always kept myself clean, showered before having sex, and also well shaved, I always went down on her, even when the smell wasn't perfect, I still did and never ever thought about removing it from the ""list"", safe to say she expected oral sex but won't return the favor.
But again, she suddenly dropped this bomb which made me feel disgusting about myself, I considered this a deal breaker, we broke up a while ago.
I would not expect too much oral sex if it's just a fling, but in a serious relationship I would take that as if the girl is not attracted to me enough.

716,"Men’s advice. If you want to be more than just a friend, then stop acting like her friend on dates. Don’t be ashamed of being sexual","Have you ever gone on a date with someone, and you seemingly had great chemistry, the conversation flowed, you both laughed, she even mentioned during or after the date that’s he had a great time. Then inexplicably, a few days later, she becomes less responsive, and finally you get the “I have to be honest” text. She says she thinks you’re a great guy, but she didn’t feel any chemistry and she hopes you can be friends.

Most guys are utterly confused by this, but if they were grounded in reality and observant, they would have seen it coming.

Having a good time and getting along doesn’t translate into romantic feelings. She saw you as a friend because you acted like one. You were too agreeable, you didn’t look at her with desire, you didn’t playfully tease her, you didn’t use subtle touch around her. You muted your sexual energy around her for the sake of being polite.

This is a common theme of the Nice Guy. They are ashamed of their masculine sexuality, and believe that acting in an asexual manner is what will win a woman’s respect, that is what society has conditioned him to believe.

What he fails to understand is that being sexual and being respectful aren’t mutually exclusive. Being lustful is where things become unbalanced, inappropriate comments are made, her personal space is invaded before you build comfort.

Even in the early stages of getting to know her, act more like her boyfriend than her friend. If you haven’t kissed, hooked up or had sex by the second or third date, unless she has a religious or spiritual reason to remain celibate, you are on a direct path to Friendville. Lack of touch or physical intimacy is the biggest indicator of lack of romantic interest or improper calibrated escalation.

A romantic relationship is friendship with the added element of sexuality and sexual attraction. Keep this in mind when you’re dating and feel a sense of shame for your desire.",dating
717,How can someone be confident when they are treated so poorly by women?,"I always hear this shit but how can someone be confident when you get very few likes on tinder, or get rejected, even though everything seems fine about you.",dating
718,Should women date less attractive men?,"My friend sent me a study done a few years ago about how attractive women were happier dating less attractive men. They felt they were happier because what the men lacked in looks they made up for in kindness, gifts, trying to romance their partner etc. A guy I was talking to about this thinks that from the men’s perspective -that men and women think about sex differently. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. He said that men who never really had to try hard to get women’s attention took women’s attention for granted and if women gave them attention easily the guy was more inclined to look at women as sex objects or if a relationship didn’t work out have the mindset of “well I can always get a new one”. He said he didn’t feel that in general women really looked at men like this. I have no idea if there’s a difference there. He thought the key to finding a good man is to find one who is less attractive who will view you as “his prize” and work hard to not take you for granted. 

However some women think that dating down in terms of looks is doing a disservice to yourself. You will be dating someone who you aren’t attracted to or at least initially and have to work to develop an attraction to them. Sometimes men can get resentful (and we can see it here on Reddit a lot) when they are rejected by women over and over. They may develop a mindset of “I’m going to get revenge” or develop FOMO if they suddenly become more attractive to women either by wealth, losing weight, etc, and leave the woman they have in the dust for someone more attractive to make up for lost time-if they are superficial (which is sometimes hard to tell if your dating someone who is superficial unless they say things that make it obvious). Also dating someone less attractive may lead to insecurity for the other person. 

I usually have dated less attractive men then me. I found their personalities seemed to be better. However one downside was that they seemed to be insecure whenever I received attention from other men and I had to assure them more. A couple became to the point of becoming controlling and abusive, but this could happen with any guy regardless of looks .Thoughts?",dating
719,Wondering why men are so sexual early on? It's because men are adapting to feminism,"I see a lot of women get irritated that men just hit them up for sex. 

Why? Are you surprised?

Most men already know that you don't want to settle in your 20s.

Most men know that the idea of marriage repulses most women in their 20s.

Seriously....how many of you ladies actually want to take on a traditional relationship/marriage? Let's be honest, most of you ladies want to just ""explore"" the field and exercise your empowerment. Fair enough.

With all of that being said, men are adapting to the fact that women don't want to commit to us in their 20s. Why would we invest so much time and energy into getting to know you when we know that you are just gonna be clubbing every weekend, dancing all over random dudes? You ladies were the ones who asked to be treated like pieces of meat. So enjoy it.",dating

721,Men are too logical for their own good,"As a man, I think that other men, especially men on reddit, have a tendency to be too “logical” for their own good. The amount of articles and statistics and graphs and data that get shared over and over again to try and justify or explain men being at a **supposed** disadvantage in dating is exhausting. At this point, we’ve all heard these regurgitated talking points:

“Dating apps skew 75% (or higher) male.”

“Women only go for the top 1% of men.”

“33% of men haven’t had sex in the last year.”

“Men take who they can get. Women have so many options and they all want the same top tier guy.”

The list goes on. I honestly believe that if more men stopped looking for data to back up their preconceived biases to explain why they’re not having the most dating success, they’d feel better about themselves rather than carrying around this constant mindset that the dating landscape is against them because they’re a man.

I get it. It’s disappointing to not succeed with a lot of the women you talk to. It’s disappointing to open up a dating app and see barely any new likes or matches. I’m not saying that none of the data is true, but constantly falling back on it as a go-to for why some men do better than others in dating is just annoying to see all the time in forums and threads.

It gets even worse when men give these stats to women as if to say “See? Look at these numbers! You’re only having problems with dating because you’re making poor choices!” The horrible, blanket assumption that women’s dating woes could be solved simply by “dating an average guy” is comical at this point.",dating
722,The vast majority of men are looking for committed relationships. If only interact men that don’t that says more about the quality of men you’re picking than it does about men.,"I get what TV and movies say, most men aren’t looking for a quick fuck and then to ghost you. This isn’t to say there aren’t any men that want to do so but, honestly like four out of five of guys want an actual relationship.

If you constantly only interact with guys that fuck you then never call you again, I question if you’re a good judge of character. For example, I have a nose like a bloodhound for gold diggers and sex workers. From maybe a conversation with one, I know what they’re after. It isn’t that hard. You can even tell sometimes by what they look like. 

The guys that like to pump and dump also have a very telling look and unfortunately it’s a look that attracts a shit ton of women. Maybe avoid those type of guys, after all personality is what matters the most right?Learn to recognize the signs before you get played.",dating
723,The main reason for peoples dating problems is not complicated but it is depressing,"So many people post on here about dating woes women and men and over complicate it. It literally all breaks down to the same shit 98% of the time. And it’s cruel and people don’t want to accept it. 

When women complain about a guy leaving them or not committing, it’s always (unless there were severe compatibility issues / psycho shit) based around the same reason. The guy found someone hotter. Or the guy just doesn’t find you that attractive and dated you for convenience and regular sex. I’ve seen guys do this innumerable amounts of times. This is also usually the case because women tend to “date up” so the guys are usually out of their league (hence the lack of commitment) and can in fact find other women easily.  A top tier guy most of the time will only commit for the long haul with a really hot ass woman but he’ll def fuck around with you and use you for sex if your only average or below average looking. Cold hard truth. 

When men complain about women leaving, it’s literally for the same reason, but you could add in maybe the other guy has more money/status. If women don’t want to date you, it’s because they get hotter guys than you on a regular basis so you don’t really exist to them at all. (Cough, Tinder.) Women don’t need to date less attractive men to get sex. They can get sex literally anytime and from men probably more attractive than you. 90% of men do not exist to women at all. If you don’t get a ton of matches on tinder, their algorithm has literally told you scientifically, you are in the bottom 90%. The top 10% of men DO get a shitload of matches, trust me I’ve seen it, the disparity is monstrous (aka average guy gets 0-3 matches a month from let’s be honest, bots, transvestites, obese single mothers, hot guy gets 100s of matches a month from every single quality of woman, it’s not even remotely proportionate. Cold hard truth. 

The reality is the dating world is narcissistic and cruel. In a much more hyper and exaggerated way than it was say 25 years ago (before social media and online dating). The reality is your expectations don’t match what you’re able to garner. You’re reaching. People leave, don’t commit or don’t match with you because they have better options than you, or at least believe they do. Are there outlier examples to my reasoning? Yes, obviously, but this seems to ring true for the vast, I mean vast, majority of the time.",dating
724,Women Want Sex Just As Much As Men," Although we have come pretty far as a society in understanding that women are just as sexual as men, the cliché still exists that when it comes to desires men have more of them and more often, too.

727,How to date someone you are not physically attracted to?,"I'm 20M, have been dating a 21F for 2 months.

She's super, ultra sweet, unfailingly kind, quite smart, funny, is interested in a lot of weird/cool shit that she has introduced me to. I really like her as person.

Only issue is that I'm not visually attracted to her. Met her on Hinge, she liked one of my prompts (only like/match I've ever gotten), spoke for a bit, went onto IG, met for coffee. We've been to a lot of different places since then, done a lot of different things. Really cool person. At first, I wasn't even comfortable with her touching me, but now, I have become so. But the thought of kissing her or anything more, makes me feel uneasy. 

We were talking on IG, she kinda asked me why I haven't made a move with a ""haha"". I told her that I like taking it slow because I didn't know what else to say. But it was fairly clear that she didn't really digest that bit very well, so I'm pretty sure she's about to check out unless I make a move asap.

I know this is horrible, super shallow, and immature, to care about looks, but I want to work on that and get past it. I know it sounds like I'm asking for a deadline extension or something like that, but I think I can get myself attracted to her if I get another month or two.

739,This is how you become a naturally confident & attractive man,"Hey guys.

Just wanted to share an idea with you that might help you with your inner game.

So there's a pretty common notion in entrepreneurship that says:

***""The shittier the product, the bigger the advertising budget""***

If the product is shit, people won't write great reviews and refer their friends. They won't stick around or come back. And without sinking tons of money into advertising on a regular basis, that product will sink.

But how does this apply to dating?

Well if I re-wrote the above quote for dating/seduction it would be...

***""The more unhappy, anxious, needy or insecure you are, the more you need techniques/systems to convince her otherwise""***

I know this is pretty common knowledge in this community. But it still baffles me when I come across ""accomplished"" pick-up artists who got there by developing cringey systems of seduction, only to still be utterly miserable (For example, Todd V and Mystery both look tired and depressed these days IMO).

To me, techniques, tactics & systems reek of unresolved trauma, repressed emotions, insecurity, fear and a desperate need to win her affection and *control* the outcome.

I want you to be an emotionally healthy, genuinely confident, sexually **wanted** man WITHOUT feeling like you need to memorise a boatload of confusing bullshit.

**So what do I recommend as an alternative?**

Well, in a nutshell, it boils down to walking the long road of becoming a naturally attractive man who women choose. This is the road that most men avoid but when you walk it, you change forever.

**This man:**

* Doesn't need to prowl the streets like some sex-starved adolescent, because women are throwing him signals all over the place as he goes about his day.
* He accepts himself just as he is.
* He embraces his sexuality, his insecurities and his shortcomings.
* He also KNOWS what he brings to the table, and doesn't need anyone to tell him.
* He loves his life and he loves himself.

You don't get there by memorising systems, openers, negs or the perfect escalation ladders. That shit just reconfirms the false belief that you're worth fuck all without them.

***You get there by doing the real work on your trauma.***

You address the root of your emotional neediness and the bullshit beliefs about your own worthiness and desirability. You slowly let go of that 60kg pack of shame you drag into every one of your approaches.

Do you have to stop approaching while you do this? Of course not. In fact, action is essential.

I'm just saying that if you're obsessing over the perfect system of seduction or the ideal ""method"" to get ANY woman into bed with you in 5 seconds or less - you're probably being sold to by a coach who needs you to believe that all you lack is his system.

You're majoring in the minor.

The reality is, you are okay just as you are.

You just don't believe it. You read those words and you can't comprehend it through your shame tinted goggles. Your experiences and conditioning have told you that you're just not enough and you're looking for a woman who will tell you otherwise.

Despite being enough just as you are, you have work to do.

**So here's what you can do now to start becoming that shameless, confident natural...**

1. Write your life story from start to present.
2. Join a men's group and start unpacking the shit you're carrying.
3. Cut out distractions and practice sitting alone in silence for 30 minutes a day.
4. Write 3 pages of incoherent brain dump in a journal every morning.
5. Stare into a mirror for 5 minutes every so often and let yourself feel whatever comes up.

This isn't an exhaustive list at all. I still pretty much guarantee though that if you started implementing the above, you would notice a deep shift in your confidence within a couple of months.

Anyway, that's all I've got right now. Thanks for reading.

And good luck on your journey, men.

740,Don’t shoot your shot.,"From perhaps the beginning of modern dating, what are men told whenever they have taken interest in a woman?

“Go up to her.”    “Make a move.”     “Shoot your shot.”    “Ask her out.”    “The worst she can say is no.”  

Men are told this from both other men and women. And yet, it’s terrible advice. Why? Because men seem to have gotten the idea into their head that even if there’s no indication that a woman is interested in them, and that she’ll probably reject him, he should still make his own interest clear, as a matter of practice. And that just leads to negative consequences for both sides.

Rejecting a man isn‘t a whole lot of fun for a woman. Because many women feel absolutely no attraction to the man asking them out, they certainly don’t want to agree to any date. Yet they feel like it’s rude/mean to do so, which puts them in a sticky spot. It’s also pretty annoying to have to coddle the ego of some man. When the man who is formally making overt moves on her isn‘t someone she knows well, she‘ll probably feel some lack of safety out of fear of how this man will react when she says no. And when the man *is* someone she knows well, she‘ll probably feel annoyed at how someone who she thought was just a normal person in her life was just another man who sees her as a love interest instead of how she saw them.

Of course, being rejected as a man isn’t a walk in the park, either. Being rejected is of course a disappointment on the person being rejected. Being rejected can be a pretty big blow to someone’s self-esteem- not when it happens just once, but when failure happens relentlessly after every attempt, it takes a toll on someone. And it makes him feel foolish as well. Not only did the other person find you unattractive- but you were actually foolish enough to believe they didn’t! Additionally, being rejected over and over again isn’t a good look. It makes someone appear to be desperate, unable to find someone who‘s interested, and not very self-aware. It does no good to be rejected, except in a “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger“ sense.

A lot of the time a man asks a woman out, they aren’t strangers- they’re good friends or acquaintances who were building a relationship with each other. And when the man tells the woman she’s interested, but she doesn’t feel the same way, it can put a huge damper on the company that they probably enjoyed between each other. Sometimes, it can be repaired. But other times, it totally ends what could’ve otherwise been a great, mutually beneficial relationship had the man kept his feelings to himself.

So no, men, don’t shoot your shot just because you’re interested and she’s single. I know this advice goes against everything you’ve probably been told, but trust me- for the sake of both you and her, unless she’s made some some clear signs she’s interested, keep your feelings to yourself.

TL;DR Men shouldn’t ask out women whenever they are interested because rejections helps absolutely no one and should be avoided. Men should only approach if their are clear signs that the women is interested.",dating

743,Is it a red flag when a guy asks if you can cook on the first date?,"I kinda think it is, like they're trying to suss out what you can do for them.

744,Guys that are bad at sex,"So I have two issues with dating involving sex. For one, I find that a lot of men I’ve gone on dates with try to have sex with me right away which is a red flag if I have said I want to take things slow and I’m looking for a relationship. I know some people have different opinions on this, but I am looking for a guy who isn’t into casual hook ups and this is just how I weed those guys out. I believe that having sex too soon can ruin things for people too, and allows them to focus on sex instead of whether or not the two people are a good match. There are people who will let sex cloud their judgement about a person, and it just muddies things up for some people. 

However, waiting too long to have sex can present another issue. What if I wait awhile to get to know the guy, I’m satisfied that he’s not just after sex, and then I hate having sex with him.  I feel that around 90 percent of men I’ve had sex with I did not enjoy having sex with them. I talk to other women, and they often have the same experiences. Some women aren’t that sexual and could care less about how big a guys penis is or how long he lasts in bed, but for women who do care I hear it’s a problem. For me the problem is that I find that most guys I have had sex with last under 5 minutes in bed. Sometimes it’s been up to ten minutes but never more than that except for 2 men out of all the the guys I’ve been with. It’s disappointing because then after I have to say well, I guess it’s on to the next one. 

From doing some reading I read stats that say for most women it takes 20 minutes for them to have an orgasm while it takes men anywhere from 2-10 minutes. I usually give guys a few chances like up to 6 chances probably before I decide that they are just not going to last very long in bed ever . I feel bad talking to them about it because I don’t want to make them feel horrible if it’s out of their control. But I also feel bad ghosting a guy after sex. When in the past I talked to a couple guys about it and asked if they could read about fixing it like whether it be jerking off more, etc. nothing worked. Usually the men I’ve slept with who don’t last very long sometimes also have issues with maintaining an erection. I read that the two can go hand in hand and that this is becoming a big issue with men. Health issues like stress, being over weight, and blood pressure issues can contribute to this so it can be a very common problem. To make matters worse lots of men don’t even see a problem in these issues and don’t even try to satisfy women in bed. 

I have talked to other women to find out how I can vet men for these issues before I sleep with them and the consensus has been that I can’t . I thought maybe giving a handjob first could work, but then I realized that a handjob is very different than sex and from talking to guys men can last a lot longer from them. And talking about it first doesn’t help either because lots of men will just lie about their Dick size and bedroom skills. So I guess I just have to have sex with them to find out. I guess if women want guys that don’t have small penises and also have stamina, we should be dating black guys. Which also hasn’t worked out great for me. So even a thing like my sexual preferences, which are only a small part compared to other things I value in a man, makes me feel like I will never meet a man who matches my standards. If I can’t even meet a man who can sexually satisfy me, other parts of having a relationship are less appealing. I can take care of myself, I have a vibrator, I have friends to keep me entertained….so why should I want to date? This is something I ask myself whenever I try dating. I guess I am just venting about it but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with these issues let me know.",dating

After about about a week and a half of talking to this F[19] from my school we hit it off pretty quick and we winded up sleeping with each other even though she knows what kind of guy I am and what I want. The next day she starts texting me and i don’t respond which I do to almost all the girls after I sleep with them. But after 23 texts o had to respond and tell her to stop and that she needs to leave me alone, and that’s when it started. In a 2 week time span she went back to all the girls I had slept with and told them crazy things like I forced her to do things she didn’t want and that I’m some kind of lunatic who cares nothing about women and so on. So all the girls I had slept with in the past agreed with her and started saying I did similar things to them like force them to sleep with me off rip and other things.  They are really trying to ruin me and it’s getting worse what do I do",dating
746,Why do so many people paint women like they are all extremely shallow creatures that only care about dating guys that are above their station?,"
I see where these people are coming from. I have gotten rejected a gazillion times and have myself spiral down in the depression and anger pitt which leads on hating on women to release some steam off. 

However, I have met really cool girls that are nothing like what many people here complain about “the nature of women”. Which is super stupid since no 2 humans are the same. 

What I am thinking is that the cool girls are not as loud as the not-so-cool ones and therefore are not as noticeable if one does not take the time to get to know them. Therefore, these not-so-cool girls tend to be all these people see. 

Also, based on my experience the nice girls that I have met are super busy with their careers to be partying in clubs and they hate online dating. 

I feel that many people here had the bad luck of getting a really shitty sample, and that is why they hold their negative  views.

I repeat, no 2 humans are the same. Every member of my family is so different from one another. All of my friends are different as well. We all have different views including the kind of girls that we find attractive and what we want in a girl. 

I have met guys that disgust me with their cheating and machismo, and I have met feminazis that I hate because they make me feel terrible for the sole crime of have been born a guy.

If I just generalized entire genders based on my bad experiences then I wouldn't talk to anyone at all because people from both genders have hurt me and disappointed me more times than I can remember.

The human brain loves shortcuts to save energy. Generalizations are an easy, but highly flawed way of humans to make sense of the world and others. Just please be aware of this, have an open mind and know that everyone is different.

And the statements “Women are x and like x” and “Men are y and like y” are always flawed due to our differences. 

As a wise guy once said: “All generalizations are false, including this one.” - Mark Twain",dating

Everything is stacked against me on tinder. I can’t fix my photos to beat the 6 and 7 guys. I can’t fix my facial aesthetic and go up 2 or 3 whole points. That just doesn’t happen.

748,Just remembered my worst date and decided to share,"Basically, we went to see a movie - Spider-Man far from home. It was not going great as she kind of arrived late for the movie and a lot of other stupid uncalled for things. But what takes the prize was when the movie ended and I was trying to make small talk. So here is this girl telling me she really likes Marvel movies. Especially Spider-Man. So I ask her, ""Oh, that is so cool! Me too! How did you find this movie? Good? Bad? Decent? Also, which Spider-Man movie franchise do you prefer?"" and she hits me back with ""There are more movies!?""

So yeah, I guess she was trying to fake it till she makes it. But you know what is worse than telling me you do not like what I like? Faking it and getting caught!

Anyway, I hope this could be a funny story for someone to read today. Don't sweat it! Bad dates just happen. Also, before someone starts telling me how that should not matter, don't worry, this was not the nail in the coffin.",dating
749,6 Reasons Why Dating an Introvert Is Better,"**What is it like dating an introvert?**  
Well, back when I first started looking for love, I noticed that one of my extroverted friends had a very different style than I did when it came to dating. He enjoyed staying out late at bars and clubs, and he was not shy at all about broaching sexual topics with women he had just met.

That’s not me at all. As an introverted man, I’m reserved and gentle. I believe that it’s more respectful to wait at least a little while before becoming physically intimate with someone. However, after watching my friend have several successful romantic encounters, I started to worry that I had to be more like him if I wanted to find love. Was his extroverted personality more suitable for dating? Was my introverted personality a curse on my love life?  
Turns out, being an introvert is not a curse at all. Introverts have a lot of unique advantages when it comes to love. Here are six reasons it can be better to date an introvert.

**Advantages of Dating an Introvert**

**1. Introverts cultivate deep, meaningful relationships.**  
Introverts prefer to connect deeply with a chosen few people rather than maintain surface-level relationships with many acquaintances. We tend to be polite and sincere, and this helps us make meaningful connections. The extrovert I mentioned earlier has an address book filled with women’s phone numbers. He’s had a lot of hookups and short-term flings. On the other hand, I take my time when getting to know someone romantically. Even though he’s gone out with more women than me, ultimately, my relationships last longer.

**2. We tend to listen well and be perceptive of others.**  
Our powerful ability to listen helps our significant other feel heard. We notice small things, such as what our partner likes, how they’re feeling, and which kinds of gestures mean the most to them. We understand what makes them tick, and we’re naturally good at stepping into their shoes and seeing things from their point of view. Because of this, it’s easy for us to make our partner feel loved in the ways that mean the most to them.

**3. We build strong emotional connections.**  
We tend to stay away from shallow small talk and impersonal banter about the weather. Instead, many introverts enjoy discussing more meaningful topics such as what gets us out of bed in the morning, our thoughts on the latest Game of Thrones episode, or whether Team Iron Man or Team Captain America should have won. We share our hopes and dreams, and we’re good at getting our significant other to do the same. We’re naturally good at making the conversation more personal and creating emotional intimacy.

**4. We tend to be calm during conflict.**  
Introverts generally know how to keep their cool, which can be an incredible gift in the midst of conflict. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, Susan Cain recalls her experience as a Wall Street lawyer representing a client who had trouble repaying a loan and was hoping to negotiate new terms against nine angry bankers and their lawyer. Describing herself in the third person, Cain writes, “She rarely spoke without thinking. Being mild-mannered, she could take strong, even aggressive, positions while coming across as perfectly reasonable.” Instead of trying to be louder or more dominant than her opposition, she remained calm in the meeting, which helped reduce the tension in the room and ultimately won her the day.

**5. We’re often deliberate and reflective**.  
Because many of us were teased or bullied about our quiet ways growing up, we know just how hurtful words can be. We understand that they can leave deep, invisible cuts that may never heal completely. And, the wrong thing said in the heat of the moment can never be taken back. Introverts tend to be less impulsive in this regard.  
As Cain explains in Quiet, Professor Kagan of the Laboratory for Child Development at Harvard observed that a group of five hundred infants could be divided into two groups, “high-reactive” and “low-reactive,” based on their reaction to stimuli such as recorded voices or balloons popping. The high-reactive children — that is, the ones who reacted more when surrounded by other people and loud noises — would turn out to be introverts. Kagan observed that these children tended to spend more time considering all the alternatives when presented with a choice and therefore made less impulsive decisions.

**6. Introverts understand and accept people for who they are.**  
Introverts live in an extroverted world, so we know what it’s like to have to play a role. Often, we have to put on a mask and act more extroverted than we really are in order to fit in. We understand what it’s like to be misunderstood, so in turn, we often offer understanding and acceptance to the people in our lives.

For us, a Friday night spent watching Netflix in our pajamas is an awesome night. Small talk is a form of torture. A rainy afternoon spent indoors is just as beautiful as a sunny day spent outdoors. And our favorite thing about partying is able to go home afterwards!

When we find someone who understands and appreciates us for who we are, we cherish those people, whether they are a peace-loving introvert or rowdy extrovert.",dating
750,"Is it just me, or does there seem to be a clear relationship between the age and attractiveness of the women and the chance she contacts me again?","I'm bombarded with stuff like ""its all subjective"", ""depends on the person"", ""looks is not why you get rejected"", etc.

&#x200B;

but I can't help but notice that ALL EVIDENCE points otherwise.

I've been on probably 75-100 dates. There is one CLEAR pattern I have noticed, and I feel like I am taking crazy pills because people seem to fight on these this one thing.

&#x200B;

\-The younger  the girl, the higher propability that she will not want to see you (not match, not continue talking, flake, not want to see you on the next date). This part is pretty obvious, but the most striking thing is that her behavior is INDEPENDENT of how good the date/interaction went. good dates still lead to ghosting.

\-the more attractive the women, the higher the probability that she will not want to see you as well. again, the most striking this is that her wanting to see you is completely indepedent on how the date/interaction went.

&#x200B;

**this EASILY explains a lot of inconsistent behaviors I've seen. namely:**

&#x200B;

Going on a ton of great dates with younger/attractive women, that end with a kiss/makout/sex, only to see her ""change her mind later"".

Going on a ton of poor dates with women that were not so attractive/older, little chemistry/etc, or I was just plain nervous/etc. and having them want to see you again and text all the time.

&#x200B;

these are CLEAR patterns I've noticed. the usually rebuttel I get is ""well maybe you were more nervous and acted differently because you were intimidated by the attractive women"". that's a great theory, but  doesnt account for the poor dates I've had with women who were older/less attractive that ended up wanting to see me again.

&#x200B;

It just boggles my mind that people don't notice this, or are so quick to throw out the ""looks don't really matter, it was your personality that was the issue"".

and for the record, I'm not trying to offend any women here with comparing older/younger attractive/less attractive. Its just Ive noticed that these are the biggest factors, and I need to point them out for my story to make sense.",dating
751,Isn't the end goal of dating....sex.,"When you start dating someone new, there’s always the question of when you should have sex for the first time. Society says after three dates, your grandmother says after marriage, your penis says right now…but when’s the actual right time? Nobody on this sub seems to care , or seems to be headed in that direction. ",dating
752,"I (34F) did what most of the guys on this sub suggest and lowered my standards in the looks department to try to find a guy who is nicer, here is how that is working out...","\- I have zero sexual attraction to him whatsoever.

\-A sense of humor is really important to me and he has none. His dad jokes are so lame I spend most of our dates and texting conversations fake laughing at his really bad jokes.

\-We have very little in common and his hobbies and things are not something I would be interested in doing at all (Magic Cards, pokemon go).

\-I have spent money and precious little free time I have on dates with this person that I have zero chemistry with just because he is nice.

Attraction to me has so much more to do with personality and sense of humor than it does with looks and neither looks nor personality is there for me even though he is nice. This is why I am always baffled when the overwhelming suggestion to women on all the dating subs to ""compromise"" by finding a nice guy that may not be the most attractive to us. It turns out, if I were to pursue a long term relationship with the nice guy that I am not attracted to, we would likely have a really lame sex life and we would have nothing to talk about or do together because we don't have the same hobbies. So I did what y'all suggested and it's not working out very well. So to have a nice guy we have to settle for someone we are not attracted to and have nothing in common with?? 

TLDR: See lots of advice on the dating subs if you want a nice guy you have to lower your appearance standards. Wondering about the logic of having a good relationship with a person who is nice but that you're not attracted to at all.",dating

755,Ladies. What are you looking for?,"Be honest. It's a very confusing time for dating, and it seems many girls don't really want a serious relationship anymore, but just a man (or various men) that will make them ""feel"" something.

756,A lot of you men on here just have no game or confidence.,"I hate to say this so bluntly, but too often do i see men, especially men near my age (M21), say that they will forever be alone, or they try everything and still get rejected. The answer is simple, yall are just bad at talking to women. Whether it be you want a relationship, or just sex, you still have to “pull” the woman. Like i said im M21, 6 ft, and id give myself maybe a 6? Just an average looking guy, and i used to have trouble with women in early highschool, but ever since then ive never had trouble with them. So im going to help you. First and foremost, make them laugh. That should be your #1 goal when talking to a woman. A funny man comes off as easy going, and likeable. First impressions are everything, and if you can make them laugh within the first couple minutes of meeting them, youre off to a good start. Second, stop being so scared, women are people too. The same way you would approach another dude, is the way you would approach a woman. Ik some people have anxiety, but unfortunately, it’s very easy to tell when someone is unconfident in themselves, so practice. Third, please do not be a creep when flirting. If you dont know how to flirt, complimenting them is a good way to start. And not “damn girl your ass looks fat”, mention their nails, hair, hell even their eyes. And lastly, and this is mostly for dating apps like tinder. For Women around my age, “hey” is not going to cut it. You are one of many, go learn some pickup lines, clever ones, funny ones, sweet ones. But like i said first impressions are everything. Side note: you are going to get rejected, it happens, but dont turn into an asshole because of it. Being disrespectful towards women is a sure fire way to make sure you dont get any. Now use these tips and go get you some. 

Tldr:if you struggle with women its because your approach is wrong. Make them laugh, be confident, learn some pickup lines, and for gods sake dont be a creep, or an asshole if you get rejected.",dating
757,Men’s advice. Men who are unsuccessful with women share one characteristic: they make excuses,"Men who struggle with women almost always have a mindset of self-victimization. They believe that their unattractive qualities are static, and that women are a monolithic group that have somehow deemed them unworthy. 

When I was unsuccessful, I had the same mindset as well. It wasn’t until I took ownership of my situation, and realized that there were things about myself that I needed to change, that things began improving. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s also freeing. You realize you have control over most aspects of your life. 

- “I’m ugly.” There is a difference between being physically attractive and naturally good looking. Being physically attractive involves being in shape, wearing clothes that fit, having good posture and body language, being well groomed. Being physically attractive, which you have control over, is more important than being naturally good looking.

- “I’m short.” There are some women who put emphasis on height, and there’s nothing you can do about that. Move on. You see short guys with beautiful women all the time. The height requirement is usually a fabrication of the online dating world. A gregarious personality and confidence is far more powerful than height. 

- “I’m shy.” This isn’t a static quality. Being introverted and shy aren’t one in the same. It’s extremely uncomfortable, but you have to ask yourself if you really want to change. Being shy is the single biggest inhibitor to social success. If you can’t function socially, you should pursue therapy, or even medication if a mental health professional feels it’s necessary.

- “I’m boring.” This is on you. You likely aren’t boring, you are just afraid to be vulnerable and show people who you are. This is normal; it’s difficult to share ourselves with others, and face rejection.  If you don’t feel like you have a dynamic personality, or have much to talk about, you need to expand your horizons. Find a hobby you’re passionate about, read more, go out and try things you’ve been hesitant to pursue.

Bottom line is, you have to put yourself out there. You have to experience getting rejected, and having success as well. Until you’re willing to experience these type of emotions, things won’t change. No more excuses.

Edit: This post isn’t meant to be callous towards men who are struggling, or excuse bad behavior from certain women. It’s meant to point of that most things in life aren’t static, and that you have control.",dating

760,Girl I’m seeing is using Instagram stories as a tool to try make me jealous,"So I’ve been seeing a girl for maybe 2 months so far. She keeps dropping hints or making jokes that she wants commitment. She hasn’t flat out asked me yet. She has a great personality and is attractive. However as she is not a native, I know very little about her past. 

I have got the vibe off her that she may be quite promiscuous and personally that’s not a quality I would desire in someone I would take seriously. 

She has been using Instagram stories as a manipulation tool, posting different guys. I was flat out ignoring it for a bit but taking note. However, some guy literally flew in from abroad to stay with her the past few days and they are obviously fucking. 

Fair enough, we’re not in a relationship and she can do whatever she wants but the fact that she blatantly posts him at her house at 3am in order to get at me pissed me off. 

I won’t lie, it did sting seeing that. I have left her on read since Friday after she mentioned him again.

I don’t know if that is the right approach but should I just cut contact now before it gets any worse? Or should I hit her back up in a few days and just stop seeing her as frequently? I can’t see her dropping her multiple guy “friends” for me and wouldn’t want her to.",dating
761,I screwed it up last night,"I M32, really love my roomie F29, bisexual, she's beautiful in so many ways that I'm just in love with her, we are like a couple that does everything together without sex and cuddling. I've told her I like her, we've kissed several times but she's recently broken up a 10 years relationship with her girlfriend and is not ready for a new one.

 Last night, we went dancing and almost literally everyone around us wanted to make up with her, plus, she brought a 'friend' who has the same intentions. For me, it was a NIGHTMARE to be there. I'm not particularly jealous of girls approaching her because I know she is more attracted to women than men and me, as a man, love to see 2 girls kissing. There was a moment where this girl is kissing her and the man who is with that girl is trying to join them, at that moment I couldn't help pushing my roomie's arm and interrupt the threesome kiss, just like your partner would in the same situation. She was obviously surprised and told me ""what are you doing? I'm lesbian"" which for me, it meant, ""don't try to keep me from kissing girls because I prefer them over a man and you're not my boyfriend either"" or that's how I felt it. I explained her that I lost my mind when I saw the man trying to kiss them, she agreed, she didn't want to kiss him either and was thankful I didn't let that happen. 

She is totally fine. I am devastated. I feel like I still can't control the high anxiety jealousy gives me, and last night I showed the person I'm loving the most the major red flag I have.  Jealousy was a huge problem in my 20's.

I had this dream today after the incident where her friends came over and I went insane and made our home a disaster, throwing things like a maniac, screaming at and insulting everyone who was trying to touch her. I feel really bad.

I haven't been in a relationship for 3 years now, I've never really found love, I'm a thin 5'6 man so 90% of women would not be interested in me. I don't want to be alone anymore, I'm a failure, everybody says good things about me but no one would really go on a date with me. I work at home and I'm an immigrant so I barely have a couple of friends. The routine, lack of love, and life purpose not very often make me romanticize death as a peaceful place to stay. 

I want to have someone to love me, care for me, to grow economically and personally together, travel, explore, I'm tired of being alone and feeling lonely. My roomie is a perfect match but at this point, I don't know what's gonna happen. I really love her and want her with me 😭 I promise I will take care of her and treat her like she deserves.

763,Why does it seem like the majority of men fear committing to women?,"I've read so many posts here and on other subs where a woman thinks a relationship is great but the guy doesn't want to be serious or exclusive but is perfectly fine to have sex with her. Yet at the same time I've seen countless posts here about men being lonely and unloved and can't get laid etc.

It makes no sense how they can claim they want all these things they'd get from a relationship yet don't don't want a relationship. Meanwhile most women in relationships know they do a disproportionate amount of mental labor and general effort. So like, men don't have to do hardly anything while in a relationship with a woman who will likely take care of everything for them, and yet they're still adverse to commitment? Why? It costs them next to nothing and gives them basically everything. It seems like most men aren't getting one night stands by the boat load so it isn't missed sexual opportunities. What is it?",dating
764,Why has ghosting become so common and acceptable?,"This used to not even really be a thing. Not enough of one to have a term for it like ghosting. The past several years it's happened to me several times out of nowhere (always fairly early on within a month or so, not when in a long relationship), when things seem to be going very well. Sometimes right after they say something to the effect of they're looking forward to next time. After a few times it can really fuck with your head. Hard to give something a chance when even if things seem to be going VERY well with no bad signs of anything, there's a good chance that at any moment you'll never hear from the person again and have no idea why. One one hand I want to say I'm done with dating. On the other hand I know I can't just be celibate, lol.

Ghosting is something I've never done. The last couple times I've had to let someone down they actually thanked me for actually being honest and telling them. I guess they're used to being ghosted too.",dating

Why can't men get the same memo?,"Questions says it all but society always tells women to stop trying if a guy stops reaching out or responding. If he ghosts you let it go yet why do a lot of men not get the hint when a woman stops responding? 

It just makes them try harder and looks desperate or creepy. Yet why do men keep doing it? There's a fine line between pursuing and coming off like a psychopath. I have to verbally tell them to stop or I'm not interested anymore and even then it's a 50/50. They'll either get mad, get the hint and finally give up or theyll say well hit me up if you change your mind.

767,Women bringing up boyfriend when initially meeting,"Why do women bring up the fact they have a partner when we first start talking?

Before you start typing, I know the obvious answer would be that they aren't attracted and they don't want you hitting on them or something.

Here is the thing: I don't talk to them with the intent of dating or getting to know them as a future partner.

For example:

Recently I went to get a haircut. The barber was a woman that was around my age (20's). We start off the conversation normally and somehow she was talking about how her husband is lactose intolerant. So within the first minute of sitting down, I knew she wasn't single. The conversation goes on well for the next 10 minutes and she's asking me all these questions about school, work, and company. I tell her I'm going to be moving for an internship and so on the conversation goes...

Then, of course, I didn't want to make things quiet and awkward so I start asking questions about her. Like where she's from, and how things are going. One of my questions was ""How long ago did you get married""? And she goes how did you know that? I say didn't you just tell me a whole story about how he's lactose intolerant? She thinks hard and was like yeah...

This isn't the first time this happened with women when I talk to them. I just don't get it and not to sound pretentious & egotistical, but I would consider myself decently well-put. Are they trying to get a reaction out of me? Makes no sense

Would love to hear your input.",dating
768,The game of dating is changing,"I’ve been looking around in lectures and I see more women than men. The people with the highest grades are also women and I’ve started to see more female doctors than male. 

Then I look at the current dating culture and men are still expected to provide. Pay for dates etc… and I feel like very soon there will be a shift in paradigma. Because this isn’t sustainable anymore, soon there will be women with the big jobs paying most of the bills. The men will start taking a second seat and we can’t really see them as providers anymore because we are the main source of income. I saw an article that in 2030, 45 of women will be single and I just don’t find that realistic. 

People still fall in love and want to create a life with someone. But I do believe there will be a big change in how we approach dating. And I think it’s good, I am glad that women have more of an equal opportunity and maybe with the change it will lesser the burden of men in dating situations.

774,"How do people who ""date casually"" while looking for a better partner live with themselves?","I genuinely don't understand this fake-casual dynamic lol. How can someone be so evil as to rationalize keeping someone in a relationship / situationship while also being unsure of what they want and actively looking for someone to replace their partner? 

It's spoken about so casually. I don't get it. As an adult aren't you supposed to realize that you're inflicting horrible trauma on your partner that will take years or even decades to resolve? Aren't you supposed to stop for a second and say ""hm, well maybe I should stop traumatizing them and wasting their time""? Especially when one of them is more in love with the other one. I genuinely do not understand how childish this behaviour is, and yet it's basically the norm in our society. 

Don't get me started on the ""oh we're just using each other"" trope. Nope. I will never understand how people will go out of their way to minimize entire months or years of time spent with another person. 

I think people use it as a flex, to an extent. For instance, they have such a good support system you can fall back on to whisk them away at a moments notice, so they blindly allow themselves to step on other people and form situationships while narcissistically focusing on their personal melodramas. Most people don't have the luxury of being able to go on a bunch of vacations or 'busy themselves' with their incredible lives after experiencing something so devastating. So why are we letting these types of people walk all over everyone else.

775,Some women are more shallow than men,"A lot of guys might have some standards, but no matter what type of woman you are there's still a lot that will find you attractive. Women use height as one of the most important traits for a deal breaker. It doesn't matter if you just want a taller guy, the fact that you do means you still care about it. Most guys don't care all that much about height and it's not always a deal breaker. I'm 5'4 and get told I'm too short on a constant basis. I increase my height to 6'0 on apps and get matches left and right. The women that are shorter than me don't give me a fucking chance at my regular height. As soon as I increase my height to a tall guys height, it's like bees swarming to a hive of honey. Not only that, but a lot of women are more likely to be attracted to a more muscular guy. Skinny guys are often a no go. Skinny or fat guys are literally told to go to the gym to increase attractiveness, like wtf? Women can be as thin as a pencil and it's perfectly attractive

. God forbid men are Skinny. Men can't even be insecure either. It's like if men were to have a little tiny bit of insecurity then he's not worthy of being with anyone and every woman on the planet will automatically be repulsed.

I had accepted that I was likely to die a virgin considering my career path, and I was okay with that. when the relationship ended I was left reeling for over a year, my career stalled out, then COVID hit. I was trying to move on before the pandemic, hanging out with friends at parties, going to bars with friends, using dating apps with advice from my sister and friends, to no avail. I realized I was happier when I  wasn't looking for relationships, when I wasn't trying to fulfill the need to just lay next to someone, to feel their warmth and be able to share parts of me with someone. so before you pull out all the stops on a girl that's likely to discard you, consider where you will be at the end.

784,Study: Women find emotionally open and sensitive men feminine and therefore sexually unattractive,"collaborative study led by Prof. Gurit Birnbaum, head of the experimental psychology program at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Herzliya, indicates that women don’t find “responsiveness” in a man to be sexually appealing.

Published in July in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, the research project involved three studies, one observational and two experimental.


In the first study, 56 pairs of men and women — single, heterosexual Israeli university students — discussed a problem in one of their lives. In the second and third studies, participants sent online chats about a life problem to someone they thought was a person of the opposite sex; in reality, they received an automated reply that was either responsive or unresponsive to their woes.

When participants rated their conversation partners for responsiveness, sexual attractiveness and how typical they seemed for their gender, on average the males labeled responsive women as more feminine and therefore more sexually attractive as a potential partner.

Yet the female participants were, on average, slightly less attracted to men who seemed more responsive, viewing such responsiveness as a feminine quality. They were more attracted to men they found masculine, meaning not necessarily very responsive.

“Responsiveness may signal to a potential partner that one is concerned with her or his welfare, and may therefore increase sexual interest in this person,” according to the report’s summary. “Research shows, however, that this proposition holds true for men, but not for women.”

Birnbaum and fellow researchers Tsachi Ein-Dor of IDC, Harry T. Reis of the University of Rochester (where Birnbaum did her post-doc after earning her PhD in psychology at Bar-Ilan University in 1998) and Noam Segal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign theorize that there may be a brain mechanism that could explain why men and women in their small sample displayed differing sexual reactions to a responsive opposite-sex stranger.

“Studies 1 and 2 showed that men, but not women, perceived a responsive stranger as more gender typical (masculine/feminine) and, in turn, as more attractive. Study 3 revealed that responsiveness increased men’s perception of [a] partner’s femininity. This, in turn, was associated with higher sexual arousal, which was, in turn, linked to greater partner attractiveness and greater desire for a long-term relationship,” they write.

“These findings suggest that whether responsiveness affects perceptions of partner attractiveness varies in individuals, depending on the contextually based meaning of responsiveness.”

They theorize that many women may rate responsiveness as a less important factor in determining a man’s masculinity and attractiveness.

“Men can be sexually appealing in various ways, which are not necessarily associated with expressions of intimacy, whereas women apparently have to be responsive to be appealing,” said Birnbaum.

But because not every woman in the study downplayed responsiveness as a typically male behavior, the researchers caution against drawing any wide-ranging conclusions.

What a joke. If you are a man, BE STOIC AND COLD WITH WOMEN. Its the only way to be sexually attractive! DON'T OPENLY SHOW YOUR EMOTIONS TO WOMEN! It ALWAYS KILLS sexual attraction!!",dating
785,"I spent a lot of time on this in another thread, so I thought I'd post it here too. Advice from a former ""player"" on how to spot one.","I am a ""reformed"" total POS who used to use women like kleenex (don't ask). I cheated on EVERY SINGLE ONE of them except the first, and I never gave a crap about 95% of them or even remember their names to this day (yeah, yeah, cliche, I know).

Why am I ""reformed"" you ask? Did I see the error of my ways organically? Am I a ""nice guy?"" Heck no. I gained a bunch of weight, had a daughter, and got a divorce. Those three things made me realize (1) I couldn't get women as easily as I used to, (2) I started thinking about dating them from the ""that's somebody's daughter, and how would I want my daughter treated"" perspective (ughhh), and (3) being divorced with a kid is a deal-breaker for virtually all of the hottest/most eligible women my age.

I now have a girlfriend I am 100% dedicated to.

Therefore, I believe I am in a unique position to illuminate the differences between a douche and a ""real man.""

1.) Does he seem too good to be true (not in your head but objectively)? He may be a douche. The best example of this is always saying the ""right thing"" at the ""right time.""

2.) Does he either say little things that make you think he may be controlling or show you a lot of interest sometimes but very little others (inconsistent)? He may be a douche.

3.) Is he secretive/very private about things and says things like, ""I don't want you talking about me to your friends?"" He may be a douche.

4.) Is he often busy without good reasoning and doesn't seem to make much of an effort? He may be a douche. Some may argue this just means he doesn't like you, but let's be honest, 99% of the time there's only one reason he keeps you around when he really isn't that into you.

5.) Does he avoid meeting friends and family or having you meet his friends and family? He may be a douche.

6.) Does he always want to be alone with you and rarely wants to go on actual dates? He may be a douche.

7.) Do his actions not match up with his words (words are cheap)? He may be a douche.

8.) Does he have primarily female friends/followers on his social media? He may be a douche.

9.) Do the things he says not add up (lots of contradictions, back-tracking, etc.)? He may be a douche.

10.) This is the most difficult one. Be honest with yourself. Try to be as objective as possible. Would you date you if you were him? If the answer is no, he may be a douche. Douchebags often go for the low-hanging fruit.

A lot of those men out there are good people, who want to do the right thing. They are simply so confused by how women think and what they want sexually that they’d rather stay safe and not play ball than risk their embarrassment in this new environment. 

It’s not that they are necessarily afraid of women, it’s that they are afraid of how their own inexperience with women in general could potentially fuck up their advances.

788,Why do fat girls keep liking me?,"This has been happening to me as far back as high school. Every time I make friends with an overweight/obese girl, I find out later that they like me. I'm okay with girls that are a little curvy, but not so obese that they don't take care of themselves. I never like those girls, I don't make an effort to get that close to them, I just treat them like I do any of my friends, I laugh with them and treat them with respect and politely listen to them when they need to talk. I hate it when this happens because the feeling is never mutual and they end up getting their feelings hurt, which makes me look like the bad guy. I'm turning 26 this July and I've only had one girlfriend in my life back in high school, and even that didn't last very long. It just sucks that I have such bad luck at attracting the wrong women, and not just fat obese girls, but even normal looking girls that turn out to be annoying or badshit crazy. Why does this happen?

789,Taking to a new guy I’m not all that attracted to physically,"So I (24f)recently started talking to this guy (28)who found me on Instagram through a dating app. Before we met in person I saw his pictures and we talked on the phone a few times. His face isn’t ugly or anything like that and he had a nice voice so I was down to meet up. In person he’s a bit on the shorter side -I’d be taller than him in my lowest heels- and he’s not my typical type body wise he’s chubby and normally the guys I’ve been with have all been pretty anal about their workout regimen and things like that. 

We’ve hung out a few times and he’s really nice, unintentionally funny and considerate [this is the beginning so idk if he’s going to stay that way] but there was no immediate attraction so the other day I went over to his apartment with the intention of letting him know I saw him more as a friend than a partner. Somehow he got his mouth around my nipple and we ended up having sex with a condom and It was really good like the best sex I’ve ever had with a condom. 

I hate condoms because I’ve never had a good time with them on so I normally just wait until I’m in a committed relationship and we both know we’re clean and feel comfortable going raw 

Now I’m conflicted because we hung out tonight and had sex again and again 👨🏽‍🍳👍🏽🤪. If his personality stays the same I could see something long term but I’m not attracted to him until AFTER we start the foreplay and all of his foreplay isn’t all that 
•he was laying on my chest so his hand had easy access to my crotch area and he did this weird thing where he rubbed the hard part of his palm on the outside of my vagina kinda hard it started to burn a lil and that’s when I was like “this guys a virgin were for sure just gunna be friends”. This was literally right before the nipple sucking so I hadn’t said anything about only being friends yet• 
The thing is I like to be dominant at times, like I’ll lay back and take it no problem but when it’s my turn you better be ready,plus I know guys don’t always want to initiate the sex but I don’t see myself starting anything. When I was riding him the faces he made were kinda ugly and I know sex faces aren’t cute but…. 

I don’t want to ask him to change because he’s comfortable as he is or so he seems but I think I’d be more attracted to him if he were to gain some muscle. Also this is only the beginning of the relationship so it doesn’t feel right to even think about talking to him about it because what right do I have??? So what do I do?? 


Also side note our last round of having sex we were doing it from behind and he took the condom off and said he came (in the condom) but I didn’t feel it -he cums very animatedly so I’d’ve noticed- then he went to the bathroom and came back and layed down then asked me to give him head which I find odd because we just went 2 rounds and you literally just came so why???? I think he might have stealthed me if I hadn’t been paying attention but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t wanna be paranoid, I had an ex do it so I made sure to be on the look out since I admittedly dont know him very well. I’d appreciate thoughts on this too.


Edit: I’d like to clarify he’s not ugly, I don’t mind being seen with him, I’m not embarrassed or anything like that and while someone a bit taller would be preferred his height isn’t a dealbreaker. It’s just he’s soft as me and I’m not used to that. Ive always said if I can’t see my partner picking me up or defending me I wasn’t interested and I don’t see that rn

Edit #2: Thank you to those who actually tried to see things from my side instead of just judging. I wanted to address some things 1.I listed things I liked about him those if you saying I don’t like him please feel free to reread. 2. I didn’t mention his diet because I don’t know his eating habits yet and don’t want to jump to conclusions. He works in the medical field so I’d assume that he eats healthily. But if I were to judge by the past it’s probably not that great. 3. I find it concerning that so many of you glossed over the side note. Maybe I shouldn’t be looking for advice here.",dating
790,He did nothing special for my birthday :/,"So recently it was my birthday! 🎉 I turned 24 so nothing too special but the guy (he’s 25) I’ve been dating for about a year didn’t really do much except snap me happy birthday after midnight. I wasn’t really expecting anything but I kinda got my hopes up after his girl BFF’s bday last month. He showed me what he got her and was excited about it. I thought wow, I wonder what he would get me for my bday at the time. So I guess I’m comparing myself to his bff here but I’ve known him longer than her and they got closer faster but I can’t lie, I feel pretty hurt by it. He’s always talking about how he’s a romantic and if I was his gf I would see how, but he did the bare minimum and it honestly made him less attractive in my eyes. I feel kinda dumb for feeling this way but at the same time I’m thinking, I want a guy who will jumó through hoops for me, I know he’s out there. I mean my own boss who I only speak to a few times on business days even wanted to bring me cake and balloons TO MY HOUSE and I had to stop him 😂 honestly I don’t know how to bring this up, guys help me pls 😭

EDIT: I know I screwed up by not saying yes but I’m a very shy girl which has stopped me a lot from dating before. Ive never been a “girlfriend” which is why i just kind of dodged him.

791,I (29F) went on 5 dates with a guy (32M) who approached me,"So venting because I need to after my most recent experience. I went on a 5th date this past weekend with a guy who approached me in my apartment complex about grabbing a drink. We have seen each other around for awhile and chatted every so often so it wasn't totally out of the blue for him to ask. We had a great time on all of the dates, even discussing some previous relationships and our views on things on the last date. I go back to his place and again are talking about relationships and I say well, my intention is to seriously date at this point in my life and he responds, seemingly rehearsed, that he is not and having just got out of a relationship he just wants to have fun. I think that's great for him to do if he isn't ready for a relationship, however then you should not be approaching people (especially those who you live near and will run into often) and go on multiple dates.... Obviously I wish I would have brought this up much sooner.  I'm not sad about him necessarily, I think I am just pissed that this person wasted my time and/or assumed I would be ok with ""just having fun."" Maybe rhetorical questions but why do I have to be upfront about my serious intentions but it's ok for people to not be up front about their lack of serious intentions?

I had 3 relationships and 5 other flings (all younger than me) through my lifetime, but I always ended up frustrated by their dominating manner. 

It annoys me that my men were trying to take charge in our relationship and dictate my life. As if they were challenging my freedom and independence, I detest this. I know what I want. I already have all plans and projections of my own future. Respect my decision. Even on small things like date night, I want them to understand that **I** decide where and what to do. When I ask for a date, just get ready and I will pick you up on time. Don't plan ahead. *I lead*. Just join me. 

It irritates me even more that some men thought I wanted an alpha man to challenge me. Why would I want that in a relationship? I want a submissive and receptive man I can protect, mommy around, keep him safe, help and guide him on the right track. 

I don't know how I can attract the right type of people and achieve this dynamic. I consider myself quiet decent, even charming. An independent young woman with a STEM degree from a top university, I even work two jobs while still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I have a great physique, not as buff as professional weightlifters, but *buff*. Still, whenever I find a potential submisive partner and try to make the first move, most aren't interested. Some even ghosted me.

Edit: Thanks for the advices. I think I do need to communicate further about what I want in a relationship before starting one. And to clarify the faq: 1) I'm drawn to my exes because they appear (and are sexually) submissive, I didn't know they're actually quite dominant in a relationship. 2) No, I am not attracted to masculine-but-gentle men. Sissy/effeminate boys fit my taste though. And no, I don't think of submissiveness as a form of whimp or immaturity. Women in traditional/conventional relationships (especially one with DDLG vibes) act this way all the time and no one accuse the women as whimpy or immature, I think submissive men should be treated with the same respect.",dating

She can go on dates, cuddle, kiss, and hook up with people, but she just can’t feel anything. I’ve had really bad luck with dating, and never really any contact with women, so when she cuddled me every time we were together, I was over the moon, and was under the impression that she felt the same way. This isn’t the first time this has happened, either. The last girl I tried to date a year and a half ago (F19) said the exact same thing to me. Guys, if any of you do this, you’re a pathetic excuse for a person, and you’re ruining it for guys like me who try so hard year after year and get nowhere.",dating

Online dating is the worst, I really think I'm at my breaking point with it.","Maybe this is premature but I can already see where this is going. Within a few days of me making an account, I managed to match with 3 spam bots, and 3 single moms who gave ghosted me and deleted me lol.

I kinda have been on/off with online dating I usually just use it for 3 months at time and then get off. Its only Day 4 and I already want to delete this godforsaken app. Now they make you verify yourself with for this stupid blue checkmark like its Twitter lol smh so stupid.

It's always been depressing for me because it makes me feel worthless. I'm only 27, I am medically retired from the military so I retain a bunch of benefits for me (and my future spouse), got a very nice pension and graduating college. I'm planning on going to graduate school so I have alot of things going for me. I'm at least above average and I'm really tall, and I am in good shape. Im extroverted so I'm very social. 

 I'm not a girl and I understand that online dating caters to females but man its such a joke now. Its impossible to match with a girl who is not obese or a single mom. Really hard to find someone who is in my league, I would have better luck just going to the local bar and hitting on anything that moves at this point 😂 The struggle is real.

803,"I saw a ""Dating as a woman is NOT easier"" post posted here a year and it is bullshit.","Women get to pick and choose among an endless amount of men while men get whatever they can.

For the average women and above-average women men are like pebbles, You can find as many as you want, play with them, and then throw them away. For the average and slightly above average man, women are like gems. You may not like the color, but sure as hell, you won't throw it away easily. In the post she mentioned she is lonely, I get them. I'm not going to dispute it.  But most men are not only lonely but also craving for touch and sex and the feeling of being desired.  I don't hate nor dislike women. Despite what I sound I don't harbor any negative views towards women as a whole as certain groups do. I'm just pointing out the truth. And yes I'm short and with a small dick.

805,"If >95% of women reject a man based on his height and race, what's the correct interpretation? Does it mean the man is garbage? Or does it mean most women are garbage?","If you designed a new food that >95% of people spat out the second they tasted it, even if <5% could tolerate it and say ""yeah I guess it's okay,"" you'd probably conclude you had a pretty terrible recipe.

Similarly, if your race and height make most women reject you before they are even willing to talk to you, then the obvious conclusion would be you're a pretty terrible recipe yourself.

Alternatively, you could say if the majority of an entire gender only cares about your height and race, then the majority of that gender are terrible. Many people consider that ""misogyny,"" although I've been told that interpretation by many women (including my own mom). Eg. ""If a woman only cares how tall/white you are, she's not worth knowing.""

Which do you think is the more favorable explanation?

One leads to seeing yourself as garbage (accepting the physical criteria of women as valid) and the other leads to seeing most women as garbage (for judging human value based solely on height and race).

I personally don't see either as ideal. I suppose both are probably true.",dating

Women if you go to a bar or club (places where it is common place for people to go to in order to hook up or find a new bf/gf) and you get all dolled up,  then it's stupid for you to get mad when guys hit on you as long as they do it in a respectful way.

I find it hilarious when I go to a club/bar and I see a woman that has her hair done, make up done, nails done, and is clearly wearing clothing that will make her look as attractive as possible, and then I approach her respectfully and she is taken by surprise that I am approaching her. This is about as stupid as it gets. 

This is literally like the equivalent of me going to job fair, wearing a suit and tie, and carrying a briefcase full of resumes with me....then when I get approached by potential employers, I'm like, ""Why are you approaching me with job offers?...That's weird.""

Do humans not value other humans anymore? Look, sometimes you just want to be fwb, or dip out on a girl because you're not feeling it- but there is a way to go about things!! Do we not have common decency this day in age. If I had a dollar for every guy that dies to date me and as soon as we have sex, he dips out....I would have at least $20. Which is fine, if that's what you want then that's what you want- but don't lie, don't be deceitful, and at the very least have the common decency to tell a girl ""hey I just wanted sex, sorry but don't want to talk anymore."" I mean for the love of god what is our culture. Is it so hard to send a text to someone saying you don't want to talk anymore? Especially someone you have literally been inside of! Grow a pair and send a text. We really have to revert to ghosting, it is so pathetic. 

And I am not talking about the guys that are obvious douchers. I am talking about the manipulative, sociopaths who lie for months just to get laid. The guys that take girls out, tell her everything she wants to hear, lies straight to her face, just to get in her pants and then disappear. And somehow women get blamed for it. ""Oh you slept with him too soon,"" ""oh you should never trust anything he says,"" ""you really think guys want a relationship,"" yada yada. Here's my thing, I would like to be able to trust what men say. I don't want to be jaded for the rest of my life. I would like to be able to have sex without worrying if he's gonna dip out after- but they make it impossible!! I am so jaded by the countless men who have lied straight to my face just to get one thing. And I am a laid back girl. If you want to be fwb, I am in. If you want to date, share feelings, be in a relationship, then I will consider it. But be honest. Don't act like a knight in shining armor and then shape shift into a piece of scum overnight. 

And another thing!! So many dudes act like it is a numbers game for them. They will have sex with a girl, it will be great, and yet they have a compulsion to move on to the next. Ummmm is there something wrong with having sex with the same girl more than once? Are you afraid that one day you will magically wake up in a relationship with her? Yeah that's not how it works. If the sex was good, why do you have to go sleep with 100 other women? Our vaginas are all the same bro...what are you looking for, the world's tightest vagina??? You trying to have sex with a virg?

That was a metaphor btw not looking for any people picking that a part because it has nothing to do with OLD *eyeroll*

812,Men might be less inclined to make the first move nowadays,"Because in any environment where there is some sort of administration it’s simply not worth it.

Because at any time, if an advance by a guy is rejected, that girl could approach the administration and get him in trouble.

For example, if its on college campus: Guy approaches girl, asks for her number or asks her out or whatever his methods may be. If she does not like it, she can go to the school administration, file a sexual harrassment claim saying the advance was unwanted, and that she may not feel safe with him around, and that guy just got kicked out of school.

If it’s at work: Same deal, guy tries to ask out a co-worker, she can go to HR, state the same thing, the advance was unwanted, she doesnt feel safe around him now, and he just got fired.

Any environment where there is some type of administration overhead has now become a place where a guy cannot make any first moves because if the girl were so inclined, she could escalate the encounter into one of not feeling safe and the guy just got kicked out\fired.

The environments where a guy can make the first move have been significantly reduced in recent years.

Imagine if you as a girl, approached a guy in college, asked for his number, he rejected you and if he was so inclined, informed the school your approach was unwanted, and now he feels unsafe around you. Now you just got kicked out of school, or faced disciplinary action, on record.

This is reality in America

813,Why i feel online dating isn't worth it for women who want a relationship,"I'm a 24F and have been online dating for a few years. Here are the reasons why i feel it usually doesn't work for women (or even men) who want a relationship. Now I'm not saying EVERYONE is like this online, but this is generally what i find to be wrong. 

1,) Large amounts of men on there just want sex or something ""casual"". Sometimes they'll lie to you and lead you on and say that ya maybe i will look for something more, i just go with the flow etc. But usually they're just trying to lead you on, they want instant gratification and lose interest in actually going on steady dates. 

2,) Most are losers in some way. NOT ALL, Most guys on there can't find a gf in real life, because theres something wrong with them (Again not ALL i'm just saying in general) Its very rare to find a guy you mesh well with that has his shit together, motivated in life, and a good person. I have been looking for years and still haven't found one, i don't want to be in my 40s and still dating online. 

3,) I feel like men online obviously get way more choices in women to match with and they kind of get addicted to it. For example, i dated a man i met online for a few months, he wanted me to be his gf and everything seemed to be going ok. Recently, i saw that same dating app on his phone, and decided to make a fake female account and sure enough, i started talking to him. As the fake account I asked him what he was looking for, he said he was looking for a girlfriend! (When we were obviously still dating and he didn't mention a break up to me). And that with the last girl it just didn't work out LOL. My point is, i feel like these guys get addicted to talking to other women on there, and they get into this mentality that theres always someone better. So even if you actually make it to a relationship with them, they might end up getting bored one day or missing flirting with other women, or just curious to see who else is new on there. So being that they already have this habit, they will probably at some point get back on there..

Did you ladies or men have similar experiences like this with online dating? I'm kind of getting sick of it and its a lot of time and energy",dating
814,Are sex robots going to solve the problem of single men?,"I have been getting a lot notifications from this sub where men are basically complaining about their sex lives and how hard it is for them to get a girlfriend or something like that.

Well, I already know that many of you are going to comment that sex robots will never replace real women. But hear me out: what if companies creat super realistic looking sex robots that look no different than a real woman and are also supported by super advanced AI. These robots will not only be able to provide sex, but they can also have conversations with you like a normal person. They can give professional therapy. You can program them to love you unconditionally or force you to become a better version of yourself. They will look like and even behave like super models and actresses. And they will also be very affordable. The possibilities are endless.

I personally believe that as a society, this is our only option to solve the problem of single men. I mean what else can we do? Nature has designed women to be extremely choosy so a lot of men will never be able to be attractive to women and find a mate. We cannot force women to have sex with men that they do not find attractive. If you have any other options that is better than affordable super realistic AI sex robots then I will absolutely listen to you.",dating

I keep to myself and can be pretty shy, unless you know me. 

When I was younger I had male friends, but a many of them ended up really liking me through our friendships.

Both on dates and at salsa dancing I’ve had women ask me if I’m working, and when I say no they look visibly disappointed and disinterested.

I feel unemployable at this point in my life, and since women seem to care so much about employment and income, it makes me feel like I just have to miss out on relationships.

I wasted my 20s doing a Bachelor of Arts, with Honours in Philosophy. The only reason I studied humanities was became I thought at the time I was too dumb for anything else. Now I’m in 3rd year law, and women seem more impressed, but it’s still really hard to even get a first date or a ONS.

820,Why is it so hard to find a woman who is of a healthy weight?,"I always wondered. It seems to be the holy grail for men in dating. Like I myself have gone out with ladies who covered themselves with makeup and nice clothes/shoes but none of them made a single effort toward their bodies. Like I'm not asking that she is a fitness model or something. Just of a healthy weight. I'm also not picky when it comes to genetic beauty standards like face. Like I don't expect my women to be a model that looks like Megan Fox. She is what I believe most men would consider the epitome of feminine beauty when it comes to face. Probably less than 1% of the women out there are on the same level as her.

But I mean just finding a woman who just has simple healthy habits like talking regular walks/eating healthy and therefore maintain a healthy weight seems like rare and almost impossible for me to find. The ones who do seem to have a LOT of options and are really in demand on the dating market out there. Like most men I see around me naturally seem to bring this to the table. This is what I bring to the table too(I have a fit body). Like I said somehow whenever a woman gives me a chance she doesn't have this. She's either really skinny and not into sports at all or on the heavy side. Either way they seem to have 0 interest in physical activity.

821,"So many men I(23f) meet or hear about seems to be attracted to teenage girls, and it makes me feel kind of unsafe and insecure in dating. Help?","So many posts on here talk about it, we hear about i constantly in the media and from celebrities, there are litterally a porn category called teens or just turned 18, it's everywhere!

Not only that, but my entire life I have been called ""cute"", ""adorable"", ""the quiet shy girl"" like I'm a helpless little girl. Basically it has felt like people where infantilizing me. Yes, I am a quiet person, and I have insecurities (I struggle with my mental health, so some of it might be very visible to others). But I am also smart, and I have a personality! Now at 23 (soon 24) I continue to meet people (all genders) that call me by these adjectives, and it doesn't stop there; since I'm kind of petite, and maybe because I don't wear make up, I have always looked younger than I am. It's only two years ago someone mistook me for a 15-16 year old! I have never met someone who where not shocked to hear my actual age.

It has made me so self conscious! To the point that I suspect every man who show interest in me, to be a pedo. (other than the teen boys, those I just feel embarrassed for, and really icky). And I start to wonder, if it really is just my looks, or if I don't seem mature enough for my age. It has kind of given me a complex with not wanting to ask for help ever, and huge perfectionism in being good at everything, so I don't seem too much like a child or too ""adorable and cute"".

I have come to understand that most men are mainly visually stimulated, (which is what makes me suspect them if they show interest in me) but would most, if they want to date, not also look for personality and stuff like that, to see if were compatible and on the same maturity level? Obviously there are superficial types out there, who only care about looks. But people who are looking for a relationship would care at least, if not more, about personality and compatibility right?

If this is the case, then what makes a person seem mature? Since my looks make me look so young, how can I make sure that when people get to know me, there will be no questioning that I'm a teen? As I said, I do struggle with mental health so I'm not the most confident and outgoing person (and pretty inexperienced too). But I live on my own, I have a job, and I take responsibility for my life. I also have clear values, and many interests/hobbies. What else would make me seem mature and adult, to compensate for my looks?

Last question: what would give away that the man who is interested in me, is only into me because I look like a teen? Because I seriously fear, that guys I'm with are only with me because I'm the legal solution to their pedo fantasy.

Edit: Okay, so it seems like I didn't word my question right.. So of course I don't blame anyone for seeing an attractive person when it can be hard to know their age, and it turns out it's a teenager (as long as they drop it after finding out their age). This was not what I wanted to discuss/ask. What I am saying is that people litterally approach me, flirt with me, even ask me out, and then get surprised when they find out that I'm older than I look (aka not a teen). Also,  I have had too many very unpleasant experiences with people who call me ""cute/adorable"" in quite an infantilizing manner, and in the same sentence talk about sexual scenarios with me. This gives me the impression that the men who approach me, do so because they think I'm much younger than I am, and this seriously creeps me out. I don't want to attract men like those. I don't want to accidentally end up in a relationship with someone who gets off on that I look like a teenager.

823,A Guide to OLD written by a woman to men,"I'm pretty new to OLD, but I see people (mainly men) complain about it, so I put together some observations/experiences I've had that might help.  (Edit: multiple posters have said this applies to women too so I wanted to add that. Also I added an 11th tip)


1. **Please actually enter something in your profile.**

If all I have to go on is your photo, then yes, I will judge you based on your physical appearance. I can’t see anything else. And bonus - please have more than one picture, especially if you're not going to fill out the profile. 

2.**In your profile, put something specific about you..**

Even if I don’t think someone is the most attractive, I’ll swipe right if they sound interesting. Attraction can develop if we have similar interests. Your bio gives you a shot to show a peek of who you are. Don’t waste it.

3. **Please no group shots. If you must use them, then max 3 people and make sure they’re at the end.**

It is a waste of time to look through and see which person is you, especially in the first picture. Just please max 1 group shot.

4. **Please no bathroom selfies, especially if you aren’t wearing a shirt.** 

It’s not as impressive as you think. I’d much rather see a pic with you at the gym or doing something physical than just abs and a toilet in the background.

5. **You’re better off not posting a picture with another woman (unless you’re looking for a third)**

Anytime I see a woman in a picture I wonder, is that his sister, his ex, a friend? Don’t open the door to these questions. Just post a picture of yourself. Also, not my cup of tea, but if you’re looking for a third, please post pics of both people. If you don’t, I always wonder if the girl even knows you’re doing this and it just makes me uncomfortable.

6. **If we match and you just say hey, I might not respond. If you say something that shows you read my blurb, it’s more likely to pique my interest.**

I filled out the blurb for a reason. I mentioned something about me. If all you do is say hey or comment on how pretty I am, it’s nice but I’m way more likely to respond to someone who took an interest in what I had to say.

7.**Show don’t tell**

If you’re a chef, post a pic of you cooking. If you’re an athlete, show a pic of you playing your sport. If you like to hike, show a picture of you on a hike. It adds credibility and makes for more interesting shots.

8.**Don’t ask weird/inappropriate questions that you wouldn’t ask in person.**

I’ve had men ask about my racial background moments after saying hello. That leads to an automatic ghosting. It makes me uncomfortable and I’m sure it’s not just me. I'm sure there are tons of other questions that people ask off the bat that are rude too (asking men their height is one that comes to mind). 

9.**Don’t lie about your age.**

Instant turn off. If you say ""I like more mature people"", then recognize its immature to lie about your age. Also, hiding your age doesn’t make me more likely to swipe right. It makes me wonder what you’re hiding.

10.**Accept you may not be for everyone.**

I know rejection (or perceived rejection) sucks but presumably you just aren't trying to match with any warm body. A good match is better than someone who annoys you every time they talk (or vice versa).

11.**Don't be afraid to alienate some people in your profile to attract the type of people you'd like to match with.**

I am big into a number of interests that are considered very nerdy. I put this up front in my profile because I know that guys who think that's cool will swipe right and the others will swipe left and that's exactly what l want. It's a waste of time to match with guys that would find it unattractive.",dating
824,"Beta males are becoming more and more common, and this is dangerous","Hey there, 22M here. I've had my fair share of relationships, I love women and I always try to improve myself if there are any problems, but I know that for many men it's not like this. Many men, other than having an almost non existent sexual power, are afraid of commitment, afraid of being honest with their partner, afraid of doing or saying almost anything for the fear of screwing up. Most importantly, many men purposefully neglect their woman, preferring to play online videogames or watch Netflix, because ""she will always be there for me"" as if she is some kind of object that remains where you put it. Some time ago I had a relationship with a woman that had a ""boyfriend"" who knew of me, and even though they lived together they didn't even touch eachother and slept in separate rooms, I know this because I went there several times and when I didn't go me and her would call eachother almost 24/7. He took care of his PC and of his videogames, but I took care of his woman, and trust me I know how lonely that girl felt. I've learned that women want strong, manly, reliable men that can be sweet and kind to them, not weak little boys that don't know what to do with their lives. Women need to feel safe, protected and valued like the complex human beings they are, not treated like objects to use. You don't need to be a 2 metres tall muscular giant with a perfect face, heck I am 165 cm without any shoes on, but it's about being kind, reliable and manly in the time of need. Even though society will tell you you're a fascist for saying so, the truth is that manliness is fundamental for maintaining healthy relationships. What is unhealthy is the excess and the misuse of it that can lead to violence or, as it's happening more and more often among men, the lack of it",dating
825,"At 31, I'm pretty worried that I've completely fucked myself over in the realm of dating. What do I have to do?","I'm 31, 6'4, with an athletic build, I have a variety of active hobbies and interests, always eager to try new things but... I'm really struggling to find a match that I personally consider attractive. And it's really starting to concern me that I've completely fucked up. All the chances I had in my 20s with women I was attracted to, the women that I dated and slept with... now seem like they were just flukes. And these apps have me convinced I've spent all my luck back then and there's no hope left. I'm really not trying to be a terrible person but I seriously only match with women so below my means that it's really making me question my own outward appearance. I used to think I was somewhat attractive, as that's what my 20s have told me but now it just feels like a cold lie I fed myself. I truthfully never match with a woman who is near my height, never match with a woman who is equally in shape as I am, and in the very, very ultra rare chance that I do... she'll have multiple kids. I really like to think that I'm better than my matches but after years of being through this, seems like another lie I've convinced myself of. And honestly, if I had matches here and there that were comparable to my interests and level of attractiveness, I wouldn't complain. It's the fact that that *never* happens.

So, what are my choices? I really don't want to die alone and at 31 the clock seems to be running down to the wire for me if I want to settle down. Am I really going to have to settle for someone I don't find attractive? I want to approach women out in the real world but again, the years and years I've been on these apps have crushed my soul and have made me feel so low about myself worth and my appearance that I don't think I'm good enough for anyone that I'd considered because they probably swiped left on me. It's a stupid thing to be scared about, but it has me utterly fucking afraid.

826,I (30F) am so annoyed with the guy (25M) I am casually dating right now. On my couch alone feeling unappreciated and undesired.,"So long story short we met after I had just come out of a relationship, he’s a great guy and usually I have nothing bad to say!

He is, however, totally emotionally unavailable for a real relationship. He states otherwise but, there’s some emotional growth that needs to happen there and regardless he stated he wants casual with me so here we are.

I’m ok with this because he’s engaging and fun! The sex is great, we have fun climbing and hiking together, we laugh a LOT, have great conversation, and he’s super affectionate. Even if it’s not forever, all of that feels great!

Except I am flabbergasted by how much of a jerk he was last night. As the username implies I’m a bit of a “granola” gal but I was like hey you know what, we haven’t seen each other in a week — I’ll get dressed up and make him a nice dinner when he gets here. 

So I threw on a dress, got a little extra fancy, and started in on making a really nice dinner for him.

When he got here, he was obviously visually interested and stoked on dinner, but he was stoned and on his phone THE ENTIRE DAMN TIME.

When we sat down to eat, not so much as thank you for cooking, you look nice, whatever. Just wanted to watch something over the rib-eye I had just made him.

At one point he slides his hand on my thigh, but that’s about it. He said he was just exhausted…which is fine, I totally get that that. But THE PHONE.

This is the same man who complains about women being unresponsive on the apps, not putting in effort, etc. His friends are actively trying to date me…all is to say, I don’t see this as a ME issue but it still sucks!

I’m currently on my couch just…annoyed. I can’t decide if I bring this up in the morning or try to be understanding about how tired he was. 

We cuddled until we fell asleep, I kissed him goodnight on the cheek, and he is currently asleep in my bed. 

I’m feeling just so…unappreciated and let down by his total lack of engagement that I couldn’t sleep.

Im usually pretty reasonable, my feelings as a friend/casual partner just are hurt as I feel super disrespected and undesired! Not exactly a winning combo when things are supposed to be fun :(.

Do I bother bringing this up in the morning or just move on? It sucks because I normally really enjoy his company, the most out of anyone I’m seeing, but crap do I feel unappreciated!",dating
827,I've approached dozens and dozens of women over the last 4 months and haven't gotten even a nibble.,"I just don't get it. I keep reading. Confidence, confidence confidencee. I don't think I am an ugly.man. I am a talented musician and an awesome dancer. Leople generally love me and think I am awesome. I get compliments all the time. The way I dress, the way I carry myself, my dancing, my music skills. I am bombarded with comoliments about all that shit.

But women arent attracted to me! No matter what I do. Best dressed guy in the venue. Well known with tons of social proof. I have a ton of friends and acquaintances. But fucking women are always ""meh"" about me and I have spent my entire adult life trying to figure it out.

The only thing I can come up.with is I am a really ugly.man. I have to be. No one goes out every weekend for several months on end, approaches women, is polite and non threatening. Yet still gets rejected over and over again..

I just want a woman I find attractive to smile at me, flirt with me, let me know the finds me attractive. Instead I get polite small talk and a soft rejection. I mean I put myself out there. I approach tables with 5 or 6 women. Very few men have the balls to do that. I figured that alone should get me some kind of brownie points with 1 or 2 girls somewhere. 

The only conclusion I can come too is I MUST be an ugly man. I hate to say that about myself but what other reason can there be? I carefully and studioisly eliminated every downside I have control over. 

I just don't know what to do because I.am tired of approaching girls and getting ""ho hum"" or ""meh"" reactions from girls.

For the last 3 months I have put myself out there time and time and time again. It's frustrating and it hurts because I am a really great catch. Wtf is it I am missing? I am well groomed, clean cut and have tons.of talents. I have an 8"" dick and know.how to use it. Wtf is it I am missing?",dating

831,my girlfriend(21) of 7 years cheated on me(23) after going abroad. All her friends called me crazy when I was right all along. Should I forgive her again and start over or move on.,"In 2021, my girlfriend got pregnant, and we had to do an abortion. It was due to financial reasons and the fact that her parents were reputable people in my country. Our next step was to apply for a student visa to move to Australia, but I was rejected, and I had to go to a Middle Eastern country to work my way up, and she went to Australia for studies, and we were hoping one day we could be together again. After 6 months away from me, she met a guy on Tinder, and they went on one date, smoking flowers (we both smoke, so it’s normal). He invited her to his place, and she did the deed, and she told me the next morning that he had forced himself on her. (This guy was from our same country.) And after that happened, I started talking to a girl and fell for her slowly. But me and my girl never stopped talking; some how, one day, she got to know about this and texted that new girl. They added me to a group call and said I was a bad guy for doing that to both of them. Then I asked my girl to come to the country where I live so we could be here and hopefully start a new life. And she came after a few weeks. She stayed with me for 4 months and got really sick. I took care of her like no other and gave her all the love and care I could muster. I feel like this is the time I fell in love with her again after she betrayed me; sadly, her parents again forced her to go back to Australia. So she had to leave. I only told her three times to stay with me. However, she had to listen to her parents, and I respected her decision and helped her go back to Australia. Then again, this time she went to another city to one of her friends' houses (a girl), and she's dating a local guy. During this time, she went clubbing with her friend and her boyfriend. The next day, she told me she had some drinks and had passed out. This was very odd for me. Everything was off again, and I know when I get this feeling that something is not right. I kept asking her if anything happened; she always said no, and then one day she accidentally sent me a screenshot of a guy's profile (that was meant to be sent to her best friend). I knew she would delete it, so I took a screenshot of it. Then I asked her who it was, and she told me that it was her friend's boyfriend. but still, it was off. So I texted that guy who was on the screenshot via Facebook, and she got pissed because of it. Then I had to know why she was acting like that and kept calling me crazy for doing that, so I called that guy. He told me that he's really the best friend of that other chick, and they met in the club and kissed each other while dancing, and after that they all walked back to her friend's place, where she was all over him, and while watching a movie, he fingered her. And he stayed the night, but they didn’t fuck. When I asked for it the first time, she denied it. Then I texted her friend and asked her to tell me the truth because it was her responsibility. She told me the truth, and my girl admitted it really happened after one whole week. And the reason for her doing that to me was because that guy made her feel happy at the club at first. When he kissed her, she kissed him back, so that means she was in for it and it was a conscious decision.

I feel lost and weak.

1. What is your attachment style?
2. What is your conflict style?
3. How many relationships have you had and how long? How did they end?
4. What are your emotional baggages and triggers?
5. Childhood traumas?
6. Financial stability. What are your goals in life?

833,Can We Normalize Explaining why We're not Interested in the Other Person?,"This might be unpopular, but I think it would be very helpful at least to me as I take criticism and build myself upon it as long as it is healthy and constructive.

&#x200B;

I completely understand you're just not into them. But please don't ghost people. It drives the other person insane trying to figure out what they're doing wrong, and I know it seems rude or tough to do, but if you just tell them why you lost interest instead of just going dark and hoping they disappear, you might actually really help them find the next person and not carry the same problem over, unless of course it's something they can't change about themselves.

&#x200B;

If the problem is with their weight, height, age, personality, sexuality, religion, skin color, etc., it's still better that they know why you're not interested. Instead of you making them go through mental hell trying to figure out what they're doing wrong, tell them you're just not interested in dating people of different skin color or only date people who are above a certain height.

&#x200B;

And yes, this is coming from someone who is currently left in the dark, trying to figure out what went wrong. I didn't love-bomb, I believe I am an attractive person, and I am just heartbroken as the person I have had several very pleasant conversations and experiences with just dropped off the face of the earth.

839,The problem with online dating isn't men or women; it's pretty people,"People keep saying that men have it worse or that women have it worse.

I think the less attractive people have it worse, and the top 10% of both genders are trickle-down jerks -- not because they are inherently mean people necessarily, but because they have a ton of options and it's just human nature.

If you're in the top 10% of attractive women...I can say from experience in dating a couple of them as a man that these women generally do not have the ""men just wanna have sex and then they leave you alone"" problems the 90% of women I hear from often put up with. Multiple guys want LTRs with them. So they friendzone and use them because they can.

And these top 10% that all us guys anxiously swipe right on...don't wanna date us 90% generally due to being buried in so many much better options. And when they do they often leave us on read.

Same with top 10% of attractive men. They don't have the, ""women don't swipe right on me"" problem. The Tinder Swindler had 3-5 dates a day who funded his lavish lifestyle. They use women and move on, like the top 10% of women, because they can.

And us 90% of both men and women...are all getting by each other due to the trickle-down effects of the 10%.

I see this on dates. We meet in person and they're more attractive than their profile (like, maybe top 15% of attractive women), and don't seem quite as excited about me. They gripe about online dating and how they keep getting rejected by the the top 10% or whatever. Meanwhile, after the date they reject me, who is probably in the top 30% -- and by extension I can't even be mad, because I rejected someone else to make room for this more attractive person.

We're all being treated rudely by people more attractive than us, which creates a culture in which we are more likely to be rude (or consistently rejecting) to people just as or less attractive than us, and the only people not feeling the pain are those at the top of this abusive hierarchy.

It's just the way the game works. And ""settling"" doesn't work either -- if you don't really like the person you pair with, that makes for a hard LTR.

If there were fewer options it would be easier to get to know each other beyond the surface and develop something. But this swipe culture makes us get treated shallowly and makes us shallow...except for the most attractive people, who have their pick and can be abusive in their dating, ruining the reputation of the rest of their gender and making us all ruder, lonelier, and more disillusioned...even as we also contribute to the problem.

I dunno how to fix it. But that seems to be the big problem, clear as day. It's not men or women who are the jerks. It's the way that online dating empowers the top 10% of each gender to be trickle-down jerks.

Edit: Yes, of course there is more than attractiveness in choosing a partner ...especially if you are very attractive and overwhelmed with options. If you are less attractive and have limited options, you either get really lucky, settle, or be OK alone -- man or woman. Kinda like...of course there is more to having a nice life than money. But if you have money, you have more options and can be a bit pickier.",dating
840,Why would a lot of men would rather sleep around than date?,"This post is going to be a little controversial. A lot of people are going to get upset but I think it might be very helpful for some women if they want a better understanding of men.

I know a lot of women complain about how when using OLD a lot of men will open with something vulgar or something sexual will come up in the first few messages. They also complain about how men just want sex, and a lot of us (not most) just want sex. Here’s why:

A lot of them are sending out those messages just to get a girl that is also into those things. They know that it won’t work on a woman that wants a relationship because they don’t want to date. Because dating and trying to date is becoming increasingly not worth it for men. Let’s just think about this with an open mind for a second.

As said by one of the dating gurus I follow (she is a woman before anyone tried to call me a misogynist), “To date as a woman, all you need is a smartphone and some patience. Dating as a man is like trying to win the lottery with a ticket you found on the ground.” This honestly is a very accurate statement. 

It’s significantly harder to get a date as a man than it is as a woman. There’s also significantly more that men have to do. Most men already have lower chances of getting a date, we also have to invest more money into a date, we don’t have many options whereas it’s easy for any woman to see multiple guys at once, we’re competing against pretty much every other guy in a 100 mile radius when a woman we’re seeing has no competition, and to top it off, a lot of this doesn’t change when you get into a relationship except you then have less time for your friends and self because you are trying to keep another person happy so she doesn’t leave you.

A lot of men just see it as being not worth the trouble. It’s too much financial, physical, and emotion strain and it’s easier to shoot a risky text to a girl we match with in the hopes that she might wanna hookup and never talk again.

Now I didn’t make this post to say that women have no struggles when dating, they do, but I don’t think they compare to men’s struggles.",dating
841,"Why I think dating is much harder as an average male, than an average female.","22 year old virgin guy here. There's a lot of posts of women saying that they have it harder. Men say no it is us who have it harder. Well the fact of the matter is we all have our own difficulties. Women may be bombarded with attention, but let's be honest, it tends to be very superficial. Men need to understand that someone wanting to have sex with you and move on to the next isn't very attractive nor is it what most women seek.

However, it is infinitely easier for women to get dates, based purely on the fact that men are expected to approach. It is far, far more likely for a shy woman to receive a date invitation than a shy man. On dating apps, women generally (and I mean generally) expect the man to send the first message, and expect the man to come up with a date venue and a date date. This means that a lot of pressure and responsibility is thrusted upon men.

Furthermore, if we look to the r/seduction sub reddit, it's apparent that a lot of men treat women with little respect. There was a post of how when a guy decided to insult women instead of compliment them, his success with women skyrocketed. Many young men read this kinda stuff and think, well shit if I don't do this and instead am a gentleman, women will avoid me. The men who respect women and try to avoid creeping them out are called nice guys and weak.

Now I'm not saying that being nice and cordial should instantly land you a date. It isn't even a basic requirement to have dates, as we can see that many men who employ tactics such as negging have much success. Being nice doesn't entitle you to date. But my point is that many men who are nice, and can't get dates, feel like they have to be like these men who haven't an ounce of respect for women in order to be liked by them. Essentially, being overly respectful and avoiding being a creep is far less successful than not giving a single fuck and to saying to a woman whatever you think, even if it is creepy. 

It feels like, for men, we have to act a certain way and behave a certain way in order to be noticed as sexual beings.

In conclusion, the main point is that women have it much easier to get dates, this can't be denied. Statistically then, they have a much higher chance of meeting someone they connect with than a man does.",dating

843,Causal sex problem. Help! Am I a bad person?,"Casual sex partner asked if I slept with someone else because I have vaginal tears.

Hey all,

I’ve been doing the causal sex thing.

I was going pretty steady with one guy on Tinder. We met in October and been having casual sex for about two months now. We didn’t set boundaries on being with only one person. Half the time he doesn’t reply back to me so I don’t even know what he is doing and plus he lives and hour and a half from me. 

Then he didn’t respond for my texts and would leave me on read so I thought he lost interest and decided to sleep with another guy on Tinder.

We are by no means in a relationship, it’s just casual sex.

I had casual sex with guy number two and let’s just say it wasn’t great sex and the guy was kind of a jerk. 

So I was like well I guess I’ll be celibate and lay low.

The Tinder guy number one who didn’t respond to me for about a week hit my up again.

Tinder guy number one wants to see me again but I told him i have micro tears in my vagina, which is true I do because Tinder guy number 2 didn’t use enough lube.

Tinder guy number one asked me if I had micro tears from sleeping with other peeps and I said no.

I lied and I feel so bad for Tinder guy number one.

Any advice? If I go back and tell him I did sleep with someone else, he is not going to be happy.

Also, is that breaking the casual sex rule? 

We are not together and plus tinder guy number 2 is done. I’m never speaking to him again. 

I had safe sex with the both of these guys so is it really Tinder Guy number ones business? Not trying to be rude.

845,Is there really a market for a man like me?,"So, I had this awesome chat with a really cool lady on Reddit. She was a crazy gamer chick with issues. Just my type.

We hit it off so well that we decided to exchange numbers and continue our conversation on Whatsapp. We talked for hours, having a great time, but she couldn't help but ask for a picture of me. I was hoping my personality would win her over before introducing the visual aspect. Surprisingly, she was actually totally impressed by me and even wanted to meet up, but she was still insistent about wanting to see pictures.

I tried to convince her to leave what I look like as a final surprise. A cherry on top of the proverbial cake. After much insistence from her though I sent her a picture of myself cleverly masked in a way that drew a comparison to The Phantom of the Opera (little did she know that this held a hidden significance).

She shrugged off my attempts to keep the mystery alive but grew increasingly annoyed with me. I caved into the pressure so I quickly took a selfie and sent it to her. I had already won her over with my irresistible charm, so I convinced myself that my looks were of little consequence.

I saw two blue ticks.

But no response.

I messaged ""?""

There was only silence so deep that I could hear a swirling tumbleweed in the desert of my mind.

I waited, but it then occurred to me that she had blocked me.

I quickly went into the reddit app (🤬) and sent her a message asking her why she blocked me. She told me ""play to your market"". I asked her what she meant by this, she said ""you know 🧟‍♂️ "" and quickly blocked me.

How could I have been so foolish to think my looks would be of little consequence. Now I must tell you dear reader. There was a reason I was not quick with the picture. I, dear reader, suffer from the disease of ugliness. It is so bad that even my loved ones affectionately call me swamp monster.

Her statement got me thinking...

""Play to your market""

Play to my market?

It has left me wondering.

My defining quality is that I am an ugly, grotesque looking creature. Is there a market for such a man? 

Are some women into ugly men? Maybe there is some sort of fetish? Where may I find such women? 

I ask these questions in good faith.

TL;DR: Met my potential soul mate. She quickly ghosted me after seeing my picture. Told me to ""find my market"" (whatever that means?). Now I'm left wondering if there is a market for me (as an unattractive man).

I've also pursued slender women before, but I have to put in far more effort if I want to hook up with them, and I just don't see the point, when I'm already attracted to fatter women and it's so much easier.

852,I’m emotionally cheating in my 5 year relationship,"25 year old female here, who’s been in a relationship going on 5 years now. Boyfriend and I have lived together 3 years out of the 5. A big reason we live together is financial reasons and we hoped to one day start a family. 

I’m hitting a point in our relationship where I’m very bored, barely motivated, or wanting to spend time with my partner. (My last Reddit post explains a lot why) Over the years I’ve always been the one to address doing anything- park dates, dinner dates, concerts, traveling etc. Things COUPLES DO?? I’ve introduced all the experiences we’ve had together, but not vise versa. My bf is 28 and before me, he really hasn’t experienced life. I blame that on his family and how they were raised because his family really never experienced anything growing up. They didn’t travel, do activities, don’t even spend time with extended family, his mother and siblings barely have friends. Just very closed off people who i have very little in common with. I know I can’t “change” that about his childhood, but I’m starting to see those traits now, and I can’t relate to it at all. 
Bf just wants to work his 9-5 job, come home everyday and blaze up. I’ve always smoked, but not nearly as much as I do now with how often he’s lights up at home. I can’t help but smoke along because that’s our “bonding” at home after we both get off from work. The amount of money he’s spent on weed has blown me, I know it’s too much for what he can afford. 

I miss going to the gym, having couple friends, dancing, making funny videos with someone, coming home and hearing “babe get dressed let’s go try this new restaurant in town.” I get none of this. Never really have from him. I’ve tried talking to him about it, but he gets mad & shuts down saying sorry he’s not good enough, and he doesn’t have the “funds” for all that right now. Total guilt trip Yet I feel I’m barely asking for anything! The most frustrating thing is I’ve given him the blueprint of my expectations and what I want in our relationship, they’re never met. & if I speak on how they’re not met it turns into days of arguing and it flipping onto me. It’s just not worth it.

Recently, I’ve been talking to men online, through text, on the phone. Just to distract myself from everything. I used to be such an outgoing person, and now I’m introverted with barely anyone to talk too. I feel like I have to keep my partner separate from all the things I want to do in life because it’s just not matching up. I haven’t gone out and physically cheated, and I don’t think I ever could. I know it’s wrong, but it’s literally keeping me sane having someone uplifting and exciting to talk too. Do I enjoy doing this? No. I wish my own bf could fill these voids. 
Not sure if this is something I need to address to bf before I cut things off, if I do decide to do so. 

Anyone been in a similar situation?",dating
853,"Women of Reddit, if you were promiscuous in your early 20s and broke the cycle why do you think that was and when?","Had a conversation with a close female friend this weekend and it got me thinking.

She was “horny” and promiscuous from 22 to her mid 24s and would sleep with one, two or three guys each month and then eventually would date a guy every month or two and immediately bounce to another if not seeing two at once. 

She said when she was mid-24 or so she stopped being so horny and needing of physical attention and sex was still fun but not as needed and calmed down with the boys. 

That got me curious if there’s a biological correlation to when a young woman is most “baby ready” and if there are hormones that trigger a young 20s into promiscuity because their body wants to procreate and thus they are more accessible to men.

Just curious what stories or angles others can share. Thanks.",dating
854,I Feel Like Society Only Accepts Women Sexually Until She Doesn't Put Out,"For refrence, 30F and a virgin by choice. Considered secular according to my community (so, not considered religious). Spiritual. I'd love to save sex for marriage for a multitude of reasons - spiritually, emotionally & physically. I value sex and hold sex as the highest physical intimacy. It's sacred imo and I do not take it lightly. I value my celibacy. I am NOT asexual. I am NOT aromantic. I am so attracted to men physically & emotionally - I find men very, very highly attractive. I would say I am personally not a prude nor timid about sex and love to flirt and show my sexuality towards men. 

This is honestly just me ranting but I am disheartened by society and how it treats women who don't put out sexually. Basically, I feel like society is all like ""you go girl! Sleep with who ever you want, whenever you want! With how many men you want!"" UNTILL a woman is restrictive about her sex life and decides (like me) to ONLY want sex after marriage. Which again I have reasons for. And I am not ashamed about them. They range from very, very practical reasons like Birth Control (for example - I use abstinence as my ""prefered"" BC method) to emotional reasons (I don't want a man to use me sexually and discard me) ect.

Here's my issue - I am so disheartened by feeling so out of place in society because of this, in the sense of for example how I get treated & labeled. Meaning? I am seen as weird. And WHY?? Think about it for a sec! Let's be honest here - All because I literally ""don't let a man IN me""...That's crazy to me! I feel in my soul super conservative about how I'd like to save sex for marriage. I cannot help it tbh. It's in my very nature, I feel like. I don't want to apologize for how I feel. I hate that women like me get treated less than and are very easily compared to objects when men say such disrespectful things like ""why would I buy the car without trying it out first!"" As if we WOMEN are CARS to be TRIED OUT. Disgusting. 

And just to add to this - Initially, I have no problem dating someone who's for example, religious. Someone who is hopefully going to be more respectful about my values because they'd probably be closer to his. The problem is, I'm considered too ""secular"" according to religious communities (in my religion). And, I'm too ""conservative"" (because I don't put out sexually, physically) for secular men. So, I feel like I belong no where in the dating scene, here at least. And, I have no problem dating outside of my religion but here it's pretty rare to find what I think I'd need from such a potential partner (I think it would be much easier in the US). 

All in all, I feel like I don't belong. It's disheartening because I'm NOT weird. I'm literally like any other women libido wise. I have sexual fantasies, desires ect. Many of which aren't even vanilla to begin with lol. I am just more conservative about actually having sex face to face because I think sex has consequinces and I am not willing to freely put myself in that situation with any man other than my Husband. I am sad that that is such a radical thing to feel in society these days. I don't feel like it should be. I only want to give myself physically-sexually to my Husband. It feels like the right choice for me. I think every single women should do what's best for her! As long as she's not hurting others (and others is also including herself). 

I feel like very well meaning ppl have told me in the past that the right man for me is going to respect my values & bounderies and wait for me....and as much as that sounds so incredibly beautiful & romantic (!!) - at this point, I don't know if I'm just being naive or what. Because I can see that even religious ppl (not all but seems like most?? Or at least way more than I thought!) in my community have sex anyways prior to marriage so it's like...even ppl I THOUGHT might respect me and what I need, already don't want a woman such as myself with my sexual bounderies ect. Which don't get me wrong!! They have every right to have those prefrences. I respect it. It's just so disheartening because I was naive about it because I thought they'd want to save sex for marriage as well (meaning they'd let me do so if they were dating me, not that I expect them all to be virgins per se especially at my age). 

I also did a lot of soul searching. Like a good thought experiment. I thought okay, let's say you found the perfect man that respects you and he's religious (from our community & religion)...would that be okay? At first I thought YES. But then I realized, life isn't just about him respecting my decision to have sex only after marriage. Life is about life after marriage. And so, I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to lead such a religious life with said religious Husband. Because we'd differ too much on the religious scale and I would be dishonest and betray myself. So again, this has led me to feel alone in my feelings on this WHOLE initial topic. 

Idk what to do. I don't want to compromise sexually. I don't want to betray myself, my heart, my soul and my bounderies in order to conform to society, sexually. I don't understand why is it so radical to hold such a position in this day and age (saving sex for marriage). Why can't woman like I feel this way? Why can't we choose this for ourselves without being belittled and made to feel less than. 

Thank you for letting me rant 🙏

When he said that I couldn't believe it, I paused and told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore and that he was very rude, and then I left. He kept calling my name and apologizing as I walked away, but I ignored him. When I got home, I saw his messages apologizing, and I told him I'm no longer interested and don't want to pursue this, so I blocked him, and he tried to contact me again.

858,The no “click”,"I (31/F) dated a guy for 3 dates (35/M) and I thought he was a total catch. He shared a passion for the outdoors with me, we would spend hours talking about books, and had intense sexual chemistry (at least on my side, but pretty sure he felt too because he dropped the words “sexy” multiple times). I wanted to have sex with him, but wanted to go slow because I was 4-6 months out of a toxic relationship that started too fast and I was so afraid of that happening again. So on the third date when we’re making out on my couch and he’s asking what I’m comfortable with, I tell him I want things to progress slowly. Honestly, I wanted to fuck the shit out of him I was just feeling really insecure and coming out of a really stressful time (I started the semester going back to school which was a huge adjustment as a 31 year old), so I played it extra cautious. He  then asked me what I was doing for the week/end and he was going out of town so we both knew it would be at least a week until we’d see each other next. He told me he would catch up with me when he was back. I texted him once a funny/flirty text to which he responded and laughed and said he’ll catch up when he’s back. But then the weekend comes and goes and I never hear from him, so I felt like he lost interest in me. I was upset, and I texted him on Monday I felt disappointed our communication dropped off and that it felt a bit like a waiting game for him to reach out (especially when we’re texting at least once a day before this). I was super nice about it, and told him I really liked him and appreciated those dates, but that I want to spend my time wisely and I should move on. 
He responds that he’s sorry if his lack of communication bothered me, but that he was feeling reserved and didn’t feel that “click” moment he normally looks for, and said we could be friends doing outdoor things, etc. I told him I’d keep him in mind because I didn’t want to burn the bridge.  

At first, I was upset because that sounded like his interest dropped off because we didn’t have sex. There was definitely chemistry/click there in a sense of emotional and intellectual compatibility —I just think I left him sexually frustrated because of my own insecurities. I was very flirty and loved showcasing my seductive side with him so I purposefully built up the sexual tension. 
Now, a few days have passed, and I CANNOT stop thinking about him. Normally when I shut the door on someone, I shut the door and don’t look back. But with him, it’s different. I’m so full of sexual tension I have no idea what to do with myself, I’m going crazy. I realized I was being too guarded with a guy who seemed genuine and kind (and of course he wants sex, he’s a guy), and may have teased him without trying to be that way, I was just insecure.
I just can’t help thinking that the “click” was the sex that never happened, because I’d be lying to myself if I said didn’t want it too. 
I want to give this another chance, and thinking about reaching out to him and asking if he wants to come over for a bottle of wine and let the cards fall.

Once you do find a match though, you can hit them up and maybe if you're lucky you'll get a response and exchange snaps or something. But you see, here is the catch. Women in the dating scene have multiple men in their contacts at all times because that's all you are to them, an option. You have to be astronomically lucky to find a woman that is actively talking to less than 5 guys at any given time. This doesn't even take into account their ""sneaky links"" or ""situation ships"" that is dicking her down every night while Shes texting you.

Now my perspective on this is that it shows a lack of trust on the women’s part, since to me it is no different from looking at attractive women at the beach or the shops or whatever. I also agree with something my happily married grandmother used to say, “If you’re not looking, you’re dead.”

I am someone who follows a lot of Insta-models and 99.99% of them I know I’ll never meet, and short of dropping a like or the rare comment, will never interact with. I’m not trying to ‘slide in the dms’ of any of these ladies, and even less so in the rare event I have a partner.

867,"If you have a girlfriend and she tells you she's not an affectionate person, she is not the one.","This goes out to a lot of men out there who stay in toxic relationships. If your girlfriend tells you she isn't an affectionate person, such as wanting to hold your hand a lot, cuddle with you, or tell you how much she loves you, or rarely shows it at all, she does not truly love you. 

&#x200B;

I have met many women who say that all the time with boyfriends they dated. They tell them they're not very affectionate, and their boyfriend is very needy. Years later, they meet someone new and they instantly click. All of a sudden her views on not being an ""affectionate person"" is all wiped out clean. All of a  sudden she is overly affectionate and desires that man. 

&#x200B;

I have also dated women who weren't affectionate with their previous boyfriends, yet one girl met me, and she said ""I have never felt this way about a man before. I usually am not like this or affectionate at all, but I just can't help myself when I am with you."" And she goes out of her way to see me, or does many things for me, even when you don't want it. But the girl is still crazy over you.

&#x200B;

She just does not feel that way about YOU. And that is fine. Maybe you guys really don't click, and you don't give her that feeling in her heart. It's probably best to not continue the relationship. She eventually will dump you regardless, or she will settle for you, but in her eyes you will never be her number 1 man. You will never be valued at all by her. She will never put you on a pedastal or even her equal, but beneath her. You will be treated to countless arguments, even when you just want the best for your relationship.

870,Dehumanizing people based on their height needs to stop,"""Hey, you're face is too messed up for me to date you""

""Hey, you're nose is way too big""

""You're eyes are just too far apart. That's not my preference.""

Although you have preferences about someone's face, nose, and eyes, you probably wouldn't say those things to a potential dating prospect. Culturally, we have mostly outgrown saying those things because we recognize that behavior to be very dehumanizing. Not to mention the fact that those qualities cannot be changed without surgery.

But its not just the verbalization of those above quotes that we have outgrown. It's the acknowledgement that we shouldn't reduce people's value to the way their face is arranged, their nose length, or the distance between their eyes. 

So, why is it still socially acceptable to reduce a man to his height by calling him tooo short (implying that none of his other qualities matter)? Or, in rarer cases, calling a woman tooo tall?

You might as well just tell them that their bone structure and genetics is not good enough for you.

And by the way, I'm not demanding that women be attracted to sho..rt men, nor that they pretend to be attracted to them. Same goes for men regarding women (usually because they are tooo tall). Physical attraction is typically non-negotatiable.

 All I'm saying is that, in the same way we have outgrown reducing people to many of the qualities that they can't change, we should strive to do the same in regards to height. 

Anyone who has ever had a relationship will tell you - Attraction is built over the time of getting to know someone. Even people you were intiially unattracted to/unsure about. And sometimes, those can be the best relationships you've ever had.",dating
871,What’s wrong with a guy asking a girl on a date?,"Sorry, this question is just sparked from a couple of videos I’ve seen lately. I’ve just seen women being incredibly rude to men who, at least in these circumstances, seem to just be interested is setting up a date.

For one example, I just recently saw one instance where this woman was working out and this man politely waited until she was done with her current exercise to ask for her number. And without missing a beat she just said, “oh no, I’m sorry, I’m too young for you.”

Or another where this woman was screaming at this man for even approaching her while waiting for seats at a restaurant.

What’s worse is following all these videos is something passive aggressively written like “can’t believe he would even ask me, made sure he won’t again 🙂”

I understand when women go out, not everyone is looking for a date or a romance. And I’m sure if you are asked enough, it can get annoying. Or depending on bad experiences it can even trigger bad memories or panic. But, at least in these videos, that doesn’t seem to be the case. But everyone in the comments of these are like “yeah u go girl”

I guess I feel like it’s best to politely turn down someone’s advances, and if they don’t get the message then you can get nasty. But by automatically being terrible, you may create a terrible experience for that person asking you out. And that may lead them to be someone another person would have to get nasty with in the future.

875,THIS is why FASHION will help you get girls," Fashion is one of the things that i think can improve your dating by 1,000 if you're not optimizing it.

The reason why I say that is because I am someone who didn’t optimize fashion at all growing up. I grew up with a single mom who worked 3 jobs and I had no time to even think about that kind of stuff.

As the years have gone by my friends and girls I’ve dated have slowly helped improve my fashion, and one little thing can make a huge difference.

You get a better first reaction which boosts your confidence which makes for a better interaction.

And guys I have no passion for fashion, I’m literally the kind of guy who would dress in mis-matching clothes, multiple different brands and so on, but when your starting out and approaching, having that good first impression will make a world of difference.

Personally I have around 5 to 10 outfits that I cycle through, I don’t have a huge wardrobe I just wear the same stuff Bc I know it works.

One tip that has helped me is organizing my clothes into out fits.

This way, when I go to my closet I don’t have to think, hmm do these match, I just have a minimalist approach, have 5-10 outfits and rotate them

And a lot of my clothes are just all black.

It’s not something I have to think about and it’s easy to throw on.

You’d be surprised how much a girl will respond to you when your just wearing an all black fit, no logos or nothing. 

What’s more important is the vibe, your mood, how present are you, how congruent are you, what’s your emotional state like and what mood she’s in than what your wearing, but if your walking up dressed poorly, or your shirt is all wrinkled your losing an opportunity to have a good first reaction.

So looking up some simple fashion videos will make a world of difference. That’s something that I’ve been doing recently and It’s definitely a confidence boost when you go out.

Alright so linked below I left one of my favorite guys for fashion but honestly there’s a million people you can pick from.

878,Being a really tall guy and getting rude comments,"I'm a 7'1 guy, I know i'm really tall, and I have on a daily basis a lot of women usually even 2 feet or more (5'2 and under) women interacting with me and calling me an asshole for preferring tall women.  A lot of them tell me they want me to indulge and cater to these odd sexual desires and fantasies they have which I feel super uncomfortable with. They say i'm an asshole for not being comfortable with their height and rejecting them because apparently all tall guys love short women according to them so i'm an asshole because i'm not like other tall guys. One of the girls was 5'0 and said I was the perfect height for her but I told her i'm not comfortable with her height politely and was honest,. She then started getting super pissed off and yelling at me saying tall guys are supposed to like short women.  I told her shes doing the same thing by going for tall guys. I told her that I'm generally just more comfortable with women on the tall side so she gave me the middle finger and left. Like did I even do anything wrong? Why do women act like im doing something wrong and I feel like i'm forced to like short women as a tall guy because ""all tall guys love short women.""",dating
879,I thought it was bad because I was drunk. Turns out you can’t fuck.,"Dear you,

In this moment I want to rewind time and undo my sad, dirty mistake. I know… I know… there are no mistakes, “only happy accidents”. Or is it that they are “only life lessons”? Truth is, that was a mistake. He needs special help. Not the kind I am not obliged to give. He is responsible for his own actions as I am for mine. Yet when I came to the conclusion that I would not cum, I repressed my thoughts and pushed on. I would’ve been better off staying in a clean bed, alone and resting. But instead I left to give the worst head. 

And this is why I understand I need to be in therapy—learning how to reject these poor habits. I say poor but they are actually rich—rich with hard years of development. Asking myself why is all I can do. Why would I let you take my time and deny me a restful night? Self-sabotage, that’s why. Self-harm, that’s why. Choosing to believe I’m not worthy of more… my greatest defeat, I cannot lie. 

No, i will not see you again. Not in a sweet capacity. You need help and I am not your therapy. I hope you find your peace and may it give you dignity. We both deserve to be free of the chains we made. You may say you love me but you cannot even see me. My love, God speed.",dating

881,Starting to think I’m not pretty enough for dating apps,"I (25F) used to think that dating apps were the easiest way of meeting someone, but boy was I wrong. I’ve now been using them for almost two years and have had no luck whatsoever. I’m out here competing against girls who look like literal models and influencers, and even the absolute best pics of me (which don’t even represent how I really look) and well thought out prompts, aren’t enough. Even when I do get matches, I’m terrified to ever meet up with them because I know they almost definitely won’t be attracted to me in real life. The one time I did go on a date from Bumble, that’s exactly what happened and it crushed my self-esteem even more. Several guys have also messaged me insulting my appearance.

But the truth is, I don’t even blame these guys. Why would they bother going out with average or below average looking girls, when they have access to a plethora of girls who are absolutely stunning? Moreover, I’m also a brown woman, and it’s no secret that most men (of all races) have a preference for white or East Asian women, which in turn makes things even more difficult for me.

Any other women feel the same way? And do you have any other ideas of ways to meet guys besides apps? I had zero luck at school, university and work. On nights out I rarely get hit on and whenever I do it’s solely by guys who are so desperate for sex that they’ll hit on anyone.",dating
882,"""Don't Do It""","I'm a 46 yr old man. Didn't think I'd end up here, but here I am. I personally think that women are the most wonderful things on the planet: soft, sweet and a little bit evil. What more could a man want?

Went on a date with a girl last Sat. justa lunch date, a get-to-know you type thing. I thought it went well. But I have fucked this up before and showed all my cards within about 15 minutes. Well, things have changed a little bit. I know now that isn't the way to play the game. So after the date I labeled her name as ""Don't Do It"" in my phone. That way whenever I felt a little insecure and wanted that validation that makes me so high on life. I would remember. Now is not the time to show your cards.

For real, it SUCKED, I wanted to remind her that I am around. But whenever I thought of texting her I saw the message. ""Don't Do It"" It worked, it made me realize that she isn't the only one out there. I went to work, earned my money and didn''t succumb to that pathetic text asking ""How did your day go?"" 

Though she didn't reach out for a few days, I stood my ground. I am what I am, take it or leave it. Truth is I have other options, just like she does. So I am playing RDR2 on a Thursday night and guess who got a text from one of the most beautiful brunettes in the area? 

My friends. My brothers. You are worth more, just like everyone says. You gotta believe in yourself. It doesn't really matter if she texts you or not. It is more about who you think you are. So my advice is, that when you feel you aren't nothing but a bucket of shit just give yourself a little extra credit. You are what you are and as long as you're ok with that; the rest is just getting others to follow suit. Now, get out there, find someone you like and believe in yourself. Best of luck! Wish me luck! I hope you enjoy the holidays!",dating
883,I don’t think I can date White men..,"I (24F) am African-American and I live in a predominantly white state, I’ve grown up in predominantly white areas my whole life. I have great friends that are white - male and female - but I’ve realized I could not maintain a dating relationship with someone who is white. There are too many cultural and social differences that, in the long run, are too much work to explain. Does anyone else feel this way? 

Taking into account my experiences I’ve had as black woman and a first 
-generation, bilingual American there are many situations that only people who are not white could understand. I relate more with people who are Latino or even Asian, there are situations and feelings that I don’t have to explain because other ethnicities have dealt with it as well. 

I don’t hate white people at all, most of my friends are white and there are plenty of white men I have seen or know that I think are very attractive. I’ve just realized there are too many cultural and social differences between me and the white men i have interacted with. They are very sympathetic to my situations and feelings but they will never truly understand. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else has felt this way when it comes to dating?

Due to my experiences up until now, I figure I’m destined to end up like them at their age.

Now I find an actual study confirming my fear. I still don’t understand why it’d suddenly be more likely to happen at 45 though. Even if so (still depressing if it takes that long) there are 50+ year old virgins claiming it still never happened for them.

I don’t want to accept that I’ll just be a virgin who’s never had a girlfriend, even for the rest of my 20s!

I don’t know how I can get a career or soothe my psychological health that soon either.

I’d say I’m more “Forever Alone” than “in_cel” as I’m not a toxic misogynist, but I’m not sure that really makes my “long-term fate” much less likely to happen.

My goal might as well be “earn $100,000+ a year before turning 30”. (Not saying super wealth is necessary to attract women, just pointing out how unlikely it is to meet such a goal in 4 years or less).

I really don’t want to pay to lose it, it might just “confirm” that I was really unable to genuinely attract anyone in my 20s.

I have a headache. I’ve been trying to post something explaining better but no subreddit will allow it for some reason. I was full of emotion when I wrote it and even got into sexual abuse trauma from my alcoholic father. Maybe that was triggering enough to warrant removal????

887,I got angry and unfollowed/blocked him in haste. I miss him. Is it a bad idea to text him?,"We’ve been talking for about 10 months. We met off an app in December, never met in person as he flew to the US shortly after we matched and we’ve been talking consistently and doing long distance for the last 10 months. I really liked him. He had moments when he could be really rude to me which was bad.. but he had nice moments too. He was good company, I liked waking up to his voice and falling asleep to a long conversation with him. 
I’m not sure what happened this time. He called me on a Thursday.. I missed his call and called him back in the morning, but he didn’t pick up. I called him again over the weekend, no response. Silence. I called him again during the week.. silence. So I texted him and said - why are you ignoring me? And he replied to this saying - what is your problem? I was out doing stuff. I said ok and left it. I called once more.. no response. I sent him a nasty text after this and said “if you don’t want to talk anymore, just say it- ignoring is so immature. Bye” and I unfollowed him from my socials. He replied saying yeah yeah bye, and now we’ve both blocked each other.

889,Do you think there should be a section for penis size on apps?,"I think that size is a subject of extreme anxiety for guys, especially before having sex for the first time. However, I think that anxiety comes from the fact that there's really no knowing how a person will react, and that frankly, most guys don't fault that reaction which leads to not even perusing anyone out of fear.

Like many other things, I feel like it would ease that anxiety if men on dating apps knew that from very start, women talking to them are fine with it. Like other sections, there would also be the ability to simply put ""rather not say"" or ""ask me"" etc, which is very common.

Do you think this would make things better or worse, and what's your reasoning?",dating
890,Why are so many people comfortable with cheating on their partners,"
To put it out there I know everyone cheats. Men and women both, everyone is capable of it. My rant is aimed more towards men because of a particular story that I had heard from my ex. 

My ex boyfriend used to be married, he told me a lot about his ex and the things that went down with them. He told me that he cheated on her at one point in their relationship. So me being the naturally curious person that I am I wanted to know how it happened, the chain of events that led him to cheat on her and he told me

He said he met this girl as the store that he was working at, he said she was incredibly beautiful and had taken to him. So after seeing her a couple times they eventually exchanged numbers. After talking for a little bit they agreed to meet up and after a few times hanging out they eventually had sex a couple times. They way he described it, how fluent all of this happened it honestly blew my mind. He was obviously attracted to her, he knew what he could possibly get from her and he got it. He went out of his way for this girl, did things that I can’t even wrap my head around like going to a bar and staying up for 24 hours to be around her. 

What’s even more baffling was that his friends were cheering him on. They encouraged him to have sec with this girl. He even told me that one of his friends at the time was constantly cheating on his wife and was cheating on his wife around the same time he meet this girl. But all his friends were telling him he should do it. His ex wasn’t the best person but I don’t think anyone should get cheated on. 

It’s just the principle of it all, it was too easy, it’s like for some guys this isn’t their own subculture. It’s honestly gross and I can never look at him the same after that. His reasoning for cheating was because him and his wife at the time were living in separate states and she wasn’t giving anything to him. I somewhat understand your needs not being met by your partner but I don’t understand cheating, I can’t grasp surrounding yourself with people who are okay with your actions and even partake themselves. 

I was disgusted, still am, hearing this. The excitement in his voice, he was proud of what he had done. He told the story in great detail, even thought it had been a couple years since this happened. I’ve lost all hope in long term relationship and marriage. I’ve lost all faith, knowing something like this could happen in the shadows and you wouldn’t even know it. This story haunts me, I’ve lost all faith in relationships.

891,Girlfriend draws up 17-page contract for Tinder flame after dating two weeks. Isn't this legalized prostitution?,"New York post article:

""Within the 17-page document, Wright outlined all of her expectations for their relationship, which asked Head for no silent treatment, TO PAY FOR DATE NIGHTS and to not isolate her from her loved ones.""

Wouldn't this be prostitution or a form of it at least? If he is always paying for dates and they are having sex, isn't he just paying her for sex and companionship by buying her dinner and gifts? She NEVER pays. It's right there in the contract. I mean, he's a sap for signing it but isn't this just legalized prostitution?

I thought dating was supposed to be about 2 people getting to know each other that have MUTUAL interest. This seems like she is just looking for a free ride and wanted to make it legal so once he realizes it, he can't get out of it.

If this isn't legalized prostitution, what is it because it sure seems one sided to me and the guy is taking all the risk. Why can't she pay her half or pay every other time? Isn't that fair? Doesn't that show that she is invested in him too? What am I missing here?",dating
892,"Is wanting to date a woman with a healthy body composition an ""unrealistic standard"" for a normal man?","According to medical publications, a man with higher than 17% body fat and a woman with higher than 32% body fat are both classified as ""overfat"" which is a condition of high enough body fat to no longer be healthy. I think health and fitness are important. I work out every day (biking, swimming, weights, or body weight) for 30-40 minutes. I practice intermittent fasting and try to eat mostly healthy foods. My body fat is around 14% and going down slowly over time.

I would like to date someone similar to me who also maintains a healthy body composition. I asked about this yesterday, and the answers I got all essentially (and angrily) said that it is unrealistic for a normal man to expect to date someone similar to him in this regard.

The answers said that a woman with a healthy body composition has so many options she will demand the man be tall, or white, or beautiful, or look like he's on steroids. I am none of those things.

Thus I was told I should not expect to date anyone similar to me. Parallel to that, someone in another thread suggested I also increase my exercise to 10 hours per week (1-2 hours per day) as I'm not getting exactly the endurance and strength I want from my current routine. I'm considering it but I also fear that this will just disconnect me from the women I am able to date further.

If I am working out 10 hours a week, I am concerned the prospect of meeting someone compatible likely goes down not up. Although my fitness might improve somewhat, since I'm still not going to be using steroids, I likely won't reach the movie star physique threshold. Thus I won't get the benefit of standing out against the steroid users on apps. At the same time, my lifestyle will become even more abnormal compared to the average sedentary person.

What do you think? Is wanting to date a woman who similarly maintains a healthy body composition with a lifestyle like mine an unrealistic lifestyle standard? Do you think going up to 10 hours of exercise per week might make it better or worse?",dating
893,Men’s advice. Understanding and following basic attraction rules doesn’t make you manipulative. Not putting a woman at the center of your universe doesn’t make you a jerk,"To be clear, there is a lot of manipulative behavior that is promoted when it comes to attraction. It typically involves exploiting insecurity and using subtle tactics to degrade.

However, often times this type of behavior is conflated with being successful with women in general. There’s a perception that success with women is in inherently tied to deception and narcissism.

If a man understands that he should text with restraint, mirror behavior, be playful and tease while still being respectful, utilize subtle touch to escalate emotion, dating as much as many people as possible until a relationship is established, this doesn’t make him manipulative because he understands the true nature of attraction.

Some guys are labeled ‘jerks’, when in reality they simply aren’t Nice Guys, and neglect all other important components of their lives for a woman. They have integrity and are upfront with their feelings, but are still seen as jerks because they have boundaries and aren’t pushovers. Yes, a lot of assholes are successful with women, because their behavior is often confused with with assertiveness and masculinity. However, a centered, respectful man can still be assertive and strong.

There’s a contradictory expectation of men nowadays. Women revile and reject the Nice Guy, but it is also expected to be our default setting as well. When a man deviates from what society tells us is the proper way to win a woman over, i.e. through unwavering devotion despite any behavior she may throw at him, he is traditionally labeled as a jerk.

Remember, a good majority of behavior that is attractive to women runs counter to what society has conditioned men to believe through Hollywood and other forms of media. If you have authentic respect for someone and who they are, and don’t engage in behavior for the sole purpose of getting a specific reaction, you aren’t being a jerk. Especially if you have acted like a Nice Guy all your life, not immediately responding to a text or disagreeing upfront might feel uncomfortable, but it is how attraction really works in real life.",dating
894,Why are short women and tall men so picky in the dating scene?," 

Both groups of short women and tall men have the weirdest height preferences even from what i've seen. Short women usually below like 5'4 sometimes have a minimum height requirement of at least like 5'10, in a lot of cases even minimum 6 feet. If a guy is taller than them but they aren't ""average or above"" they are ""too short."" Reverse this with tall men. I've seen tall men say that women that are 5'6 and up are ""too tall"" because they are not ""short"" and they only like ""short"" women so they only like a certain range that is ""short"" to them even though a 5'8 woman is 8 inches shorter than a 6'4 man she is not ""short"" because she is considered a tall woman.

I've even seen tall guys literally state that they only like women under 5'4 and they actively reject women that are 5'4+ because they are literally not short by the countries standards. Oftentimes both requirements of these groups meet and then they usually gloat how much better they are than other groups respectively. Other people like short guys, average girls, tall girls and average guys aren't usually that strict about height, its usually the short women and tall guys tbh.",dating

900,What you need to attract a woman,"1. Women love a fit body on a man. You will have to go to the gym and give up your favorite foods for a while. 

2. Women love it when a guy is good in bed. You fuck her good and she will look at you like a God.

3. Don’t be boring. You don’t have to have the best personality. If you are good looking you don’t have to be that funny. Women will laugh at your not so funny jokes just because they are physically attracted to you and don’t want to lose your attention. 

4. Do nice things but keep it at a minimum. Do it enough to keep their interest. If you do it too often they will view you as weak. Don’t be a pushover.

But no one would do that. Because we all think we have some kind of value that demands something better than that. In other words, we respect ourselves to a certain degree. We don’t think we are worthless. So we refuse to treat ourselves like we are worthless.

So feeling entitled is actually **healthy**!! That’s literally what self esteem is. What’s bad is when there is a discrepancy. Either you don’t value yourself as much as you should or you value yourself more than you should. But who the fuck is anyone to tell you how much you should value yourself at the end of the day?

Even if it's only one or two dates with a week of texting, sometimes it's fun just to dive into someone else's life for a couple weeks. I get ghosted, unmatched, etc like everyone but it just means they weren't interested so who cares? On top of that, in what other world can you just browse potential matches from the comfort of your toilet?!

I dont know. I haven't found that person that makes me stay up at night, but I've had a lot of fun with people that I know I would have never met otherwise. I feel like OLD gives me options to find a more suitable match rather than trying to work something out with a person I meet through friends or the bar or w/e. Most of the apps I can tell what theyre into, their religious/political views, wether they have kids, etc before even deciding if I want to swipe on them.

905,People who post about politics on their dating profiles are usually crazy.,"I’m not referring to political affiliation: liberal or political affiliation: moderate or whatever it may be. 

I’m talking about people who need to frequently post about equality or I’m a career oriented woman..if you can’t handle me, swipe left. 

In today’s world, most women are career women. Rent costs $2k a month for a 600 sq foot apartment where I live...how the fuck can you survive if you’re not career oriented. The average single family home where I live is $1.6 million. Childcare costs $2k a month where I live. If you don’t bring money to the table, it’s a struggle to survive and raise a family in today’s world. Being a housewife today isn’t practical in most coastal cities in America where the jobs tend to be. The fact that someone needs to have their dating profile consist of I’m a career woman and if you can’t handle me, swipe left rather than other parts of himself or himself already raises red flags..to me, a person posting this kind of stuff on their dating profile is stubborn and selfish. 

As for equality, obviously this along with racism are systemic issues but bringing this up in your dating profile? Maybe if this is your job or if you spend a lot of time helping women or oppressed people, then posting about equality is great...but otherwise...you come off as an arrogant complainer. Unfortunately most people who feel the need to talk about equality are in the latter.

910,"For women, find the guy who is ok with your past and mention it early so you dont waste your time.","Its always the same thing. Most women are lied to or are naive enough to think their ""wild phase"" wont matter or shouldnt matter. But the reality is that it matters. To almost ALL MEN. No man wants to wife the girl who has banged the whole neighbourhood.

Most men dont get to bang as many women as they want but women do. Its a LOT LOT easier for women to get laid and I dont think most women get this. If most men arent banging girls, then who is? Its always the ""hot guys"" or the ""rich guys"" that bang women on their 1st date and move on to another because women let them bang. Now imagine it from the man's perspective. He meets one of this guy who you banged on your first date with minimum effort from his side. Say he is his co-worker. How would he feel? He is with a girl that he shows so much care and affection for and worked so hard to win her over, who was banged and disposed of by this guy. He didnt have to put in effort to get your girls attention and love and here you are trying your best. You feel like a sucker.

Finally, it not about the sex. Its about your virtue and morale and how you are as a person. Almost all guys wont have a problem if you have slept 1000 times with your ex- long term bf who loved you or your ex-husband who died but will have a problem if you had sex just 10 times with 10 different men. That just means you are easy and not valuable enough and to spend such time and dedication to win your love makes him a sucker. And the only reason men say they are ok with your previous partner is because they know , nowadays they cant find a women without it. They dont like it but they dont like the alternative of being alone either. Between a high number woman and a low number woman, almost all men will always choose the low number woman. Obviously, personality and other factors also play a role in a relationship but if he could find the same version of you with less number, he will choose the less number.

Also, I find it ironic how most women here dont like being judged on their past but judges the guy for wanting a girl who hasnt slept around. At the end of the day, its your only life and you should live how you want. But its also important to understand the possible consequences for your actions. Its important to see the world for what it is then what it should be like, according to you.",dating

912,I'm a 26yo Male and I no longer see any point in dating,"  Heres why:  
 

1. Sex is just not worth the time or effort it takes to get it 

It seems like this is the driving force behind most of the interactions I have with women. Most of those interactions are pulling teeth just to get them to engage meaningfully in the conversation. They always complain ""guys only want one thing"" - The reason for that is most women don't have much going on upstairs anyway, and the ones that do are usually to introverted to open up because they're afraid of 'being too smart' or whatever. 

The only thing worse than a woman playing 'hard to get' is the ones that throw pussy at you - which honestly just makes me feel like they might have AIDS or serious daddy issues, so its just a huge turn off when things move too fast. Finding a woman that is well adjusted, with a healthy sexual appetite, and limited baggage, that isn’t already taken is impossible. You have to bite the bullet somewhere and her flaws only become more apparent as things progress. 

Sex doesn't make up for the minefield you have to tiptoe through to get a mediocre blowjob and some starfish action. It just seems like most women have the attitude that 'you should feel lucky to get anything at all'. I don’t know if it’s just a lack of attraction to me but judging by the loads of women who report having very few or no orgasms at all - It seems they have little interest in sex and just use it as a bargaining chip for resources and attention. I always end up feeling like I’m begging for a treat from someone I’m not the least bit interested in as a person - but I’m left with virtually no other options. 

2. My efforts rarely feel appreciated

There seems to be an unequal amount of effort being put forth - just seems like no matter how things are going she always has other, maybe even better options, and she just keeps me around because Im available - but at the end of the day, if things go sideways there’s ten other dudes ready to take my place in an instant. 

""I could have another You in a minute, As a matter of fact he’ll be here in a minute” - Beyonce 

I’m completely disposable – nothing I do will ever amount to anything more than momentary pleasure for her, and the entire dynamic is set up to serve her needs over mine. Everything from paying for dates, to buying gifts, to paying her compliments, to listening to her problems, and waiting on her hand and foot is all about keeping her happy at my expense or else. It would be ok if it were 50/50 but it just never is, and if you make too much fuss about wanting equal treatment – they just default to ‘you’re the man, that’s your job’ or ‘if I’m not good enough for you then leave’ at which point you are replaced. Its never that quick and easy for the guy – no matter how successful he is, and even then, you just end up with another woman that expects the world in exchange for what ever she decides to give him no matter how small. The man seems to be expected to ‘feel lucky’ just to be with anybody at all, were as the woman needs to have all her needs met at all times or else the guy is a selfish piece of shit, that doesn’t know how to please a woman and will likely be replaced soon. God help you if you marry her and have kids and get dragged through family court to have your wealth stripped from you under threat of imprisonment. Its just a raw deal as far as I can see.

3. Relationships are more maintenance than fun

Even if you manage to maintain a stable relationship – it’s a grind from day to day just to keep the plates spinning, and the situation usually blows up in your face anyway. After all the communicating, and bonding, and planning you do as a couple – you’re always a few bad days away from a breakup. You can try to hang in there an ‘make things work’, but its never going to be as easy as just not starting one in the first place. Once the initial sexual attraction wares off I just find myself sitting next to someone I don’t really have anything in common with but am committed to and obligated to keep. Maybe some superficial things like our shared taste in media or politics – maybe we have a similar out look on life or a similar lifestyle, but they’re their own person, with their own thoughts and motivations. Its only a matter of time until you conflict on something major and it takes a toll on your own happiness. When stuff like this happens, I just feel like I need time apart to think about our future together and how to follow through on it. But then they get super needy and clingy like im about to break up with them, which just drives me away even more. It always comes down to a ‘its me or your own happiness’ kind of vibe – so I just bail and end up feeling a weight off my shoulders when its all over. 

Why bother carrying a boulder uphill against the wind just to have it whine that youre not working hard or fast enough to get to the top of the hill?? Much easier to just drop the boulder. Maybe I just don’t feel the need for companionship enough to suffer through all the drama? Its so nice to wake up in the morning knowing I can do as I please, when I please, and for my own sake and happiness without feeling guilty for prioritizing myself over a partner the way women often do.

4. Having children seems borderline immoral and selfish

How many kids grow up in broken homes, raised by stupid parents, that have no idea what they’re doing? They give their children a series of hang ups and mental illnesses that they inherited from their awful parents, as they try to either live through them vicariously or just completely drop the ball raising them and outsource their responsibilities to other people. Children are mostly raised by the public school system and the media – parents are either overworked trying to provide for them, or just fucked up and accidently got pregnant and had them with no plan or purpose as to how they will live their lives. The world is full of toxic adults that all started out as neglected children. No thanks – I don’t want that responsibility and pretending like im just magically going to be a way better parent than all the other idiot parents is naive. Plus, I don’t want to lose half my paycheck in child support once my spouse starts prioritizing the kids over our relationship and looks for a more affluent provider.

5. Online dating is just exacerbating all these issues

Seriously – that shit is insane how its totally set up to advantage women. I don’t need to go into detail about the ghosting, using people for free food, sugar babies, and just straight up insane behavior and expectations put on men in these arenas. There are thousands of articles on this shit and it’s all true. Ive used Tinder, Bumble, Badoo, Pof, Hinge, Blk people meet, Scout, Clover, etc, and theyre all terrible.

Im about to buy a sexdoll and call it a life tbh – I look forward to getting a dog and enjoying being single until the death of me. Ive been a man whore, Ive been married, Ive committed, and cheated, And the whole experience of dating, sex, and relationships has left me feeling completely disinterested in continuing.

915,"(22M) Guy I’m (20F) dating exclusively got a girl’s number at a party he went to, and doesn’t understand why I’m ending things","I’ve been happily seeing a guy for several months, and while we aren’t in a relationship, I’ve made it clear that if he doesn’t want to be exclusive he can leave. So, I thought he understood that. 

I recently got a text from him saying he was at a party and got a girl’s number. I don’t know if she offered first or he asked her, but it doesn’t matter too much to me. I got angry because the conversation that followed between us implied that he was romantically interested in her. The thing is, he wasn’t telling me this to break things off so he could date her. He just wanted to inform me that he did this, but wanted to continue seeing me and was shocked at my reaction. I have no idea what response he wanted or expected of me. 

Since this obviously showed that I wasn’t treated or seen as exclusive with him, I basically told him to screw off and just go date the new girl. I’m not interested in partaking in some “competition” where this guy potentially flits around between girls to see which one he likes best, then to ditch the others. I told him I’m not okay with that, and felt as though the fact he stayed for a few months meant he had the same opinion. 

Breaking things off made him lose his mind. In text form he started pleading for me to reconsider, and kept asking why was this a dealbreaker/making me upset because in his words “it was just getting her number I didn’t even go on a date with her yet.” Uh not literally yet, but it implied he was interested in getting to know her romantically, what a dipsh*t.

I left my phone alone hoping he’d run out of steam but he then started blowing my phone up with calls, with texts asking me to “just talk to him” in between. That’s when I finally blocked him. This just turned out unnecessarily crazy, I wonder what was going through his mind the whole time.",dating

Loved all his pictures, found him attractive etc. Our date comes up  and although  he makes me laugh a lot (which I like), takes care of the bill , appreciates my time, compliments me and appreciates my humor, we have an amazingly deep intellectual conversation, has a great career etc, I cannot get over the fact that he is not my physical type in terms of height. Turns out his online photos make him look taller. He's interested and wants to hang out again but I don't want to have the conversation of letting him down only for him to ask me why.

I dabble in Information Security as part of my job and as a hobby, so I thought I’d take a moment to contact her on Facebook.

919,What's wrong with Canadian women?,"I am Canadian, but lived in the Netherlands for most of my adulthood in a student city (in a program with mostly German girls). 

During my first year as a student, I had constant sex with a girl for half a year, then slept with 2-3. In my second year, I slept with 8, and met my current gf, the hottest piece of ass I've ever seen. We've been together 5 years. She let me sleep with other girls, sort of, but I also cheated a few times. During my bachelor, I slept with a dozen girls mostly German, all between 17-22, all 7s and above (only one ugly, and one being the hottest in our program). Half of them I met from Tinder. I got twice as much nudes, and blew my chances to be with a lot more. Some of them actually wanted to date me seriously. 

Coming back to Canada, my gf lets me sleep with other girls because she's not possessive and she used to let me go to hookers in Holland so she just doesn't care. However, chirp chirp, my Tinder is like I'm shadowbanned. 1 match a month (obese girl), and that's it. In my new university, nothing at all. Didn't meet a single girl, except for a weird French girl who paid me drinks and touched my thigh but didn't want to make out (and another thot with wrinkles). I slept with a Canadian immigrant last year, and a 17 year old three years ago, my only Canadian girl since 2013. So since two years, I had less activity than in my worst 4 months in the Netherlands.

So what's up with Canadian women? Where are they? I realized that not only the most sex I've had was in Europe, but the most sex I've had in MY country is from my gf visiting for a month every 6 months. There was such an abundance in Europe that the most sex I've had in Canada was from Europe.

What's up with that?

Well if I look around me I kinda have an answer to my question. My generation in Canada is mostly immigrants hanging amongst themselves, and the few white women are like my sisters, either being only into non-white immigrants or having multiple short term flings. 

The best part is that I'm 177 cm, which is shorter than the average woman in that province of the Netherlands.",dating

I just have a hard time believing that this is a *sincere* trend. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but I just think a lot of people (more prominently women, it seems to me) have labeled themselves with these sexual orientations to lure people in or to show that they are (falsely) open-minded.

His kissing was a huge turnoff. I remember him telling me I was a good kisser. I was trying to guide him and let him know what I like without having to tell him. He’s way too aggressive with his tongue and was just sloppy. He would put his lips to mine and just throw his tongue in my mouth. I’m totally big on PDA but I don’t want to be sloppy kissed like that in public I did ask him to refrain from out in public and he obliged.

She responded telling me I had a nice two toned penis and it reminded her of a butterfinger. Luckily the pics didn't have the wild dingle berries in them. We then proceeded to talk on occasion. Then it comes to a point where we exchange numbers. Around Christmas time I jokingly told her I am going to get her a gift. She said I will get you a gift too. Mind you I never met this girl in my life. It's already hard enough for me to spend money on someone I care about but someone I never met I think not. FaceTime her a few times to assure she was a woman. Christmas came and I got a big ass package in the mail she actually did send me something. I felt guilty I didn't buy her shit. Made up excuses and told her the mail system must be fucked up or something. Finally sent her a gift she loved it at least I think for my birthday she sent me 300 in twenty dollar bills by mail I was excited and felt guilty taking money from a girl. Now I told her I had school bills to pay which I do and she proceed to send another 500$ that week.

At the end I went in for a kiss and got the cheek and was told ""I like to wait until it feels natural"".

I few years ago I broke an engagement to a girl I was with for 7 years because she just didn't show me enough passion or affection. Since then I have dated many girls for whom affection is enjoyed much more freely and those early signs translated into every day life with them; from little gestures like stroking my hair while watching a movie, to wild passionate sex.

So I read a lot into the very early signs of how someone treats physical affection and I am very paranoid about falling into a relationship again with someone who is uptight about affection and sex and so on. So I am taking this as a hard red flag, not really worrying about why it is she rejected it but just taking it as a sign things would not progress to a really physical passionate kind of relationship.

So many men out there are looking to waste a woman's time and extract gf benefits or casual sex without any intention of true interest. It makes it easy for them if they don't have to put any energy or time or money into it. So I make it ""expensive"" for them to waste my time. Last minute dates? Asking to come over? Asking to go on a walk? Even coffee or ice cream is a huge NOPE.

Men, dgaf what you think about this. Because I know all of you will complain because this makes it harder for you to get what you want from us for free. Women, take note and aim higher.

I personally dont know if its good or bad to want and desire relationships and sex.

Here is a thing i noticed, i get demonized for desiring dates... i get told im disturbing for wanting dates and sex.

I want sex within a relationship, im told this is disgusting and women dont want relationships anymore! Not only this, but ive had friends who were women, who would... just kinda randomly have sex with hot guys, but tell guys like me i ""need more money"" or ""Need a better job"" or i need more hobbies and so on.

I have brought girls over to my friends houses just to be left in the living room while he gets his dick wet real quick FOR FREE for NO REASON.

While for me sex is on a condition i meet a bunch of prerequisites? why?

You wanna know what their hobbies are? Smoking weed, and sitting at their parents basement, and girls FUCK THEM. FOR FREE, while im told im not working hard enough.

I have tried the online dating route, and have had, tinder, bumble, hinge, match, meetme, POF, eharmony, badoo, and... i think thats it. Basically i have an account on every main stream dating site, and never get matchs.

But what’s the point in ghosting, especially if you had some connection with the guy? Why can’t we get some confirmation before you wanna end things? Why does it have to be a shitty mental race in our head before having a shitty realization at the end of the day that they didn’t even care enough to let you know that they detached?

I don’t believe all men are entitled to affection/relationships, but I think if a girl goes out of HER way to show affection and shows that she cares about a guy, then the guy is entitled to know when the girl wants to detach at the very least. Or is even asking for that too much?",dating
939,am I allowed to feel upset that he's seeing other girls?,"Honestly I'm sick of this situation I've been in but I don't know if I should let go or try harder, but I've been talking to this guy\[28\] for about 2 months, and so keep it short I have been feeling like on a rollercoaster.. I like him and I know that he is interested for the least.

However he has literaly not asked to meet up yet, YES WE HAVE NEVER MET, he lives 3 hours away but I feel like it shouldn't be a freaking excuse.

A few days ago I straight up told him what my intentions were, that I am searching for something for something serious and I'm not playing, I asked him what his intentions were with me, because I had doubts if he just liked me as a friend, or is just playing with me or is searching for something serious. He said that he would never speak to a girl just for fun or to waste her time, and he added "" I want us to get to know each other and see how it goes"" .. so I took it as he wants to take it slow considering he had been hurt in the past.

i dont know why but I have a feeling he's talking to other girls.

So the latest thing that happened today is, he texted me in the morning and we talked a bit then, and then he stopped replying and now it's been 5 hours, which has never happened before, however I check that he just posted a story, if it's not hurtful enought that he's been online and not responding, the story was a video of a table of food and I noticed 2 glasses, and I immediately thought ""is he on a date?""

I need help please, an analysis of the situation, and if anyone has advice for me on what I'm supposed to do with this last specific situation, as well as the talking, should I just assume he will never come around and move on?

edit: turns out yes he was with a girl yesterday, but he later texted me ""oh hey i was at the beach with some friends this afternoon""

**edit : I am writing here literally asking for support and the comments who are making fun of my attitude and belittling my reaction are not helpful at all, if you don't have something genuinely you think is helpful to say then please don't make someone feel stupid for the questions they are asking considering that you don't know the full story.**",dating
940,I met my soulmate but I'm not attracted to him..,"I don't know what to think anymore. I met a guy who is just the sweetest, kindest most caring and patient human I've ever come across. He's also intelligent, athletic, and he makes me laugh all the time.. he's the closest friend I've ever had in my life and I feel like I've known him all my life even though we met 8 months ago. I never feel judged by him no matter what and he's just the sweetest person. 

The problem is. I'm just not physically attracted to him. I don't want him sexually, he's just not my type at all. For one, he has a beard and I hate beards, and I just don't feel anything sexual about him.. 

Sometimes I hate this because we have such a special connection and it's like why does it have to be like this!? He is attracted to me. We've had many conversations about it. 

I don't know what to do.. people around us see our chemistry and always instantly assume we're in a relationship. 

We've cuddled a few times but that's it, we've never kissed or anything. Idk why I'm posting this I'm just a bit lost. I want him to stay in my life but I get the feeling that pretty soon he's not gonna be around anymore because he's too heartbroken that I don't feel the same way about him.. 

Any advice or anything? Similar experiences? Did anyone have real doubts like mine before going for it and it ending up really good? I need opinions !",dating

942,Do men almost always prefer larger breasts over small ones if comparing the two? (20F),"I (20F) know this probably gets asked a lot but this is a specific situation. My best friend and I have really similar faces and we act really similarly (we both act kind of weird). But I can't help but worry that guys would almost always pick her over me because she has big boobs (DDD cups or something, she told me at some point, and she's average weight i.e. softer body type) and I am a 32C but very thin (I have Zendaya's body type basically, just a few inches shorter).

I know if a guy is looking for a relationship, he will obviously think about the personality. But strictly based on body, would a guy almost always pick a girl with a large chest over a girl with a small chest? I ask this because we are so similar EXCEPT for our boobs, and it makes me feel really insecure. Someone choosing someone who looks like me, instead of me, is my biggest nightmare. I never was insecure about my body, because I have a very good body in society's terms, but in terms of attractiveness to guys, I feel like my body sets me back a lot. But I'm not sure if I'm worried for nothing, which is why I'm asking.

TLDR: If given the option between breasts on the smaller side vs breasts on the larger side, will a guy usually pick the larger breasts (without being ginormous I mean)? Not for a relationship, but just for sex.",dating

944,Left him on read once and now he leaves me on delivered forever,"I’ve been talking to this guy for only a couple weeks, so not very long. Before leaving him on read, he would always respond within 10-30mins. But the reason I left him on read is because he gave me a dry response. He did end up double texting, but started leaving me on delivered between 5-23 hours ever since then. There was a couple of times since this started happening that I was drunk and sent him videos/pictures and he would respond super fast. Even last night I sent him videos of me talking and he responded pretty quickly, but then today I’ve been on delivered for 14 hours.

So I’m curious if y’all think he lost interest or is trying not to come off as clingy? Or is he just playing me?

And should I bring it up at all? or would it be too early in us talking to say something about that since he’s technically not my boyfriend or anything yet.

945,Do women typically experience this with dating?,"

I just don’t understand how I fail to attract a man that I want. I know I’m 28 but am 100% certain that I’ll end up alone. I know I’m not beautiful but should be able to attract a decent man. I’ve been on and off the dating apps for years with no success, here’s my luck: 1) the attractive guys are just flighty/want sex, 2) the decent looking guys that have a decent personality are just too short for my preference and 3) the ones with the good personalities are just not attractive. It’s always fizzling out, lack of interest (goes both ways), ghosting etc. Why can’t I find a guy that’s tall, decent looking and not a dick? I mean I’m not morbidly obese, I’m thick but I thought there’s guys who dig that. Even a little slimmer, men did not talk to me. I lost a lot of weight 3 years ago assuming that would result in more attention From the opposite sex and it hasn’t. Is this common or is there just something terribly wrong with me? I don’t feel the urge to have casual sex, I don’t really care for sex much at all. I don’t even masturbate, the only guy that I ever “dated” was just not attractive and I was so angry that I couldn’t get better. I’m glad that ended, I know my worth. I’d rather be alone than settle and be miserable, I live by that.",dating
946,"Any stories about men saying ""I love you"" first where it worked out long term?","So I've come to believe that the reason a man should wait to say ILY is that women need to feel safe in a relationship, and part of that is the psychological safety of knowing that you and your SO are falling in love at the same time.

  
Meaning, a woman doesn't want to date someone who is falling in love with her faster than she is with him - this creates an imbalance where she feels pressure to make decisions because she doesn't want to hurt you.

&#x200B;

After failing last time, my current position is: I'll never say ILY first, I'll just find non-verbal ways to let a woman know I love her and create that safe position where she feels free to say it because she loves me, too.

Saw another topic on this recently and I'm really curious if there's any kind of majority consensus one way or another.

For me personally as a man, I will pay for dates either to be kind or because I know I have to deal with people's ingrained sexist biases and it's easier to just play along for a date or two until things even out. In general though, I refuse to date any woman without a career/financial independence. Not much turns me off more than a grown woman who is totally dependent on others, and having a relationship with someone like that seems borderline pedophilic to me. As if she is a child who is incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people for everything.

I've heard tall men say to my face that women a foot shorter than me like 5'0 are more ""fun"" and cute. It's more common for me to see tall men with women about 18 inches shorter than them than with tall women. I've have heard tall men mention dick sucking height and other weird things. No other men have I ever cringed and gotten weirded out with and tall men are great examples of men that give me that feeling.

957,"PLEASE READ, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE!!! A warning to men. Learn who you are before it is too late.","Let me prefaces this with I never thought I would be writing something on reddit. But I felt this was too important not to share.  I am writing this post for two reasons. One to help men who might be on here, to help them learn from my mistake so they don't lose the greatest love of their life. And two, that the person I hurt might read this and find it in their heart to speak to me again one day.

I met the greatest love of my life online back in October 2021. She was stunning, and gorgeous, and smart, and strong, and independent.  Just amazing. We went to a movie for our first date, she was even more stunning in person. We got hot and heavy quick. Everything was electric. I felt so comfortable with her. I couldn't stay away. The second week we were together I spent the night every night lol lost a lot of sleep because I had to get up extremely early to get to work. I knew I wanted to marry this girl, I was going to marry this girl. I wanted to love her, comfort her, provide for her, take care of her, be loyal and honor her  The last good night we had together was Christmas Eve. That night will be burned into my heart forever.

But I started the relationship with a lie. I had hooked up with someone before I met her. She was a nice enough girl but I really wasn't attracted to her, just lonely. So when my girlfriend and I discussed previous relationships I made up a lie about my fling. At about the 1 1/2 month mark my girlfriend got cold feet and broke up with me.  Out of loneliness and desperation I reached out to my previous fling. She was down, but the very next day my girlfriend wanted to talk and we got back together. Now this previous fling, I came close to cheating on my girlfriend with her at the start of our relationship.  Hell, I might as well say I did cheat on her, though I never had sex with my fling while I was in the relationship; but it was so close that it might as well have been cheating. I ended up just ghosting her. So now that I was back with my girlfriend I had to get rid of the fling again. I had felt bad about ghosting her once, I didn't want to do it again.  I've never been in this situation before so I didn't know what to do. So I lied, I lied a lot. I led this other girl on, pretending to want to be with her while I was with my girlfriend. I made her think I was into her deeply, when I was really just buying time.  Eventually I just ghosted her again. She did not take kindly to that and started googling me lol. She found my facebook and the person I was in a relationship with then proceeded to send her screen shots of our text.  My girlfriend confronted me about it. I feared loosing the love of my life, I feared hurting the love of my life. So I lied, I looked her dead in the eyes and lied like my life depending on it. She knew I was lying. And for a month, she gave me chances to come clean and be honest, I just lied some more. Until she couldn't take it any longer and broke up with me on New Years Day. I eventually came clean but it was too late. She was kind though, agreed to wait a few day before she made a final decision. Unfortunately for me it was still to tell me to hit the road.  One of the last things she said to me was she forgave me and hoped we could be friends after some time had passed.

After all of that though, I was pissed, I was angry, I was full of hate for the other girl. I texted her and said a lot of terrible, disgusting, horrible things that I am ashamed of. No one should ever be told the things I said to her. I'm taking an educated guess that she also sent these horrible text to my ex-girlfriend. Because about two weeks after our break-up I had a sinking feeling something was wrong, my ex was hurt or in danger or something happened. So I reached out to her to make sure she was ok.  When I finally got through to her, the response I got was ""Stay away from me. Never speak to me again"". I have no idea what happened. But I found one of her post tonight. The things she said about me I found shocking, painful, hard to read. She said I was abusive, and narcissistic. Well, I never laid a hand on her. But if she felt I was abusive emotionally or psychologically, I didn't realize it, and her feelings are valid. I've never been diagnosed as a narcissist, selfish yes but I try to do better everyday, I suffer depression, and I have a personality disorder, I know these things and I'm honest about it, and I go to therapy for it to try to improve and be better.  But she does have a history of dealing with narcissistic people; so I have to take that to heart and believe it a possibility. I've tried to make amends with her. I sent her a two pairs of earrings, I told her I would take her to get her ears pierced but I kept putting it off. So I got her these earrings so when she did get them done she would have two nice starter pairs. But lol after what I read tonight she probably threw them in the trash without even opening the box.  

So the moral of this long winded novel is don't make my mistakes. J.J. was the love of my life. I've never been able to be friends with an ex before, never wanted to. But she is so important to me that I wanted her in my life. Now, I don't know if she will ever speak to me again. DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKES. Learn who you are. Find your flaws, work on them, improve them. Become a better person now. And when you find that person you love, don't ever lie to them. Be honest. Doesn't matter if you fear losing them or hurting them. Be honest always. There is never a good reason to lie.  Take care of yourselves, become better men.

J.J., should you ever read this; know that I am truly sorry and remorseful for everything I did. I read your comment and I took it to heart. I will be better, I will improve myself and work on myself.  I just hope you will forgive me one day and reach out a hand of friendship. Until this I love you, I miss you, and I wish you the absolute best. I hope you find happiness. Never settle for less than you deserve.",dating

I’ve never even been on a fucking date. I am apparently not dateable material. I’m not even sure anyone has even ever momentarily found me appealing in any way that you might say could be related to being dateable. I didn’t go to any dances or my Prom in high school. I never even so much as kissed a girl at a party in college. No one has ever wanted me to. I really believe that.

My positive attributes are not enough to override these things. My hobbies, my career as a doctor, my openminded and agreeable personality, anything else positive going for me. It’s not good enough. I am not valued. I am worthless.

I am sick of being worthless. I’ve been worthless my whole life no matter what I accomplish or who I become. It’s never good enough.

965,A complete misunderstanding of dating apps that some have.,"If you're a man who's either very average in the looks department or have some flaw that's not drastically made up for by something else, you need to come to an understanding about what you're probably gonna get from these apps.

I'll use myself as an example. I'm actually a pretty good quality guy in terms of ""mate value"". I'm 6' tall, decent face, got some muscle. I'm probably a 7 or 8 if not for the fact I'm a bit on the heavy side. But that's one flaw that's hard to get around until I drop a few pounds (which I'm already doing). 

I'm telling you right now the only reason I'm using tinder is for something casual. I plan on moving to another state later this year and I'm not looking for a serious thing at this point. But if I was, I would not go near any of these apps unless I was slimmed down quite a bit more. Because I know for a fact regardless of my build I can do better outside of OLD. 

I'm not saying cut your standards down to way below your league, but you have to manage your expectations. I realize some of these women are not the types I want to get too serious with, and I do my best not to mislead. But I also have a high sex drive and there's a major difference between a woman I'd have sex with a few times versus one I'd be with exclusively. And I'm not suggesting go have a bunch of unprotected sex all over town, but we all have needs. And the way some of you guys are complaining, my best guess is you probably need to get laid. 

If you're not willing to make some compromises vis-a-vis casual flings, you'd better quit relying too heavily on OLD or make sure you're on there looking like a hard 7 or better. And that's assuming you do everything else right, which isn't that hard to figure out. Like not double messaging/being needy, cringy messages, bios that make you look like an asshole, etc.

In a nutshell if you're not super attractive by the eye test, there's still probably a great woman out there for you. One you find incredibly sexy and great in many other ways. But all I'm saying is that same one who might find you interesting and attractive in person, probably wouldn't message you once on OLD if you even match with her. So if you're complaining about OLD not being what you expected, I hope I was able to give some insight as to what you should really expect. And hopefully you can make an informed decision of whether or not (or how much) you should be using apps.",dating
966,The best advice the men here are gonna get,"This is how your life should go.

1 month every year you should dip your toe into the water of dating, online or otherwise.

If after that month you're having trouble, flakes, ghosts, whatever, shut everything down.

The rest of your year is now for making $$$ and improving how you look.

Focus on no aspect of personal improvement but those two things.

Your personality is fine.

Who you are inside is great.

Nothing is innately wrong with you.

And when I say improve your appearance I mean...

Do.

Whatever.

It.

Takes.

Those improvements are the only improvements that matter.

And once you treat the game as it is you will begin to view it in the proper context.

Edit: 

To be clear, this is not the blackpill. We live in the most advanced age. There are so many options for you to improve yourself it's ridiculous. Just get the $$$.

Personality is supreme in relationships.

But relationship skills and attraction skills are pretty much orthogonal.

Attraction is primarily your looks. If you have problems getting interested people of the opposite sex, start there and only focus there: looks.

I'm relatively short around 5'2 and tbh I prefer guys who are like around 5'5?  I feel so shallow. I met up with this guy and he was already sitting down when I got to the restaurant and we actually had pretty good conversation (ie. I babbled and he humored me cause I'm nervous babbler haha) and he seemed like a genuinely good guy, but when he stood up I realized that he was kinda short and he was pretty much my height and it kinda turned me off of him. Ah. I'm so shallow I'm so sorry to you guys out there.

And now whenever I look at a guy's profile pictures I try to estimate how tall they are and then I get sad because I feel so shallow. I've had guy friends who struggle with dating cause of their height and I always try to comfort them, but then I feel like a hypocrite cause I myself don't want to date someone my height or shorter than me. 

Anyway this is just me venting. I'm sorry dude you're super cool. I'm just a shallow and superficial :'(",dating

969,18 year olds should be able to date 30+ year olds without social consequences,"There is a very strange status quo going on right now regarding 18 year olds being children that need protection apparently? This is not an old thing, as of the last decade or so it's become almost the status quo that 18 year olds are kids. I've seen some argue that even 21 year olds are kids. I have a buddy who's 32 dating a 19 year old uni student and they have fantastic chemistry and I don't even find it a little strange. Yet some of my friends go as far as to call him a total creep and far worse things. 18 year olds are adults legally for a reason, they're adults.

I'm over 30 and I think back to when I was 18, I had a pregnancy scare; was covered in tattoos and worked a full time 9-5 job and paid for my own stuff. Doesn't sound like a kid much to me, not sure where this status quo came from. It doesn't matter if you feel the maturity gap is too far, 18 is an adult, being rude and ridiculing couples for this is demeaning and downright upsetting.",dating

974,WHY do people think it's racist to have strong racial preferences?,"It's like saying it's homophobic to not be attracted to the same sex or transgender people. Seriously. I can't help I have literally 0% attraction to any and all black women and have a heavy preference to white - white-ish women. How is this my fault when it's not something I can help? I'll call you racist if you're not attracted to me. Ehy, see how dumb that sounds? People are all like ""but you're judging an entire group"" no.... I literally am not attracted to dark skin. I've seen literal thousands and thousands of black women IRL and many more via TV n whatnot. I've never found a single one to turn me on. Aesthetically pleasing yeah, in the same way I can look at a guy and recognize that he's good looking. But I'm 0% turned on by men. I'm not turned on by dark Indian girls either. I really only like my skin color and lighter. I'm also not a fan of natural curly hair or wide noses, any other type of nose is fine. I cant help it. Btw. I live in an area where over half the population is Black and 80 to 90% of the young people. So YES I've seen just about every shade, every height, weight, etc. Never been close to a single one.

And this is NOT even abnormal. It's very normal to have preferences to your own race. I'm not totally white myself I don't think. I'd probably count as ""Off-White"" or something. White ish looking but not totally white, I've got like olive skin color.

I'll also add probably most or at least half my friends are Black and I don't hate anyone based on skin color. N B4 someone else calls me a white supremacist.

I'll also add that I don't tell black women I don't find them attractive because they're Black. I pretty much do say "" Sorry, I'm not attracted to you. Hope you find someone though!""  It's just when I'm asked about it I give my honest opinion. ""Why do you never seem to find black girls hot?"" Why? Because I'm not attracted to black girls.

So I starting seeing all this 7 girls who acted single and being so flirty and all touchy and other stuff with me, they even get jealous when they see me with another girl. But I recently decide since I had been having a super busy semester to take a little break and went to look into their social media, it was kind of suspicious some stuff that I found and bang I end up finding they got a boyfriend all seven of them.. 

till this day they haven’t mentioned them at all lol... am I mad? Nah... it just sucks that these girl looks so innocent, shy and the faithful type and their boyfriend are blind that they been cheating on them for the past few months.

Don’t be judging me. I turned out to be this type of guy since even in an introvert college, girls are still willing to cheat. Reason why I’m still single and not willing to date..",dating
977,Ten things never to ask a woman,"David DeAngelo has come up with a list of ten dating tips to guide men on what they should never say to women.

The author of *Double Your Dating* says there is nothing worse than making mistakes that will later be regretted and one way to avoid them is to remember the following.

First of all, a man should never ask a woman if he can kiss her, as she will only say, a man should never ""ask"" for a kiss.

Asking her for a kiss will only make a man look like a boy, which is what a woman is not interested in, and even if she says ""yes"", it could mean she is just being polite, while on the inside her attraction meter will read a firm, ""No"".

Secondly, a man should never ask a woman if he can take her out on a date sometime, as she would like to be with a man who is a leader and in control, not someone who asks her permission to hit on her.

A man should confidently ask a woman out, by simply saying, ""We should hang out... what's your number?"" or tell her about a specific place he wants to take her to.

Thirdly, a man should never brag about the car he has or the kind of house he lives in, as it would seem like he is trying hard to impress her.

Women would be far more impressed by a man's material possessions if he does not mention them in conversation.

The fourth thing a man should never ask a woman is what she wants to do for the night, as she likes a ""man with a plan"".

The man needs to have a game plan before he calls her, so as to ensure that she will not be burdened with having to think about what to do.

Fifthly, a man should never ask a woman if she likes him, as this is one phrase that turns off a woman completely.

He should just assume that she likes him, and never ask the question, as it would look like he has no confidence.

The sixth tip is that a man should never ask a woman why she never answered his message, as one, it would show that he cared she did not reply back, and two, it would give her a guilt trip, which is seen as insecurity by women.

The seventh tip is that a man should never ask a woman how men she has slept with, as this shows that he is suffering from insecurity.

The eighth tip is that a man should never hint at a future date with a woman he has just met, as she not only wants but needs a guy who is somewhat of a ""challenge"", and will lose interest if she senses she has won.

The ninth tip is that a man should never end a phone conversation with a woman with a ""next step"", as firstly it would kill any spontaneity by being predictable, and secondly he would kill any chances of her calling him.

The tenth tip is that a man should never talk bad about a woman's guy friends especially if he hasn't met them and doesn't know her very well, as this is the fastest way for her to mark him as ""insecure"".

978,Advice for incels and other struggling insecure men (and women). Let me take you on a spiritual journey of self-discovery.,"Hi There, 

I am here to take you on a powerful spiritual journey, to get angry as fuck, enraged, and let out all that negative energy built inside of you.  This may take a half hour or an hour to read, but it means the world to me that anyone at all will read this, even if its just 1 or 2 people.  

as a recovering involuntary celibate myself, i had great great pain for the first 12 years or so.  I was just a wreck around women.  Never had a girlfriend or sex , and it caused so much pain for me.  I was so envious of other men, and i had a severe scarcity mindset.  It was awful.  But thankfully thanks to 2 powerful insights, i have turned it completely around for the most part of the past 2 weeks, and it was effortless and no competition at all was needed.  

So this spiritual journey of interacting with the other sex takes $0 money at all.  Yep, anyone who told you you wont get girls or boys cuz you dont have enough money, imagine kicking them in the balls 100 times as hard as you can, yep we're gonna be getting really fucking angry because we men have every right to be fucking pissed off at how we have been educated and brainwashed by horribly thought out advice, and i am here to try and put all of that horrible advice given on the intenet to extinction.  If i succeed in any way of that, i will be so happy!

So basically, start right now getting pissed off.  Do you have a gym with a boxing punching bag? if so go there right now if you arent there.  Or at least get something that you can beat the shit out of.  Take all that negative energy stored inside of you and we're gonna work to get it the fuck out of your system.  Again, get pissed and angry as you possibly can and beat the shit out of something, because you have every right to get raged as fuck.  

Ok so now we are going to go through a perspective change.  And first we are going to be unlearning everything we have been taught about (im going to go specifically for men here, but women will benifit from this as well) interacting with girls.  T**he whole here is going to be that we have disgustingly told men that interacting with attractive young girls who they like is basically rocket science.  News flash, ITS NOT.  Not at fucking all!** 

So imagine a horrible advice towards making yourself more attractive is on the punching bag or whatever it is your beating the shit out of.  what common advice have you been given towards attracting hot pretty girls? was it wear cologne for the purpose of attractive girls.  Take that topic and beat the shit out of it.  Did people seem to make it rocket science to ask hot pretty girls out? beat the fucking shit out of it.  Did people tell you to interact with girls differently than you interact with your best guy friends? Take that shit and beat the fuck out of it.  So go through every single thing you can think of that you been poorly educated from, and beat the fuck out of it.   

So why is it not rocket science? because its not rocket science to talk to girls, not in the slightest of slights.  You simply just talk to them and interact with them like you interact with young best guy friends.  Yep, ok now close your eyes, if you have time this may take a half hour or an hour.  I want you to think about a girl you love or you just find beutiful.  Maybe your scared of her because you have been educated to be scared of her and avoid her because she's like some high status goddess.  Thats complete utter bullshit.  Think of all the girls you love that got away because you we're educated to overthink and overcomplicate an extremely simple thing.  Now imagine those girls are your very best guy friends.  Again close your eyes, let your imagination wonder.  Imagine your girl crush is literally just your guy friend.  Want to go rough and play tackle football with the goddess? Go ahead.  Want to roast her with mean jokes and say just whatever comes to your mind without hesitation.  again, however you treat your best guy friends, even if there's rough play and mean teasing, directly translate this relationship type to the hot girl you love and gush over.  Make no hesitations at all, tackle her and wrestle with her and tickle her maybe even in the boobs, with no hesitation or passiveness at all.  If your having sex, yep jut go rough and tackle her and play with her boobs, and tickle her really good, like you are confident as fuck and like she is just your best guy friend.  Again **MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE WITH THAT HOT GIRL THAN YOUR BEST ROUGHHOUSING GUY FRIEND.  Just have so much unapoligetic mean and nasty behavior towards her, obviously im not saying to treat her like shit, im just encouraging you to have absolutely no passivity or overthinking in the slightest.  Keep doing this until you have absolutely no passivity or overthinking with your relationship with that really hot girl.  It is extremely simple.  Make it as simple as possible, because in real life it is this simple, no elebaration needed.**  

Ok now we are going to explore the misinformation thats been given out that hot girls are some sort a goddess that you like arent even worthy of talking to.  This is utter fucking bullshit in the highest form.  Don't overthink at all that its complicated to interact with them.  **Again, hot girls are the same fucking species as you, that means its really simple in the highest form to interact with them.  Don't ever let someone tell you to interact and complicate your attitude towards hot girl crushed you have.  Cut those negative incels who wont change out of your life.  Get all toxcicity out of you, you need to surround yourself with the kind of stuff i am going over.  Embrace whatever great widsom you come across that makes you feel better about you.  Have male role models, like keanu reeves, or brad pitt, or any guy you find inspiring and that makes you want to embrace your role models.**  

Ok and now with porn: porn is fine as long as its homemade porn.  N**ever ever ever watch porn that is not homemade, it is disgusting and a horrible form of human mutilation.  Never watch non homeade porn, cut the lifeblood out of those big porn industries, and embrace independant porn channels.  My favorite porntar is johnny sins.  Watch his homeade sex videos, that is incredibly realistic to how sex actually is, and he fucking great at it and the women are in complete bliss while he fucks them. And also you can explore other homeade porn videos that are just simply people filming themselves having amazing sex.  That aint gonna harm you at all, its the fucked up shit the porn industries do.**  

ok so now another thing that men have been miseducated on: That girls are only their hot appearance and nothing else.  Complete utter fucking bullshit, they are not all their looks.  They have layers, many layers.  Maybe that hot girl is interested in electrical engineerimg.  Maybe that hot goddness likes to go on big hikes.  Make that hot goddess love to explore nature and do marine biology.  Hot girls have many many layers to them and their appearance is just 1 out of like 1000 layers.  Yep, be very interested in the non appearance aspects of them, because maybe they are well educated and curious people.  Look through her appearance and be interested in what she is interested in.  Search for common interests, and if you cant find one then ask her more about the ones she is currently interested in.  If you do that, avoid appearance based interactions, it will be so much easier to strike up a conversation with them without looking like a creep.  

listen you are not a fucking creep.  You are awesome and you have every right to talk to your hot girl crush, don't ever let yourself think you are not worthy to talk to that girl, your awesome and cool, not a creep in the slightest.  Get that shit the fuck out of your system.  **Oh and also i like to imagine the girls get horny when they are around me.  Doing that helps take pressure off myself if i worry too much is they dont like me back.  So yeah convince yourself the girl gets horny when she's around you, or add any sort of positive talk to convince youself she likes you.  Keep doing this consistenty and you will probably see better results in worrying less about if your liked back**

And also, work on developing an **unconditional self love and an unconditional abundance mindset.  Work hard on switching from scarcity mindset to abundance mindset, because abundance mindset is so so critical to making yourself send a better mesage about yourself to others.**  

Ok one last thing, embrace humor to the highest level you can.  South Park, Comedy Central's roasts, the 5 hour Joe rogan, Alex jones podcast from 2019 are my favorite to keep me laughing,  Embrace the fact that you are fucked up, and develop a dark sense of humor about yourself.  **Again,** A dark sense of humor is a very attractive trait that you dont need any money for pretty much.  Instead of thinking about your lack of money, learn to laugh and embrace the fact that your life sucks.  **And then you can make these dark jokes to girls, and girls fucking love guys with dark humor, even if the guy is broke or poor as fuck.  If you can master being witty with dark humor, interactions with girls will be effortless.  So yeah, throw that money advice in the toilet forever, you can still get very very far being a bit broke.  focus on what you do have, not on what you don't.**  

There is so much more to you than your status with girls, you have other interests and hobbies to keep you busy. Get busy, very busy.  Find anything to keep you stimulated.  Any hobby or working enough, maybe work longer hours if you dont have hobbies right now, and that ok, **just work on yourself and believe in yourself, every single day.  Unconditionally love youself, convince youself you are abundant and funny and energetic and lively.  Surround yourself with people and show or movies that make you laugh and have a great time.  Humor is the best thing to persue here, and south park is the perfect show fot it.  Again surround youself with people you love.  Start loving people, and view others in a positive life.  Don't always be badmouthing, that fuels the deadly scarcity mindset.  Always embrace abundance, always.  So overall, you just need to feel better about you, and not try and put that attention on selling out to try and attract a girl for it.** 

I cant stress this enough, **never ever ever sell yourself out so that you can think that you are going to be more attractive to hot girls** even if its at the expense of your own spirituality.  B**e selfish as fuck and do what is best for you**, not the hot girls.  **Be a fucking selfish motherfucker who cares about you and your health first,** over anyone even the hottest of the hot girls.  Direct your attention away from the appearences of girls as much as you can, so yeah, get busy and work o**n something it is deadly to have too much time on your hands**, so yeah, **get fucking busy with anything, and hobby or project.  direct your attention away from the girls as much as you can, and doing that will free you up so much and take away lots of pressure.**  

**If your a sitting bum all day, please please, do something to work on yourself, anything, think about the person you can become if you just start with something.  Believe in youself and take one step at a time.** 

Ok so now just keep letting your mind run free and just imagine, imagine how you want your relationships with girls.  Just keep doing this until you feel like you have had a powerful. **And always keep working on unlearning everything you have been taught on hot girl success, and toss it in the fucking trash forever and take it to the dumbster immediately.  and just keep on unlearning it, and keep at it, never ever settle for less.  So again, it is extremely simple to interact with hot girls, and never overcomplicate something that is extremely simple.** If you read this, thank you so much, i am so happy that i followed my own advice. It means the world to me that you read this. I will shortly make another post about how to master dark humor that costs",dating

982,"When men say that women should lower their standards, they are talking about PHYSICAL standards","Often times when  a man suggests that a woman lower her standards, the response is often times something along the lines of ""I would rather be alone that been in a @##@ty relationship.""

Men aren't suggesting that women enter bad relationships simply for the sake of being in a relationship. In fact, they are suggesting quite the opposite.

Most of the time, when a man says that a woman should lower her standards, it is under the following circumstances-

1. The woman strives to be in a relationship

2. The woman has an incredible number of likes/matches on dating apps (in the thousands or tens of thousands)

3. The woman complains about the dating scene/lack of options (despite evidence to the contrary)

When men say that she should lower her standards, they are specifically advising her to focus on qualities that actual predict long-term relationship success, as opposed to merely physical qualities (like height, looks, etc.).

They are also not suggesting that a woman needs to date someone who she finds physically unattractive. For example, let's say a woman normally only dates guys who are over 6ft tall. Assuming that she is happy with her dating life, most guys probably won't say that she should lower her standards. 

However, if she is unhappy with her dating life, many men may tell her something along the lines of ""Hey....what about all of those guys that are 5 ft 11? 5ft 10? Etc."" Yes, they are asking that the woman lower her height requirements a whopping few inches, but merely as a response to the woman's dissatisfaction with her dating life. In other words, they are trying to remind her that there is more to a relationship than a man's height and looks, although she need not completely be detached from those qualities.

None of this has to do with oppressing women and their ability to choose mates. If a woman expresses that they are happy with their current boyfriend/dating life, you will hardly ever see men telling her to lower her physical standards. It just wouldn't make much sense at that point. It's only when women pass up potential partners on the basis of an inch or two, and then complain about how little quality options that they have, that some men try to bring a little daylight into her dating choices.",dating

I(26f) got into a bit with my friend(27m), and I expressed my frustration on working so hard and not really having much time to do the things I love and enjoy. My body, feet,back, neck is sore and aching. It was 10/10 pain yesterday. Plus, I'm going to college and trying to keep up with my work. 

I'm not just exhausted physically but emotionally  and spiritually. Growing up, I've always wanted a lifestyle where I get to enjoy my hobbies, being a housewife, taking care of my husband, and making his life easier. Have a little part-time job because I enjoy it not because I have to. 

I told my friend how I'd like to marry a wealthy man and how I'm going to get fit and be more visually appealing to attract the kind of man I want. Yes, love is important, but I've dated for love and nothing else, and it has gotten me used and abused. So, I re-organized my priorities and placed love on the side for a bit. If the man I'm dating is a great guy and wealthy, of course I'd love him. I believe in growing in love. I'm definitely not going to marry a shitty guy for money. 

I tried to explain that to him, and he didn't understand what I was saying and seeking. I'd love a traditional lifestyle being a housewife with hobbies and part time job and doing things at my leisure and taking care of my husband.

987,I asked my boyfriend for a prenup. And i think he hates me now. Any Advice?,"
Hello everyone I am Kate (29F) have been dating Adam (30M) for One year and four months. Last Monday something happened that basically made me lose him. Or atleast I believe I did. 

I called Adam Monday morning asking if I could drive him to a mall that is about an 30 minutes away. That we were going to meet my sister and her husband for breakfast there. The drive there was really fun. He was singing weird silly songs. He is such a dork at times.

(I really love this man, he literally meant the world to me. I honestly thought. We were going to get married in the future.)

Once we got to the Mall i called my sister to ask her where she parked so we can park in the same area.

(To be honest maybe it is my fault for the way I did things. Please give me your opinion.)

We parked and walked in holding hands and giggling and laughing. I really love him alot. We met up with my sister and her husband and walk towards the food court…

That is where everything happened!!!

We stopped right in front of a restaurant that still was not open so I can give him the good news. I wanted to tell him the good news in person. My family and I decided to open a Family business a little restaurant in the food court.
 

He didn’t take it that well. He stood there in shock. Didn’t say anything and stayed quiet for about. I’ll say an hour you were waiting for a delivery that time frame he said he was going to go for a walk. 

(he was just very silent, his body became very stiff, didn’t even say congratulations you just felt like he was angry, his vibes Atleast.) 

After like 15 minutes or so, he came back being the same guy I love. Holding me kissing my forehead saying congratulations. I whole personality change.

When the delivery came, we said our goodbyes in parted ways from my sister and her husband . In the drive home he was different is quiet. Then I don’t know where he said, and that he deserves 10% but it was fair if we ever get married or engaged for that matter.

At this point, I was really confused and I was overthinking. Without even a thought, kind of like word vomit, I said I want to prenup if we ever get married. 

(Note we are not even engaged. For anyone thinking the reason i thought i needed a prenup was because he demanded a 10% out of no where)

He replied with sure, “I am a truck driver so, I’ll make more money then you anyways.”
 
He also had the nerves to say that I am letting the little restaurant get to my head and making me moody and stuck up. 

I told him “ If I was stuck up, I would of acting like if since the whole journey started back in March” the rest of the ride was all in mute.

 
Once we got to my house. He got into his car and speed away. He hasn’t called or texted me since Monday.  And as of today, been three days and nothing. He is still sharing his location with me.

So what should I do? Any advice???",dating
988,My Boyfriend Talks to Me While I’m Sleeping,"My boyfriend talks to me in my sleep. He’s a bit shy and doesn’t express love verbally when I’m awake. We always take naps together. The other day, for some reason I decided to fake sleep. 30 minutes into our “nap” he checked to make sure I was asleep by saying “I love you” two times. When I didn’t respond (which made me feel terrible) he started humming. I’ve never heard him hum before. He doesn’t sing either so it made me very happy. When he stopped humming I would wiggle and he would start again. After a while he stopped and I pretended to be in a deep sleep. He said I love you one more time just to make sure. Then he started talking. It was small at first like “you’re so cute” and “I love snuggling with you.” He then went into detail about all the things he love’s about me. Like my arms or my hair or my face. He started talking about how happy I make him and then out of the blue said “I’m going to marry you.” I tried to contain my smile. He then he started going into detail of all of the things our house is going to have. Like cats and a greenhouse where I will have pretty flowers and a garden. It made me so happy that I started tearing up. Now I fake sleep all the time to hear him talk about things he’s too scared to tell me when I’m awake. I love him.",dating
989,I bet my sister 100 dollars that she couldn't get me a date on Tinder in 1 month...,"And today, at midnight I became 100 dollars richer! Lol! She just sent the cash.

Backstory: Im a 27 year old guy just FYI. About a month ago on the dot, my sister and her girlfriends were inquiring about why I'm not ""talking to any girls"". I told them the truth - ""I've never had any girl say yes when I've asked them out, nor has any girl ever shown me any interest.""

My sister suggested ""Why not just use Tinder? That will be easy to get you someone to talk to!"" 

I was like ""Are you kidding me? I'm literally invisible on dating sites.""

She said something along the lines of ""I'm gonna take some nice photos of you right now and get you a girl ASAP.""

I told her ""I bet you 100 bucks that you can't get me a date within a month. I've been trying for years."".

They all laughed and she accepted the challenge.

She took a bunch of photos for me wearing some nice clothes, made a profile for me with some funny/charismatic content, and here we are 1 month later, still dateless.  

She video chatted with me earlier saying that she couldn't believe how hard it was to get any matches, let alone get any of the girls to reply to me. She was also surprised at the rate at which some of the matches unmatched her once they received a nice message from her. I could tell how frustrated she was with the whole experience of dating as an unattractive dude (although she will never admit that I'm unattractive).

I'm not posting this to get any pity though. I personally think that this was an educating experience for my sister and her friends. I think that her Tinder account has over 1000 likes, so it was like two completely different worlds colliding. I actually think that now she understands my predicament a lot better, and I doubt that she will be hard on me for not having a girlfriend anymore. But only time will tell.

So anyways,  I might not be a ladies man, but I made some easy cash and now at least my sister understands me better 😂😂",dating
990,I told him I wanted to be his girlfriend.,"Everything happened so fast. 
We met on Tinder, went on a few dates. Each date kept me smiling and laughing the whole time… we had been chatting and texting, daily. It seemed so easy and seamless…. Not worrying who should text first, who should make the first move, no games or playing hard to get. After the 3rd date, we walked passed a fountain and we both threw in a coin and made a wish. My wish was to marry this man.  How did I know this after so soon? Not really sure to be honest. 

He came over last weekend and one thing led to another and we had sex. It was intimate sweet and I actually climaxed which usually take a while for me to do , ( several
Attempts at sex before I can orgasm) 

We woke up the next morning, and I just blurted out… “I want to be your girlfriend”

And he said, let’s do this properly…
“Do you want to me my girlfriend?!”

And I said “yes! Are you sure ?!”

He said “100 percent”


And just like that, I think I met my future husband.",dating
991,"Unpopular Opinion: Most men are totally okay with waiting to have sex, but they're scared of being friendzoned so they feel pressured to make moves on dates","I have a theory that a lot of men, including myself, feel pressured to drive things in a sexual direction while dating or else we'll wake up to a ""I think you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it"" text message.

Like when I'm going out on a 2nd date, I'm thinking ""I better kiss her goodbye by the end of this date, or else we'll be entering friendzone territory.  Nothing is more anxiety inducing than being in the middle of a 3rd date without having pecked yet.

996,I just want to thank all the girls/women who take things into their own hands and make the first move and make it super obvious,"I'm 28 year old guy and I've always been the one who had to make the fist step and it really never went anywhere. 

Few days earlier I went on a date with a girl who I've met in person just three times before. At first encounter she was friendly and energetic. When we met for the second time (with bunch of other friends) she was frolicking around, poking me and making dirty jokes here and there. I didn't get any of that... Then we exchanged few messages, she asked about my new work (retail) and if she could come by, I said sure, why not. We chatted until the closing hours and when I got home I got message from her if I wanted to go to the movies, zoo or literally whatever with her. And then it finally clicked. This never happened to me before so I was a little bit stupefied but I gladly accepted. We went to the cinema and then spent hours just walking around the city, chatting and laughing. When we parted ways I sent her message jokingly asking about how are we going to call this. She replied ""how about we call it a date?"" which was exactly what I wanted to hear. And we agreed on another date. We will see where it goes but it's really refreshing that we can be just so straightforward about it. 

So ladies, if you are interested in a guy, please be as subtle as a snowman in the summer, we really appreciate it. Even strong hints often go completely over our heads.",dating
997,I (27m) met a girl (29f) who is perfect for me on paper. But she’s saving sex for marriage. Advice?,"I’ve never liked anybody this much. We have so much fun together and get along so well. We’ve been dating for a few months now and I am seriously falling for this girl. The only thing is is she’s saving herself for marriage and the only form of release I get is jerking off onto her stomach. She won’t give me oral but is fine with receiving it. I totally respect her wishes in her decisions but it’s leaving me feeling sexually unsatisfied. I told her about my feelings yesterday and now she’s kind of giving me the cold shoulder. What do I do?

Edit: she’s had sex before and is no stranger to it. She had her party girl days and recently became Christian which influenced her decision to do this.

Edit 2: wow this blew up. I thought I should add that I just had a talk with her. She says that she doesn’t want to give oral because she’s worried about how long that will satisfy me. And if she does give me oral and it won’t keep me satisfied for very long. She said she really wants to actually. But is scared it won’t keep me satisfied for very long.

I also brought up the fact that I am not religious with her and she says that she “has hope that anyone can become religious and eventually believe what she believes.” 

I keep trying to tell her how this isn’t gonna work with me or with anyone who doesn’t share her beliefs in the future. And she keeps circling back to how she really wants to give me oral and how there’s more to relationship than just sex. Also, she says that she doesn’t believe the Bible says anything about foreplay. That everything besides penetration is on the table. That her belief is her own.

Edit 3: this is my final edit. Thank you to everyone who responded. This was incredibly difficult to do and after many tears I broke it off with her today. While part of me wishes that I did save myself for her, another part of me knows that I wouldn’t have been satisfied the whole time. Also I know that I’m not gonna convert to Christianity anytime soon. Sorry that I won’t be able to respond to everyone but it was a resounding “Red flag”. And I think you’re all right",dating
998,My little sister left my phone number for the cute waitress at a restaurant and somehow got me a date (?),"I took my sister to a restaurant I frequent the other day. She was feeling down so I thought I should treat her. While me and the waitress that usually takes my orders chatted away, she gave my sister some crayons and some papers to color on. Once we got our orders settled, my sister being autistic, interpreted me and the waitress chat as flirting. Granted, I did have a little crush on her, the waitress was pretty cute. But anyways, I tried to explain to her the lady was just doing her job. But she insisted that the she liked me and I should ask for her number. I gave her every reason in the book why that was considered rude, and could even make her uncomfortable. But she was insistent that the waitress liked me.

When it finally came down to leaving, my sister shoved one of her drawings into the bill booklet thing. I asked her what she drew for the waitress, but she said it was a secret. She was terrible at keeping it though because on the way home, she couldn’t stop snickering. When I managed to pry out what she thought was so funny, she admitted that she left my phone number in the bill with a picture of me and the waitress holding hands!

I was super embarrassed. I wasn’t exactly mad that she left my number since I’ve thought of doing it a few times. But I still had to pretend to be upset so she doesn’t accidentally get us doxxed or something. I told her that that wasn’t cool, and she promised not to do it again. And for the next few hours, I resigned myself to never coming back to that restaurant. That is, until the waitress actually texted me! Long story short, I have a date coming up soon. Though, I don’t see it really going anywhere, it’s still pretty nice.

Edit: since people seem to keep asking why I don’t see it going anywhere, I meant that I don’t EXPECT it to go anywhere. For all intents and purposes, I’m a parent to my sister. And at 24, most women I meet (understandably) aren’t about that life. And though my sister is good at masking being autistic in public, she drops it around me. She’s an arm full, and I love her. But realistically I don’t see anyone making the effort to be with me long term. But, that doesn’t mean I can’t try to find someone. I just keep my expectations tapered (:

Edit 2: Went on the date. It went great! My sister tagged along and we went to the mall together and had some ice cream. After I put my sister to sleep, the night ended in us hooking up. It was a nice (: But, it doesn’t seem like she’s looking for anything long term. However, she was interested in still having a fwb relationship with me. Emphasis on the friends part. She got along so well with me and my sister. Heck, she could be a special Ed teacher with how chill she was. Emphasis on the benefits too heh. From now on, she’ll be sneaking in more loaves of bread into my appetizers! As well as some other stuff lol. That’s more than I could ever ask for",dating
999,I agreed to be a fake date for a wedding and now she’s my real girlfriend,"I (M35) was scrolling through hinge when I saw a profile of a pretty girl (F28) and her profile said she was looking for a fun date that would be willingly to pretend to be her boyfriend to take to a wedding. I thought that was funny and honestly intrigued me so we end up talking and she tells me that her dad’s side of the family is pretty snobby and always poking at her for being single and trying to set her up with people so she just wanted to go to a family event without being bothered with 1000 questions. She said “it’ll be at a fancy place, open bar till midnight and free food if you’re down. You just need a suit, I’ll pick you up and drive.”  

I thought eh why not? Free booze and if anything, it’ll be a fun night and we’ll never see each other again after if it sucks. We ended up having fun, dancing all night but we left it as a fun night but we started talking regularly, going to get dinner, movies, etc. we became friends and then after 2 months I realised how much I liked her because the days I didn’t see her or talk her, I missed her. I told her how I felt and she admitted she had been feeling the same way but didn’t want to ruin our friendship in case I didn’t feel the same way but we have officially been dating for real this time now for a month.

1000,A lot of women would be fine with being friends with benefits if you guys were actually our friends,"I find myself in some situations, one in particular that recently, we went on a couple dates. We slept together then he says him he doesn’t want a gf. Whatever, he realized i wasn’t the one for him we both understood. We still talked to each other and hung out a few but it was like once a month. I ask him to do some things during the day and he declines. I get not wanting to see the little mermaid lol whatever.. sometimes i do find myself slightly resentful because while i do enjoy the benefits for the most part, we are not what i would consider friends.  And we only chill at night, at someone’s place.  It does bother me a bit because there’s benefit but not really friends.

If guys we’re actually friends with women.. It would be much more likely that women would sleep with you, instead of just doing the absolutely bare minimum and expecting it. Why not actually be friends with your fwb?",dating

I reply, “You and I are obviously not compatible. Best of luck on your search.”

I meant to follow up with a JK hating olives is not a deal breaker but got distracted by a work ping and forgot about the conversation and when I looked again a few hours later she had unmatched.

1002,This girl's spotter made the date super uncomfortable.,"So about two days ago, I went on yet another date(Over 20th one I've been on since November, Jesus Christ). I pulled up to the table the girl was sitting at and immediately noticed she had backup; sitting behind her was another girl who looked about the same age, just staring at her laptop with no headphones on. I understand why a lady would bring some reinforcements(There are some skeevy dudes out there), but it was about one in the afternoon inside a lively coffee shop, what really was I gonna be able to do? The worst part is, the spotter was sitting RIGHT behind my date and kept shooting me weird glances. I'd consider myself to be a fairly convivial person, but I was finding it very difficult to hold a genuine conversation when I know a third party is scrutinizing and judging my every word. Also, my date's boring and uninteresting talking skills were not doing me any favors. About twenty-thirty minutes in, I saw my date give her backup a look. The backup then proceeded to walk out. No less than a minute later, my date received a phone call where she then told me, and I shit you not, that her refrigerator was leaking and that she had to go. She then proceeded to get up and walk in the same direction her backup walked. All I could think was ""thank god that is over"". I have not been that uncomfortable in a while. I think I really need to take a break from dating.",dating
1003,"No, I will not lower my standards.","I hear it all the the time. That women are too choosy, that they want the moon and have nothing to offer for it. That if you want to be with someone you have to lower your standards. 

The truth is though. I've already had that relationship. The one where I did absolutely everything to make it work. He didn't make money? That's okay, I've got enough for both of us. He didn't have time to plan dates because of his job? That's okay, I can bring the romance. I was best friends with his family,  with his friends, fucked him regularly, worked out, had my own hobbies, my own life and made sure he was a big part of it. He still cheated. He still criticized everything I did. He still brought my self esteem so low that I honestly did believe that I was worthless. 

So no. I will not lower my standards of wanting a partner who has emotional awareness, emotional maturity, ambition for his future, cognizance of his past. I will not lower my standards of wanting someone who communicates healthily, who works through his trauma, who wants a partner to build a future with.

And if you tell me that I'm asking for too much, that no one will meet those expectations. Then so be it. Because I've already had the relationship with someone who doesn't genuinely know or love himself let alone know or love me. And I'd rather be alone.

Edit to add: I know that plenty of folks are saying that this is not what people mean by ""lower your standards"", we're talking requirements tied to looks. But unfortunately, in my experience I've met plenty of folks in the dating world who thought these ""basics"" were asking for too much. Hence my vent. I hope I'm wrong and maybe I just had a string of really bad dates. But based on some of the responses here I don't think I'm the only one out there being told that their basic requirements are ""too high"".

Second edit to explain my ex a bit more since this has come up a couple times:

I didn't pick a ""top 10% guy"". By the rules of the internet- he was not 6ft tall, he didn't have a 6 pack, and he was in a residency program so he didn't make that much money. 

I chose him because he made me laugh, he matched my energy, he enjoyed how weird I was, he had direction and ambition, and he seemed like a genuinely caring person. And if you ask his family and friends, they would still say that he is. But being in a relationship with him? At first he was great. But little by little he became controlling and selfish.  

For what it's worth i don't think he was an evil, unempathetic person. Just someone who behaved selfishly, put his partner last, and got comfortable with me putting in a majorityof the effort. You know, that classic ""now that i have you, i don't need to try"" sentiment. I didn't grow up with healthy relationship role models so I stayed much longer than a sane person would have, I had to learn the hard way I guess. 

But believe me, he didn't fit the online dating perfect guy physical model, he just seemed like he had a great personality in the beginning. After that it became a frog in boiling water situation.",dating
1004,He changed his mind after I deepthroated him,"



Hi all,

I am in a situationship with this guy. We have feelings, but a very different way of dealing with arguments/stress/frustrations. I like to talk things out. By doing this, he thinks I'm mad and he chooses to go silent. Problems don't get resolved this way obviously. This is also what holds us back from getting this deeper or to a real relationship.

Yesterday we had a good talk. He said he did think we should end this, because he didn't want me to get hurt. 

Well, we ended up having sex which he initiated. And I didn't know that I was able to do this, but I deepthroated him l. My gagreflex never really was ""sensitive"", but I didn't know I could go this far. I gave him my best blowjob ever and licked the life out of his balls.. and he went nuts. He fucked me >1h after that. 

Anyway, when we said goodbye he said that I needed to think about what I wanted. I said that his decision was clear, and I'm okay with it. He answered that he wasn't clear about his decision anymore.

I wanna know who TF is telling women we like chasing after you or that we will see you as desperate/clingy if you're the first one to reach out and text after a 1st date and etc.

At least from my own experience and that of my friends, chasing is not, I repeat NOT fun. I hate having to do it. It makes me feel like a loser or like some stupid chump. If I have to constantly re-initiate conversations, plan all the dates keep asking over and over when you're free etc. I'm gonna run outta steam and fucks really fast and/or assume you're not interested.

On the flip side, I f*cking love it when girls take the initiative to reach out, text back in a reasonable time frame and etc. I'm never going to think you're desperate/clingy if you reach out after the 1st date to tell me you had fun or look forward to a 2nd etc.

I'm like okay you do realize that one your lying and two that's not going to make someone like you. He genuinely thought I was just going to overlook this and keep talking to him. Guess what I didn't, He's unmatched and blocked. I honestly didn't find him physically attractive because of his size and the lying was the extra confirmation that I needed. Still annoyed I wasted my gas but whatever, taking another long break from online dating.

Update: all that open-mindess goes out the window when you lie and purposely deceive someone for your own benefit. It's also my right to have a preference on the men I date. I don't have to give every man a chance just because they want one. The entitlement on this post is insane.

And for the men saying ""well at least he got a date."" Yeah money out of his pocket gone. Didn't get a kiss. Nothing from me besides my time because I wasn't attracted to him. And never getting a second date. So you gain absolutely nothing and lose money lol.",dating
1014,girl at the gym asked for my number,"I was doing some bicep curls, when i felt someone taping on my shoulder, when i looked at the mirror i saw the cute girl that i had eye contact with her like 20 minutes ago, she literally asked for my number without saying anything else, she was like "" can i have your number"" , lol. I guess my reaction was perfect since i asked her which one she's interested in, my work number or my personal number, she asked for my personal number and gave me her phone to type it, then she asked for my name, guess what, i asked to do send me a text and ask me lol, and she did like 10 min after that.

1016,I’m officially retiring,"I (26M) am retiring from dating. I won’t tell you my entire life story but I just got ghosted (again) by a girl who GAVE ME HER NUMBER WITHOUT ME EVEN ASKING. We texted a few times back and forth the day she gave me it, decided on what day we were gonna go out and that’s that. I’ve probably been ghosted about 30 times in the last 4 years or so. I’m done wasting the emotional and mental energy trying to figure out why, it just isn’t worth it anymore. My last ex cheated on my multiple times when I was 22 and I haven’t been able to even land a date in the past 4 years while all of my friends are getting engaged and married.

1017,Just deleted all dating apps,"I'm not giving up on dating, I'm just sick of the toxic culture that online dating seems to perpetuate between all sexes and genders.

Then when you do match with someone legit, it's like talking to a brick wall. For fucks sake I've had better conversations with bots. I'm not saying these people aren't wonderful people looking for something good in their lives but the online dating scene is a sick puppy and doesn't really condone good conversation or getting to know each other. It's a meat grinder for both parties for different reasons.

Almost all my relationships have been found actually talking to someone, not texting or looking at a profile that doesn't allow barely any sort of information regarding the person. Instead it's quick one liners and tags. None of which really builds up to anything remotely needed to decide if I like the person or not.

It's toxic as fuck, and I'm over it. I'd rather wait it out and find someone I mesh well with doing something worth my time and not being detrimental to my opinion of other human beings.",dating
1018,Went to a guys place last night and I thought I was going to get murdered.,"I’ve met this guy once before and there was no real red flags. He invited me over so I agreed. He lived in a relatively nice part of town in richy condos. As I’m walking through the hallway I’m like omg, this seems like the last place ima see alive… I get in his apartment and he doesn’t turn any lights on and says his roommate is sleeping on the couch (who he told me earlier wasn’t even home) we get to his room and it’s… disgusting. There’s dishes with old food in them everywhere moldy beer bottles, old fast food, etc. I’m surprised it didn’t have a smell. On top of all that there was clothes everywhere. His bathroom was attached to his room and I took a glance in there and almost vomited. The toilet was so dirty it looked like it hasn’t been cleaned since 1976. 🤢 his sheets however were clean but he has “girly” pillows like throw pillows. On the floor was a pink womans sock. So I’m like, okay a woman has been here before. He starts counting money and lights up a joint. Then he offers to just lay in bed and listen to music I’m like okay, I didn’t wanna be rude and be like yeah I’m leaving. 

Fast forward an hour he gets up and snorts a line of coke. Told me he’s on probation for a OVI and takes some pills. Got back in bed and was cuddling and he started kissing me. I was so turned off at this point. He could barely keep his eyes open I was worried he was about to OD or something. He gets up and snorts 5 more lines of Coke and says “oh I’m sorry, did you want some?” Bruh. No. He proceeds to tell me he doesn’t have a problem and hands me a stack of 100s and asks me to count them. I’m like nah I’m good. He was just acting so weird and awkwardly aggressive sometimes. I’m like, yup I’m getting murdered. 

At this point I’m looking for an escape route so I tell him it’s super late and I think ima go home. He proceeds to do like 3 more lines of Coke and take more pills. He puts coke in his wallet and tells me he’s going to the casino. 

This was the second time I met this man.. wtf when I got home I looked at a public clerk of courts docket only to find out this guy has gotten 2 OVIs, a possession of coke charge, a domestic violence charge, and some speeding tickets and whatnot. I think I really dodged a bullet there.",dating

1024,Why do nicest people act so weird at times?,"I am home from college after freshman year and met a nice guy at my summer job. We were on our third date last Sunday and at dinner, when someone stopped stopped by and said hello. When I looked up it turned out to be Brad, a long time friend my older brother and family. 

Brad and I have a history. While I was growing up, he was very fond of me and I had a secret crush on him. Then after high school he and my brother both moved away to college on different coasts and I didn’t see Brad for few years. Then last summer he was back in town on business (he works at a west coast tech company now), I was thrilled to see him. To make the long story short, we hung out together a lot and I gave up my virginity to him. He took my sex education rather seriously. It was a memorable week I spent with him. 

This time, when I saw him I was pleasantly surprised, and but I expected him to just briefly exchange pleasantries and move on. Instead, he stood there talking seemingly to want to catch up. After several minutes, my date said to Brad, may he should pull up a chair and sit. I think he expected that will make Brad to move on. Instead, Brad did exactly as asked and sat down with us knowing I was on a date, and went in telling my date how he had known me all my life and how “close” we were and so in. Within minutes I began to see that my date sensed that there was much more between Brad and me. 

He politely said to Brad and me that, he’d rather us catch up with each other. With that he stood up and left after paying for the dinner before exiting. Needless to say I felt utterly humiliated I too walked out.",dating

I have been upfront that i suffer from an autoimmune illness from Long Covid and am now immunocompromised. Ive been double vaxxed. He is not. 
Its my first time dating since i became ill and i thought that doing a rapid test and showing him would demonstrate my honesty (aswell as disclosing my illness upfront). His respinse was ""but i keep myself healthy"" and then began to text how tired  he was, then fell asleep and then kept repeating if i really, really wanted him to do an at-home rapid test (here in Germany theyre every in supermarkets).

He has since sent me weird memes about having to rethink my life and ""one must reckon with things in life"". This feels like someone refusing to do sn STI check and insisting they are ""clean"" without even knowing and risking infection.

1026,What’s the most unfair “red flag” someone has said about you?,"Sorry for the weird grammar in the title lol.

But the most unfair one I get is “you’ve never been in a long term relationship”. I’m 27 and I didn’t start trying to date until I was 23 nor did I date for two years of the pandemic. I wanted to work on myself first. I have seriously dated 3 people lasting about 3 months each. 2 out of those 3 times, i find out the guy ends up not wanting a serious relationship (at the time, I wasn’t the most experienced at recognizing that early enough). 1 of those times we weren’t compatible and stayed friends.

Another I get is I’m too stubborn/too opinionated. I wouldn’t say that’s a red flag; it’s a personality trait you don’t like which is totally fine. Some people like chiller people so we’re not compatible, but it’s really not a red flag vs being like controlling.",dating

1030,Uncircumcised guy ruined date because of extreme phimosis.,"&#x200B;

Ok, hear me out. With all the recent talks about how boys shouldn't be circumcised at birth and everything, I feel like what happened during my date is relevant and I need to hear your opinions.

I met this guy on tinder a couple weeks ago, my bio clearly states that I'm looking for casual only, I have something on the lines of ""please drag me out to have a good time"". And I have a couple of suggestive pics showing cleavage.

So I match with this guy, empty bio as usual, but we start talking and I start flirting and sending hot pics to him and the guy is totally into it and we start sexting intensely and making plans for a hot date.

Then, after a week of full on sexting, we exchanged full nudes and I could see his dick, I noticed that he wasn't circumcised and that was fine by me, I have been with others that were not circumcised as well.

&#x200B;

We went to the beach together on the day of the date, then we went to his place, because he lived nearby, and we stepped in the shower together because it was a very hot day and we were sweating. But in the shower I started smelling something weird, and I thought it was just the usual odor from the sink at those houses that are at the coast.

&#x200B;

But when I tried to touch him to start some sexy time in the shower he pushed my hand away and kinda said that he didn't like it when girls touched his dick and stuff. But with all the things we have talked about I still offered to suck him a bit and knelt in front of him. And I swear, his dick was the source of the weird odor, it reeked of ammonia! I had never seen a dick that smelled so bad! I had to stand back and say something like, ""I think you need to wash, after being at the beach everything…""

&#x200B;

So when I said that, he kinda looked ashamed and told me to go back to the room, and that he would finish and go in a minute. Since I had already washed myself and I was perfectly clean, I left.

But at the bedroom, when he returned, I wanted to start the sexy time, and again I tried to go down on him, and his thighs and balls reeked of pee!! So, in preparation for this date, not only did he not wash his dick on the inside, he also forgot to wash his croth too? like, he did not wash his skin with soap??

He tried to get me to suck him and do all the nasty things we said we wanted to do during sexting, but I just couldn't, it's been weeks and I still have the smell in my nose! 

Yet, I was nice and I played it off and tried to jerk him instead but he again wouldn't let me touch his dick for that. The head of his dick wasn't even poking or anything, it was hard but rather small, and it was fully covered in skin. Like the orifice at the tip of the foreskin was so small that he probably couldn't even put a finger there to wash.

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to finish and leave by then and told him to put on a condom and to fuck instead, but when he tried to put on a condom his dick went completely limp. Like I was naked in his bed, looking my best, clean and shaved, I even put on perfume and lip gloss while I waited for him to finish showering, and this guy couldn't even keep his dick hard enough to put on a condom.

After the 3rd dried up condom he just gave up, and we laid there in bed, for a moment, where he apologized and literally said ""welcome to the club of disappointed girls""

&#x200B;

I was stunned, I was in fucking disbelief. This man, 25 years old, not only couldn't wash his dick properly, he couldn't even take a proper shower with soap to wash himself for a willing partner that had already told him that was ready to suck his uncircumcised dick! 

I'm sorry, and I'm not doctor, but if you have a phimosis so extreme that you don't want girls to touch your dick, that you can't wash your dick properly, and that you can't even put on a condom to fuck… shouldn't you be considering the surgery to get circumcised??

&#x200B;

This is not in the US, we have free socialized healthcare and this man's parents own 2 restaurants, he's not poor and the surgery would be free here for such extreme cases, like he clearly can't even have normal sex. I didn't say anything and just thanked him for the date when I left, but Jesus Christ, we ha been talking for a full week about just fucking and I had to go home to fuck myself.

&#x200B;

So, what do you guys think?? It's not my business and I won't tell this guy to go get the surgery unprompted, but if he asks about what went wrong that day, I fully intend to let him know that his dick smells of ammonia and to see a doctor. 

&#x200B;

For more context I'll say that I'm a woman. My profile and nude pics were taken a few days prior to the date and without filters, I was showing myself just as I am. But I have never seen such phimosis before, and I have no medical experience of any kind, I just wanted to suck some dick and get fucked.

&#x200B;

Edit: after reading many comments about people saying that he just doesn't know how to wash, sorry if I didn't explain well, but I'm under the impression this man is unable to pull the skin back, at all, to the point that he's scared of women touching his dick to try and pull back.

I will also say that I did not laugh or mock him in any way, I was compassionate and understanding, but I'm not his girlfriend and I do not owe him anything, really.",dating
1031,How do I salvage the fact that I can’t fuck my girlfriend like her ex did?,"Not going to bore all of you with stuff about how we met so I’m just going to get into it cause it honestly makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. 

Long story short, me and my girlfriend were hanging out with some friends and we’re getting drunk and ended up playing truth or dare. And when she picked truth, someone asked her what her favorite sex position was. She answered with a position that as far as I know doesn’t have a specific name and described it in relatively vivid detail. This is a position we’ve never done so I was a bit upset that she never wanted to try it with me and i was definitely hurt but I ignored it for the sake of the night. Once we got home I asked her about it and she said that the position leaves a fair amount of the dick out, and that because mine was smaller, she wouldn’t be able to move on it properly and she would only really be trying to maneuver on the head of penis, whereas her ex was much bigger so he was still able to fill her up and hit the right spots even in that position. 

This obviously destroyed me and that must’ve been obvious on my face cause she immediately tried to console me. She-said that sex with me is still great and that it’s ok we can’t do everything together she did with him, and that there were still other things we could try. She said that she was happy with our sex life and my size was enough for her, just not for that position. When she woke up she apologized for telling me about it and mentioning something from A past lover with me there. She probably wouldn’t have but she was drunk and hadn’t had the forethought to consider how I would feel about it

I want to believe her, but I just can’t. Our relationship is great outside of this and I’m very attentive in bed. I give her head, do lots of foreplay and am largely focused on her pleasures because I enjoy it. However I’m not really able to shake the feeling that I’m actually inadequate and that she’s saying I’m good/big enough just because she likes the other things about our relationship and that secretly she wishes I was her ex. It’s not even like the ex was some douchebag, things didn’t work between them, but I know the guy and he’s a pretty decent dude. I don’t know what to do, the idea of having sex with her just feels almost revolting at this point and my insecurities are spiking. What can I do to try to move past this? Or is it a lost cause?

Edit: for All of you making jokes saying I’m immature and that size isn’t everything. I know, and it’s not the fact that he was bigger that’s the problem, but that he was BETTER. And I can’t hope to replicate it, because I wasn’t born with enough.

Edit 2: everyone saying, it doesn’t matter because now she’s with me and if she wanted him she’d still be with him is just wrong. The breakup was mutual, but initiated by him and even if she wanted him to stay he wouldn’t have. She understood why it had to happen but he was the one who was ready to move on first.",dating
1032,I walked away from a date because the girl said ''you're attractive despite being short'',"Long story short: I'm 30, I'm an Italian man and I'm 5'9. I moved to America a few years ago, I found a job here after University. I think Americans are friendly, cool people and the country undoubtedly has a lot of beautiful places, 

but the height obsession in this country is  simply absurd from the point of view of an outsider, and I do not want to date anyone any woman here anymore, I think I want to fly back to Europe and that's a shame because I actually like everything else in America, but not the dating game.

I went on a date with this girl, the date was going well and we were having fun, at some point though she said ''you're very attractive despite being a little short'', I walked away after she said that, immediately. She tried to apologize, but that was absolutely a deal breaker for me, then she tried to text me and apologize, she said ''you're good-looking and you have other qualities that are more important than your height'' and I was like ''no madam, I do not want to feel like I need other qualities to compensate for my lack of height, because my height isn't a flaw''

 The average man in Italy is 5'9 - 5'10, which means that even in my country I'm not considered tall (but 5'9 is average and totally acceptable in Italy), the main difference is that women and  most people just do not care about height.  

False modesty aside, I'm not ugly at all, and I lost the count of how many times in Italy I was the shortest guy in a room or at a party, yet I was the one being stared at or hit on,  but this isn't just Italian women, this is most southern Europeans,  I went on a dinner with a few Spanish and Southern American friends some time ago, I hadn't moved to America yet, there were taller guys at the table, but the girls were just paying attention to me and ignoring the other guys because they evidently thought I was the most attractive one despite not being the tallest.

&#x200B;

 I think that this heightism is just a cultural thing in the US/Canada and Southern European countries, but to me it's a very shallow metric to measure someone's attractiveness, I see a lot of dudes walking around with a perfect posture all the time because they want to show off their height and as an Italian I look at them and think ''dude what the heck relax, you're standing straight like a soldier'' 

I'm not looking for advice, things just are the way they are and I can't expect to change America's culture, I'm just venting, I'll move back to my country and this problem will be solved lol.

1036,Do you find modern dating traumatic?,"I do. 
Particularly in the last 10 years. I’m 27F. It’s pretty cutthroat and not for the faint of heart. 

Ghosting - painful asf but normalized. 

Hook up culture is normalized- barely anyone wants a committed relationship anymore. 

Picky/Quick to reject  - the plethora of people on  dating apps have allowed people to become extremely picky and almost unrealistic in some cases. Standards are good, keep them, but looking for “perfect” is looking for something that doesn’t exist. 

“Grass is greener” mentality- don’t want to commit because they are always afraid something “better” will come along. 
*the grass is greener where you water it* 😉

Jaded/skittish- everyone is so burnt by their past bc they don’t allow themselves to heal and become so skittish and fickle

Online s*xual harrassment- many men thinks it’s okay to send unsolicited, explicit, disrespectful messages to women. And bc it’s online- it for the most part goes unpunished.

No/Low effort- Many individuals think they should be hunted down and don’t feel the need to match your energy

Entitlement- many individuals think they are deserving of things they’re not. 
Men it’s “Because I bought you a $15 meal, you know owe me dat booty.” 
Women it’s “Because I’m pretty, you owe me free meals.”

Dating has *never* been easy but I don’t think our grandparents had to go through ALL of this buffoonery

EDIT: Don’t get too hung up on whether you think our grandparents had it better/worse. 
The question is in the title 😊

EDIT: Yes, traumatic is the word I am using. And here is
why.
Traumatic per dictionary - *in psychiatry*
psychologically painful or distressing

Trauma - an experience that produces psychological
injury or pain often with lasting emotional affects.

I believe trauma has a spectrum. 
Also, believe that what is not traumatic to one, may deeply traumatize the next. 

We all have different tolerances.
So to objectively argue that dating is not traumatic as
a factual is undermining those of us who have had
some truly awful experiences in dating, to the point
where some of us need therapy and a shoulder to cry
on when your (oops i mean their..) 50 minutes is up
lol
Now the question is do *you* find dating traumatic? If
you don't, then you don't so your answer would be
no, but don't be too objective about it.

1037,"If you can't do THIS, you're throwing away your dating life.","I see a lot of people posting silly comments around the lines of ""I was sexually attracted but I just didnt feel a spark"" or ""there just wasn't a connection""

If you can't even define what a ""spark"" is, you're throwing away your dating life.

I'm going to put this as kindly as I can without swearing at you people... you're all insane. You're crazy. Absolute lunatics.
You met the person on a dating app, you have no prior knowledge of their existence and you're both awkward. That's cool, that's fine... but dont expect the sky to open up and a magical connection to be bestowed upon you. 
Relationships take time and work in order to connect and understand the other person. This doesnt mean invest EVERYTHING into a random hinge match, but it does mean that you should invest more into your best matches.

1038,I'm not going to stop approaching women in real life.,"I've seen a lot of posts/comments in this sub and others admonishing men for approaching women in real life. ""We don't want to be approached. Just leave us alone."" If I see a woman I'm attracted to, I'll take two minutes to introduce myself and say what's up. If she's not interested, I'll take the quick rejection and move on. Not a big deal at all.

Yes, there's obviously a way to do it. I'm not flirting with someone at the grocery store or the gym. I'm trying to buy my shit and get my sweat in too. But I can't see any reason not to say hello to a gal at the bar, coffee shop, or some other social setting.  And for the record, I don't expect any woman to reciprocate my interest. All I'm doing is expressing mine.",dating
1039,Is dick size why this keeps happening?,"So I'm a relatively big, slightly muscular black guy. And I'll be dating these girls, and everything will be fine. They'll really, really like me. And then, suddenly, it takes a turn. And they break up or start picking at things that weren't a problem before.

I was seeing this pattern, and I was trying to figure out the common denominator...and I noticed that this always happens within 24-48 hours of when we get to the stage when they feel or see my dick.

I don't have a micropenis, but it's smaller than you might expect given stereotypes of my appearance. I'm a grower, and fully erect it's 5.5 long and 4.25 around. Not erect it's less than half of that, usually.  But it'll happen...we start getting handsy, start making out, things get hot and heavy...then they feel my dick. And they won't say anything in the moment, but after that...everything changes.

It's the same regardless. Say nothing and they'll say nothing, but the dynamics change. Warn them it's not big and they'll say they don't care, and be convincing when they do it...but still, the dynamics change afterwards then, too.

It goes this way about 90% of the time.

And I'm traditional, naturally. Like I'll be getting attached before that point. So it's tough when the dynamics suddenly begin to change within 24-48 hours of that moment, like clockwork.

Should I...prewarn these dates earlier somehow so I don't keep coming out scarred and we get it out the way earlier?

Edit: I guess my main question is -- is this a thing? Will most women disappointed by averagish dick size not say so because that would be politically incorrect, and instead look for another ""reason"" to break it off that's more politically correct?

Edit2: Wow, thanks for all the feedback. Much more than I was expecting. It is doing a lot for my confidence and reassuring me that this is probably something that, in most cases, I can do something about.

Half of the guys think it is a size thing, it looks like. Half of the guys think it's not. Most girls genuinely seem to think, to my surprise, that it has nothing to do with size, although some do. Main advice is that as long as I focus on pleasing her first and don't put up any other red flags, I should be OK. I just need to go out there with confidence. Sure some women will be disappointed, but if they like me for me I'll be fine with most women.

And I should look at other things -- hygiene, apartment condition, what she says is the issue and -- above all -- making her cum without being selfish about it.

There is no way I could have gotten this much honest feedback IRL, especially without facing severe stigma. This community is amazing; thank you.

Edit3: I am not shaming anyone for their preferences. I have my own politically incorrect preferences and stereotypes, so it'd be hypocritical. Just looking for honest answers.",dating
1040,You Do Owe People Basic Human Decency,"I’ve noticed a disappointing trend amongst people. I’ve even had someone I liked say it to me recently. It’s the idea that we “don’t owe each other anything”and therefore it’s not a big deal to be cruel or dishonest. 

I fully agree that you don’t owe anyone a relationship, or sex, or your time. But you do owe people basic human decency! This means you owe them honesty and respect. (Unless of course this person seriously wronged you but that’s a different conversation). The dating scene gets me down because it just seems like everyone is out for themselves, it’s all about what you can get from others not much thought into what you can do for them. Not much consideration into how your actions may negatively affect someone else. 

I think people get hurt and turn bitter. They decide since they’ve been hurt that somehow justifies them doing the same to someone else. But we’ve all been hurt, we’ve all been let down. That doesn’t excuse being unjustly cruel or cold to an innocent person. 

That’s all, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.",dating
1041,I feel so embarrassed and think I just killed the relationship? [NSFW],"This girl (24F) and I (27M) have been going on dates for about a month. Things have been proceeding well; there's been chemistry and good times throughout. 

Last weekend she came over and we ended up making out towards the end of the night. No sex or playing around or anything, just making out. She stayed the night and hung out with me until about noon or so the next day. It was really, really nice. I really felt like we connected on a much deeper emotional level and that we both had a wonderful time. We've been flirting and sending hearts back and forth pretty heavily since then. The feeling felt mutual.

Cut to today. I offered to make her dinner this evening and she accepted and came over. The food ended up pretty terrible honestly but we had a good laugh about it and things progressed regardless. Things seemed kinda off right away though because she kept checking her phone -- like **a lot.** I don't really pay much attention to stuff like that but it seemed kind of obsessive. 

We ate and moved to the couch where we talked for a bit. Before long we started making out and eventually it evolved into sex in my bedroom. She was wearing some lingerie under her clothes and confessed to changing into it before she came over, which tells me she intended to have sex or at least fool around.

Some context. This was the first time I'd been with someone in nearly two years and she knew that. We talked about it and she told me to not feel bad if I came quickly, which I did. I asked her if I could help her finish and she said ""maybe later"" and told me to be quiet and come cuddle but then she wouldn't cuddle? She kind of just pulled up the blanket and made no effort to move towards me.

After like two minutes of this she abruptly got out of bed and started getting dressed. She told me ""usually the guys are the ones who leave quickly, but I'm doing it"" or something like that which seemed really weird. She quickly moved through my apartment, gathering all of her things without really saying anything.

I kind of jokingly asked her ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" And she responded by telling me not to ask that question because the answer was never fun. She told me she had a good time and that she found me very attractive, then left. She was gone within like five minutes of us having sex. She is a busy person so I get not wanting to linger or whatever, but I was really hoping we'd be able to connect afterwards and she didn't seem to want any of it.

I dunno. I'm just very confused by the entire situation. I feel embarrassed for coming so quick and for not being able to help her finish. I feel like I disappointed her or did something wrong. Just needed to vent.

EDIT: Thanks for the support and feedback everyone. It's much appreciated. I have seen a few comments about getting her off first and I feel I should clarify the play-by-play a bit more. Before things got real hot and heavy, she told me she wasn't really into cunnilingus. She gave me head when we got going for a bit and I followed by fingering. My plan was to get her off first because I knew I wouldn't be able to last very long but she told me she wanted me inside her after only a minute or so of fingering. So I obliged and held on for as long as I could.

UPDATE: She ghosted me.",dating
1042,"GF wants to be choked until it leaves bruises on her. For me it's a deal breaker, any advice or opinions on this?","Hey

So I've been dating this girl for a couple weeks. Known her for a few months. Anyway recently the relationship got more physical. We had sex for the first few times. 

It was good, she wanted me to choke and slap her. I was somewhat okay with that since I know many woman love to be lightly choked. 

But this was different, she apparently wants to be choked so hard it leaves bruises on her neck. 

She even told me couple days later when we talked about these things that it's only good when it leaves bruises and that she wants to be hit really hard during sex. And I think I slapped and choked her to the comfortable limit for me. 


Idk like if she's really into these things and there's other incompatible things between us I just feel like it's a deal breaker. 

I've been thinking about this for last couple hours and trying to be open minded but still can't accept idea of hurting someone I care about. 

Any opinion or advice on how to handle this? 

I told her I'm not okay with that and she just said ooof.

UPDATE: 

If anyone runs into this here's an update. We talked, and I was very much set on breaking up because of incompatibility. But we actually found a middle ground and it seems like she really wants to make things work. Also it kinda seems like she doesn't have that much experience and the experience she has is with shitty partners. I'm slowly showing her how I can make her feel good without hurting her (although some spanking is very much okay haha) and she seems to be into it. Guess I'll just give it time and see how it develops. 

Also I'd love to thank everyone for answering and helping me out! You're all amazing. And to the macho super strong guys asking me to send her their way... you're funny haha.",dating

1052,Married (almost) 15 years after meeting wife in online dating. A few tips/life lessons for men and women on dating.,"For Women:


1.	Men don't get complimented, like at all, ever. You don't have to fawn over someone, but if you tell a guy, ""Nice Watch"" on a date you better damn believe that man is going to be wearing that watch at his funeral. I've had women compliment different parts of my body (non-sexually) and I'm pretty sure I remember every one of those compliments I've ever gotten.


2.	Men, especially young men are absolutely terrified that they might be mistaking the moves you are making on him as being innocent. It would be humiliating to us to think you were coming on to us when you were not. You need to be absolutely clear with a guy if you are coming on to him. You need to say, ""I'd really like it if we went out on a date sometime to get coffee or play mini-golf"". Many guys won't pick up on it unless you use the words ""on a date"".


3.	Point number 2 goes double for sexual interest. We can be our own worst enemies and completely miss things. Example, I took a girl to the Marine Corps ball before I met my wife. We had a great time, and on my way driving her back to her car she said I wished that night didn't have to end, she said it didn't have to and she kissed me passionately... so I took her to Waffle House because it was the middle of the night and no place else was open. Now, it may be obvious to you what she was saying but it was completely over my head because I couldn't imagine a girl that pretty being into me.


4.	I've had girls I dated be really shallow and not want to talk about themselves for fear of being embarrassed. Do you know what my wife did on our first date that no one else did (no, not that, get your head out of the gutter)... she talked about what she was passionate about and interested in. My wife was a huge book worm, a nerd, and a big Star Trek fan. Ladies, we don't care what your hobby is, if you are passionate about it that makes you interesting to us. I've now watched every episode of every Star Trek series with my wife (actually, 5 left of TOS plus the animated series and the latest Picard but you get the idea).


5.	Be confident in yourself and tell that guy you like that you like him clearly as shown above. When I left high school I had not 1, not 2, but 3 girls moving out of town for college confess to me that they really like me and would have dated me if I had asked. All thought they had made their feelings clear but these all came out of left field.


6.	There is no man, not one single man on this planet that wouldn't be pleasantly surprised if someone wonderful became a part of theirs.


7.	Despite what you might think from reading Reddit, not every man on a dating site is just looking for a hookup.

For Men:


1. I never successfully asked a girl out on a date in person. From middle school all the way up to age 21, every girl I asked out in person turned me down. It was not until I became everything that people say women are shallow about or complain about (tall, in shape, in uniform, money, stable career) that I had any luck, and then only with online dating. With the exception of being tall, every one of those things is something that you can change. Work on yourself to be a better prospective date for a potential mate. If you are only trying to get dates online, work on your in person skills. If you are only trying to date in person, try online. One is not necessarily better than the other, but more of an “all of the above approach”. You will see no getting dates in person advice from me because I failed completely at that.


2. Start with your standards low and work on your dating skills. I fumbled through so many dates before I figured out how not to be an ass. This is not saying sleep around with everyone. This is saying take someone out on a date to putt putt or bowling and practice your talking skills with the opposite sex whether or not you believe there is a potential long term relationship there. You will improve your “talking skills” over time.  


3. Talked to my wife about how she ended up going out on a date with me as opposed to the loads of other people in her inbox. She said that she got lots of messages like, “hy u, u look reaaally gud, do u thin u maight wanna drinnnk and stuff”? Those went straight to the trash. In other words, use basic grammar and be respectful. I always asked out girls to mini-golf and icecream. If it is a date an 8 year old would like, your date probably would to. How many people do you think are trying to buy her a drink?


4. Date locations should be in a safe neutral location. No picking up at house (unless they ask). Have safety in mind for her. What would be a safe meeting/date for an internet stranger? It didn’t click in my head that a few of the girls I’d talked to online that had turned me down were doing so out of self preservation until one my potential dates told me she wasn’t comfortable being picked up for a first date. I did much better afterwards. Safety first.


5. Women absolutely judge you by your pictures and what is in them. I’m confident I scared off many potential dates as most of my dating profile photos had me holding a gun (I was in the USMC) because I thought it looked cool. Helping my brother with his profile, he had much better luck when there was something different about him in his photos than everyone else. I have not been on a dating site in a decade, but I’m guessing most profile photos of guys are of a smiling guy in the woods well dressed trying to look cool. Do you think it would be easier for a woman to respond to that, or to the same guy on a beach holding a piglet? One has much easier potential openings. My brother’s success went up when he switched from the woods profile to the holding animal on beach profile.


6. If you really are trying to find a life partner and not just a hookup, listen. Listen to your date, then girlfriend and when you get further in the relationship pet her. I don’t know that all women like it, but my wife loves pets and will talk to me all day if I’m rubbing her feet. 

Finally, guys and gals. Good luck to you out there. This all may no longer be relevant and the dating landscape may have completely changed but I hope all of you find that special someone in your life. Good luck!",dating

1062,What do women taste like?,"I (29f) have been dating a man (34) with no sexual experience. I love giving blowjobs so it has been something I’ve loved doing every time we see each other and he has been loving it. 

Last week for the first time he went down on me (his first time going down on anyone) and after a minute he looked repulsed (it was after a shared shower). 
I asked him if everything is alright and if there is a smell, he said everything is fine and came up with excuses like “we have so much sexual things to explore, we can leave this for the future”.

I’ve given him multiple blowjobs and he was fine with receiving, but not with giving. After pressuring him for a week to tell me, he finally said that “it was just bitter and not what he was expecting”. I asked for a comparison and he said Brüssel sprouts 😭

I’ve never had a man say something like that before and all my previous partners have loved eating me out. I’m now self conscious and I’m scheduling a gynaecologist appointment. He said “he’s not used to it and it’s probably an acquired taste”, but I don’t feel like letting him go down on me again.

1063,He is not the person I thought he was and I feel so betrayed,"I (23F) was dating this guy for about 6 months. Admittedly, I caught feelings a bit too quickly and I always kind of knew that I liked him more than he did me. I had hoped that he would eventually open up to me.

About a month ago, he dumped me out of the blue and I was destroyed. I have been grieving the relationship the past weeks and made a fool of myself trying to get him back on a particularly bad night. I’ve since started to come to terms that he really wasn’t that special and I was just in a vulnerable place.

I was finally feeling like I was over him over the last few days, so I’ve been going through the process of throwing away anything of his/from him. I often let him borrow my laptop for his schoolwork while we were together, so I was going through and deleting anything of his on there. I stumbled across this folder with my name on it and I have been completely blindsided by what was in it.

There were videos/pictures in there of me giving him blowjobs and us having sex, and I literally had NO IDEA he had ever taken any of these. My FACE is completely visible in some of them. I still can’t believe it. Who the fuck does that? 

I’m just so mad. I wasted all this time being upset about not being with him anymore, only to find out what a piece of shit he really is. And now I have to worry about whether or not he has more fucking copies of all of it, and who knows what he could have possibly done with them at this point. I’ve never been more mortified.

1064,"""WhY Do AlL GuYs"" Just stop yourself right there, please","This sub has an annoying and slightly gross habit of making things out to be like the last thing someone experienced with a partner is a universal thing with the entire four billion people of that gender they dated.

Recently we've had such bangers such as (paraphrasing) Tell me there are guys out there who don't cheat, why is it hard for guys to say they're not interested instead of ghost, many on people not wanting to find a long term relationship, when many of us are on either isle.

For one, rates of cheating are much closer than you'd expect (had to remove recent survey links due to automod), which a reasonable person could have assumed would happen with empowerment + opportunity, this is a human constant regardless of race or gender or any other divider, but in both cases it's a significant minority, *most men and most women do not cheat* still. Many of my friends have been devastated by cheating, many men and women on here have been, it's not specifically gendered.

All of the rest is also things we both experience. I've been hurt by seeing someone for 7 months before and after having a chat about getting a bit more consistent and serious, was hard ghosted after she was enthusiastically saying yes in person. Shit sucks. It wasn't a guy lol, because both genders do that plenty.

Please leave the gender warring on the elementary school playground where it belongs, I'd like to believe a significant minority of people may be shit, but the majority are good, and even the worst stats on cheaters bear that out. Ghosting is just a problem of our times with modern dating apps, and almost all of this other stuff I've seen brought up as a gender specific thing I've either experienced myself from another partner or my friends have.

I don’t know if it’s because of my past with emotionally unavailable men or nonchalant men who didn’t bother to touch me unless it was for sex. It seems as if every guy i’ve talked to has never gave me a hug without trying to feel up on me or kiss me lovingly — instead of trying to do it just to turn me on. 

I know people are going to say “oh get a massage” or “rub your own arm” like that has not worked at all to make me feel better. it makes me so jealous and envious when i see other couples who are openly affectionate; i understand yes, my time would come but it can just be so hard. hugging stuffed animalsand using weighted blankets can only do so much for a girl lol. 

 i’ve been turned off by going on dating apps or replying to thirsty men replying to my instagram stories because i am not interested in men wanting to have one night stands with me or be friends with benefits because i want genuine emotions.

I of course love sex but I want raw emotion and love. I understand that I am still young and have all of my life to find someone who can give me affection but it can just be so hard.",dating
1066,Something that Everyone Needs to hear at some point,"I've heard the same story a lot here, ""I workout, I have a good job, my life is going well, but I can't get into a relationship. What am I doing wrong?"", and the answer might very well be nothing.

The thing that people don't think about, is that dating requires you to be lucky. You need to be at the right place at the right time to find someone who you like and who also likes you and both of you are single and want to be in a relationship together.

That's not a common thing for most people that happens everyday. The common advice people will give is one of two things, either work on yourself, or work on meeting new people. Neither of these things are bad advice. But what you have to realize whether you decide to work on yourself or work on meeting new people is that this isn't the way to get into a relationship, this is the way to increase the odds that you'll get into a relationship. What does that even mean? Well, I think an analogy is an order.

I like poker. Doesn't matter if you like or have ever played poker. But poker is a game of playing the odds. It's a game about putting yourself in the best position to make money. But it's also a game of playing the people who you're playing with. You have to understand your luck, and the people you play with. And while playing poker, if you play consistently, there's the well-understood notion that no matter how well you play the odds, there will be times, maybe even a string of times where you lose. Things go wrong, and when there's something on the line (money, pride, feelings, opportunities), that's going to hurt. 

No matter how well you play the game, in any facet of life where there's luck involved, whether it's getting a job, getting into college, or getting a date, if there's any variance in the outcomes (i.e. luck), then no matter how well you think you are, there is a chance you'll fall flat on your face. So, comes the saying, luck wins the day, skill wins the year.

You have to ride out your bad luck. If you truly are doing everything right. You're working on yourself, you're meeting new people, you're trying your best, then you don't need to worry. In the end of the day, finding someone who you're compatible with is luck. And all you can do is increase the odds. And if you're happy with your current state of dating, but you haven't found anyone, then don't blame yourself. 

Patience is key. Because no matter how lucky other people are, that's not your luck. You have to keep playing the game until you get lucky. Because luck wins the day, but the best win the year. 

Good luck to all of you.",dating
1067,Why does a guy want to have sex with a girl he just met without a condom?,Was talking to a guy for a bit and we were about to do the deed. He said he didn’t have a condom. I said I did.

1069,Trying to get back with my ex-girlfriend but she fucked so many guys over the break.,"My ex-girlfriend and I broke up couple weeks ago because she wanted to find her self and wasnt sure she loved me anymore. I was obviously hurt because she suggest we break up out of the blue. I tried to get her back but she insisted I give her space. 

Recently we have been hanging out as friends and she mentioned that she wanted to try with me again. Obviously I was interrested since I have been chasing her over the entire time she dumped me. However, I just learned that she fucked so many guys while we were broken up ( in less than a month). I couldnt believe it so I had to ask her but she refused to comment and said its the past and she was hurt and was trying to forget me ( she is the one that dumped me). It hurt me so much that I had to take some time to think about wether it is a good idea to get back with her. I cant make a decision because I am clouded with feelings and emotions for her but at the same time her new history bothers me. 

Would I be wrong to take her back? Can it backfire in the future?

[UPDATE]
Thanks alot for all the suportive ideas and suggestions in the comments. I blocked her and deleted all her contacts.  I am going to focus on my healing process. Thanks alot again from the bottom of my heart!",dating

1071,I adopted a disabled cat and my girlfriend doesn't like her,"For the record, I(30M) asked my gf(28F) a couple of days before adopting the cat. We aren't living together yet but we were planning to, soon. She said sure, it would be great. So this morning I went to the shelter to take a look and see who to bring home, and I found a three legged cat. She also has some scars from her time on the street. I asked the staff about her and they told me she is getting put down tomorrow if no one adopts her. No terminal/chronic illnesses, they just didn't have enough space. I quickly told them I want her and filled out the form, and took her home.

Now my gf is berating me for picking a 'damaged' cat and insisting I replace her, even though I told her that they will kill the cat if I take her back. Do I have any hope of persuading her to see past her appearance or should I just break up now? I'll break up with her if I have to but I'm not going to abandon kitty.

UPDATE : I will break up with her when she gets off work in an hour.

UPDATE : She and I sat down and we talked about it. She said that the cat isn't cute and told me she still thinks I should take her back and get an adorable one. I told her that she's the one who told me to go pick a cat. She admitted she was lazy and didn't want to look around and go through the adoption process. She said she didn't think I'd pick an ugly one. I asked her if she's really okay with them euthanising this cat when she's safe right now and she said yes, just get a kitten. I told her I can't take her back to get killed so we broke up.",dating

1073,I (35F) was just let down by a guy (35M) who said he had given up on dating. One my best friends (37M) said he gave up too. How common is that?,"Maybe I'm coming in after the war happened, but this is a new one to me.

  
I met said guy through a mutual acquaintance, we shared similar interests so I got his number and messaged him from time to time. We went to a convention together and also ate a few times together. Not official dates, just talking about stuff and life. I thought there was a good connection, and he's the discreet sort, so I went forward and asked him out ""officially"". He was dumfounded, which was fun at first. Then he shook his head. We talked a bit more about it, apparently he had never been asked out and never had a girlfriend before. And at this point, he was done trying. 

  
We still meet up every now and then, sometimes the topic comes up. I thought that if it doesn't click well with me, at least I hope he keeps an open mind for other people. He replied that he does click with me, but he thinks that ship has sailed for him.

  
I discussed that with some friends. Turns out, another dude I know is in a similar situation, no girlfriend, no sex ever. It's even weirder in his case, as he apparently had someone that was head over heels into him not too long ago, and she didn't mind his lack of experience. He himself said she was great and it gave him fuzzy feelings, but all the same he let her down gently. He told me someone was into him, at least once in his life, and that's victory enough for him.

  
It's still novel to me. So I'd like to know, have you had similar experiences in your social circles?",dating

""Well, I tried.. I'm sorry, stay safe:)))""  
Maybe that restraining order DOES sound really good.

&#x200B;

So, we dated for about a month, just broke up with her a few minutes ago, no reply yet.When we started dating, everything seemed nice, she likes the ""color"" black, never seen her wear anything else for a long time, but I thought nothing of it. About a week ago, I learned she used to cut herself a lot, and had bloody clothes.. Last time I was at her place, she was wearing them. That was the first ""okay, what the fuck?"" moment. Next thing: I was in the kitchen with her father cooking, then went into the living room where I found her sister, chatted her up for a bit (I've known her for years), and then went to find my gf in her completely dark room, cutting up plush bears, while chanting my name. That was the cue for me to get the fuck out of there. For the past week or so, I rarely replied to her, and she started catching on, so I broke the news to her. Now I'm waiting for a reply and thinking if I should watch my back on the streets or not.. For a little backstory: She has been deeply in love with me for the past 3 years to the point of obsession.. I didn't know about that until today. She used to take pictures of me in the streets both during daytime and at night.. That creeped me the f out..And the icing on the cake: She has followed me multiple times. I saw her each time, but thought nothing of it, it isn't a large city.Well, thank you for reading this little post about my batshit crazy ex. I can answer any questions you may have, but please, keep it civil.",dating
1075,My now ex-girlfriend ghosted me after she......,"Had too much to drink and pooped on herself. We went on a trip for a weekend getaway. She had way too much to drink while she was on the patio of our air bnb after a very long day of touring and sightseeing after I had went to sleep. She tried to make it to the bathroom and accidentally dropped some of the poop on the carpet. 

When she woke up, I am sure that she was pretty embarrassed and then became very vague and her attitude totally changed. She ultimately blocked me on her phone and left. It sucked because I totally gave her the benefit of the doubt and even cleaned up the mess when I woke up in the middle of the night. It sucks because really did like her a lot. Lol

1079,A woman is demanding that I tell her my height before we meet. Red flag?,"As a taller than average guy (6 ft 2) I've been lucky enough in my life to avoid the problems that arise by being a short guy. I've seen my shorter friends be brutally rejected by women for just being a few inches shy of 6ft tall.

With that being said, I suppose I've developed empathy for my friends over the years. And I don't like being treated like a meter stick. So I remember a while ago I removed my height from my dating profile.

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl for a few days now and we finally decided on a place to meet up. But now, a day before actually meeting up, she wants to know what my height is because ""she needs someone who's at least 5 ft 10 so she can wear heels).

Obviously I meet her requirement, but I'm feeling a little iffy about this situation now. This demand in particular makes me feel dehumanizing in some way. Like , would she really not gonna meet up just because I could potentially be under 5 ft 10? Like Damn, I would never force a girl to tell me her weight or bra size before meeting up. Seems sketch.

1081,"Is anyone tired of people whose entire personality is just ""alcohol""?","I'm in my mid-20s. I don't have anything against drinking. I drink occassionally and my friends drink, but my past 2 girlfriends were both really into drinking. One pushed me to drink and would get angry at me if I didn't. The last one specifically bordered on alcohol abuse, which then led into me being emotionally mistreated by her on multiple occasions. Tbh, it kind of left me gun-shy of girls that drink really heavily and who always seem to need a drink in their hand. Unfortunately, that seems to be a lot of people in my age group.

After my last relationship, I'm embracing more of the attitude of ""my future wife's mindset will influence our children more than how she looks"" and ""if I wouldn't want my future kid treating people a certain way, I shouldn't date someone who treats people that way.""

I guess at my core, I'm just tired of being in a generation where people treat each other like they're disposable and where hookup culture runs rampant.

Also, in case there's any confusion, I want to be clear. This is in no way an endorsement of, or anything to do with, red-pill content or anything like that. If you want to go out and drink and be rowdy, it's totally up to you. I'm just expressing frustration from my experiences.

1082,Ghosted after saying Big Bang theory is dumb.,"So the girl I recently started dating & thought I was hitting it off with pretty well seems to have ghosted me after I said The Big Bang Theory was stupid. 

I see this as a win, I don’t think I could have gotten a better story out of it than this. 😂


EDIT: wow this silly post got a lot more traction than I expected, and a lot of you seem out to disparage me. If you guys actually want context I’ve give you some, It’s not that deep. 

First of all I didn’t actually say it was stupid, or dumb, or imply anything about her intelligence or belittle her in any way. Second I doubt it’s the real reason and honestly calling it ghosting is a bit of a stretch in the first place. We had been -dating- as I said. We had met up, discussed interests, had a lot in common, had a rapport even. She liked some shows I didn’t care about,  she didn’t care for some of mine. It’s not a big deal to like different things. 
We had been talking less often over the course of a week, just drifting apart I guess, circumstances and all that. 
The last thing she said was she was tired of watching Big Bang theory even though she loved it and wanted to play on her computer more. I responded by saying I couldn’t stand the show, and computer sounds more fun anyway.  The end. 

I thought it would be funny to say that was the reason, because; my final point, that show is bad. 
It’s insensitive, misogynistic, offensive and most of all deeply unfunny. I do not like that show. If you like it in spite of these things then I’m going to take note of that.  
It’s not a dealbreaker in any way, people can like things. Even problematic things, if they can understand & separate it from its issues. A guilty pleasure, or what have you. 
Oh and the rest of the comments were jokes too, I thought that was clear. Last Thursdayism is silly. Shrimp being unacceptable? Silly. Apparently these are evidence if being an a** to some people. Anyway. 

Have a nice day 👍",dating
1083,I just started telling them no thanks,"I am 29 and single, about to turn 30. Lately, I’ve been going out with a lot of men who tell me they want to “chill and vibe” for a few weeks or months before they get into a relationship.

So much of my 20s were wasted on men like that. I went on a date with someone two nights ago who told me that he wasn’t looking to get into a serious relationship straightaway, just that he wanted to meet someone and go on adventures together to see if they were compatible, and that he enjoyed being single.

I enjoy being single too, but that’s because I get that time alone. I don’t want to waste it with someone who isn’t ready for a serious relationship anymore. 

So I told him immediately after the date that I didn’t want to see him again. He told me that he was shocked and that I should see him again. I said no thanks.

The end!

Edit: I don’t want an instant relationship. I am totally fine to get to know someone over a few weeks or months. But I’m not interested in spending my time with someone who enjoys being single while they decide if they’re ready for a relationship.

He brought that up, not me, which tells me he wants to have his cake and eat it too. Look, I know I’m tipping my prime, but I’m still really beautiful, and there are guys I go on dates with who offer to take me on trips to fun places (I do not ever go.) If I were going to waste my time “having fun” with someone, why wouldn’t I do it with these early 40s tech men? Why would I do it with a semi-broke early 30s engineer? I have to start putting myself and my needs first.

Edit edit: To be totally clear, I would not ever let someone take me on a trip. I am just saying that, if I were going to fuck around for a few months and sell what is left of my youth, I would not with this man. I’m not interested in money, I earn plenty of money, I’m interested in someone I can love for the rest of my life. I’d rather spend my free time working on my body and building my resources so that I can be an attractive partner for the one I am with.

1084,"My date showed up 30 mins late without a reason or apology, so I said ""this isn't going to work out"" and turned around and left.

She immediately replies saying she's going to be 12 minutes late without an apology or excuse.

She texted me saying ""dang, sorry I had trouble finding parking. Glad we find out earlier that we don't mesh well.""Did I do the right thing? I truly believe we have to value our time and ourselves, and by staying, it basically enables people to disrespect you.

Edit: It seems a lot of people are making assumptions about my character lol. Fair enough based on the limited info I provided. Here are my follow-up thoughts. What I mean by pulling teeth to plan a date was she kinda give off high maintenance vibes. I initially asked her out to drinks on a week night and she said she doesn't drink on weeknights but is free, so I said OK let's do ice cream instead and she said she already recently had ice cream etc.  
I really do value punctuality (independent of dating) and I actually am a pretty easy going person for the most part, but being late is my biggest pet peeve. Imagine showing up 30 minutes late to a job interview, let alone without a good explanation. How late is too late? I feel like 30 minutes is pretty forgiving. Should I have just texted her and left instead? I felt as though if I had stuck it out through the date it would've been a waste of time as the vibe was already off, and I certainly wasn't going to ask her on a second date.",dating

I [24 F] have rejected so many guys in the past because they were ""too short"". But to be completely honest, I feel like this was due to social pressure and just a toxic dating environment amongst the sorority I used to be involved in. 

Whenever I would talk about guys with any of my friends, one of the first questions they would always ask me is ""Is he hot? Is he tall? Let me see a picture of him!""

I always felt like these sorts of questions were just so shallow, but I played it off like it was nothing in order to fit in.

Anyways, I recently left my sorority and have started having healthier dating interactions with men. I am currently seeing a guy who is about 2 inches shorter than me! We are going on our 4th date tomorrow! I feel like this was the best decision I ever made. He makes me feel the way I want to feel, and I don't need to approval of any of my friends/family. Am I so quick to jump the gun and just assume that he's ""the one""?. Probably, that's why I'm not holding my breath. But what I can say is that out of all of the men that I've interacted with, the one I'm seeing currently has by far treated me the best. 

All I can say is that I'm so glad not to be caught up in petty things like a man's height anymore. Yes, I'm slightly more attracted to taller men, but so what? The more I get to know someone, the more attracted to them I become, and everything else seems so petty.

I was just so taken aback, I'm so used to girls always expecting me to pay the bills so I was so just so flattered and couldn't stop thanking her over and over lol. She's also really into cooking and was super easy to talk to asking me about my childhood, my thoughts on life etc. And I just told her she is so unbelievably cool and I've never met someone where's there been such an instant connection with.

We went back to her place and she hugged me goodbye and told me she would like to see me again, I don't want to get my hopes up as she could just be saying that just to be nice.

1095,Did I overreact when he asked for nudes?,"TLDR: I texted a guy for a few days. He asked for nudes. I told him I am no longer interested in him. He told me to rethink my actions and be more levelheaded next time because I’m overreacting and it’s a red flag

I (24f) am looking for a serious relationship, hopefully one that’ll lead to marriage in a couple years. Lately, I’ve been getting a TON of guys asking for nudes within a day or two of texting them. I usually just block them. I also just block people if they say something rude, especially when they neg me or try to make me jealous lmao. When I was younger, I used to just call them out, they’d apologize, and we’d keep talking for awhile until they said something rude again and then I’d stop talking to them. These days, I just don’t have the patience to put up with it so I immediately block. I admit I may be too quick to do it

Anyway, I had been texting a guy for 3 days. I wasn’t that attracted to him but sometimes attraction grows so I decided to give it a shot. And he ended up being really fun to talk to! But I was busy all day today so didn’t text at all until 11pm. His second text message to me today was immediately jokingly asking for nudes. I should’ve just blocked him but for some reason I didn’t, and instead I told him I was super turned off by that and good luck to him in his search

At first he was understanding and we parted ways, then 20 minutes later he texted me again. Here’s how the convo went:

Him: *Also, before I sleep, just wanted to apologize if I came on too strong. I didn’t intend to make you feel comfortable and honestly was joking around, because I thought that was our vibe, but am sorry regardless. You seem like a sweet girl and deserve the best. In the future please don’t get so quick to anger without communicating, it’s a red flag and you might weed out guys with genuinely good intentions. Best wishes and take care*

Me: *Maybe you don’t get it bc you’re a guy and don’t have to deal with this, but I’ve already had 2 guys ask me for nudes just today. It gets old real fast. And the fact that you’re saying IM the red flag here is lowkey insane. I’m allowed to stop talking to anyone for any reason, and you asking for nudes is a pretty valid one. Maybe instead of telling girls they’re the one with a red flag, you could’ve just apologized genuinely*

Him: *I did genuinely apologize. I am also sorry on behalf of other jerks for treating you like that; you’re much more than just a body. Please reflect when you’re cooler headed. I feel that you’re projecting frustrations from others onto me. Guys get nudes for XYZ reasons because we’re tasked with playfully escalating. I’ve gotten plenty, and most girls do not react how you’re reacting. I do not want nudes from you (wouldn’t mind, but don’t want), because I care to know you better as a person. Kindly reflect on this later and consider a more tactful approach to communication in the future. You’re an excellent communicator already, and I know you’ll be even better with a more level head. Sweet dreams and take care*

To be honest, I don’t think he’s wrong to ask for nudes. But I was turned off by the fact that we didn’t even talk about our day at all before he asked me. And we had only been talking for a couple days. So it feels valid to me to not be interested anymore. But honestly I’ve been blocking a lot of guys lately for asking for nudes, so maybe I am the problem? Even though his text was polite, it just sounded condescending right? I don’t care about this guy in particular, but I’m trying to figure out if I’m being too harsh to guys in general",dating
1096,Gf gave random guy at the bar her number and agreed to hang out.,"I’m 29M and she’s 27F

exclusive for just about a year. 

I know you shouldn’t go looking for trouble but temptation got the better of me and I snooped her phone. 

She met a random guy at a bar like 2-3 weeks ago. She gave him her number and they chatted a bit the next two days. He asked her to hang out and she replied “ok 🥰 “

Obviously I got pissed at her and confronted her. She started crying and made the excuse “we never met up though, we didn’t do anything” 

Even if they didn’t physically meet up the intent was there though. I would’ve never known if I didn’t snoop so she’s also keeping secrets from me. 

It sucks, I really liked her and I feel like I wasted my time. She’s crying and asking to forgive her, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to. I still have feelings for her obviously. 

But I can’t get over it. 

What would y’all do?

UPDATE:

I told her I couldn’t trust her anymore and we broke up. 

I’m surprised by the comments however:
The majority of you said to end it, and a large portion of you said it was wrong of me to snoop as well which I understand.
But I’m really shocked by the few who said her cheating was my fault? 
I absolutely disagree.",dating
1097,Anyone else find it extremely dumb that having no dating experience by a certain age is a red flag?,"I feel like people often assume the worst if they found out it was the person they’re seeing’s first relationship or potential relationship.

I’ll give myself as an example. I’m a 22M, I didn’t really want to get into dating after I was done with college bc I didn’t want me or my SO to turn down a dream job to stay close to the other person. I had a “girlfriend” in middle school and went to a few school dances and hooked up with one of those dates when I was 17. Aside from that? Nothing.

People just hear “after college” and “no relationship” and just assume I’m some horrible person bc in their heads no one found me desirable. In reality I just wasn’t really looking, so if girls were showing me signs of interest I didn’t notice.

Not to mention we had a fucking pandemic from 2020 to basically now lol.

1100,"Stop telling people to ""lower their standards"".","More than often do I read comments on posts from people who struggling with dating that the need to ""lower their standards"" in order to be successful at dating. There's no such thing as lowering your standards! Attraction is not a choice, you can't just simply go: ""OK, I'll just feel attracted to this less attractive person then..."". Standards isn't even a thing, there are just people you find attractive and there are people that you don't.

What you can do is meet more people, improve at interacting with them and figure out that what you're looking for is actually what you find attractive in the opposite sex. 

What you're basically saying to people by telling them to lower their standards is telling them they're not good enough to find real love and they should just settle for someone they're not really attracted to.",dating
1101,Ghosted after sex….,"I (32F) Met a guy on bumble (42M). His profile said “relationship”. We had been texting for couple of weeks then finally met for a first date.

He was even hotter in person and I would say he is a 10, handsome tall successful. Im just a normal girl. Im immediately smitten. The next day he asked me to come over and we had sex. I’ve never had sex with anyone Im not in a relationship with and this is the fastest I gave it up. I told him this. But I really liked him so I didnt care. We continue texting and sexting. Im really into him now. The next week he asked me out again for dinner. Then we had sex the 2nd time. After, He said sorry, couldnt stay the night. Ok. I gave him a passionate long kiss. 

After this 2nd sexual encounter I never heard from him again. Literally his last text was the night we had sex. He used to initiate texting me everyday but now it’s been one week of radio silence. I am very hurt since I really like him. I was always in relationships and dont have much casual/sexual experience so  I really am taking this hard.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your responses. Writing here is helping me process my emotions. 

And to all saying I should text him first- I did text him first a couple days after to greet him for father’s day and he responded. But nobody has reached out after that day and Im not sure I should initiate again. Maybe he didnt ghost but he still lost interest.",dating
1102,Men Won’t Date Me,"I’m a chubby girl and haven’t dated since high school. Since I’ve been in college (four years) I’ve noticed guys only ever want to have sex with me and NEVER want to date me or have anything serious. 

I’ve had everything from talking to a guy on and off for over two years, casual sex, talking on the phone everyday for weeks, texting all day everyday. They talk big game about dating/potential relationship/dates .. then it always happens .. they just ghost me or stop responding. 

I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.. I’ve told some I’m just seeing where things go and others I’ve told I’m looking for something serious. I’m starting to think men just want to have sex with me but refuse to actually date or go out with me. 

Why do guys do this? Is it me? Am I doing something wrong?


Edit: Hi all! I just wanted to come on and thank everyone who commented with advice (whether you were nice or rude about it). I read every comment and it helped me realize A LOT.

My weight clearly seems to be a bigger issue than I originally thought. All the comments made me realize men’s image is more important to them than I realized. They also helped me realize that my weight could be stopping men from taking me serious enough for anything other than sex. That aside, I’m happy to say I’m currently working to lose weight (36lbs down)! However, I’m losing it for ME and not a man. Whether I’m skinny or fat, I want a man to love me for me not just bc I’m a certain size.

I also realized a lot of men aren’t really looking for relationships at the moment. Clearly the men I’m attracting/attracted to only want sex or a skinnier girl. However, I’m no longer going to be a “yes girl” as I learned I am in the comments. The dating scene is crazy rn whether you’re skinny or fat. So, I’m thinking that I might take a break from it all and focus on myself and improving my mental and physical health. 

Thanks again everyone!",dating

1105,I’ve been pretending to be married at work for the past year and I’ve built an entire fake husband,"Okay, hear me out. I’m a mid 20s single minority female working in tech for a large fortune 100 company. Although I’m a high performer with cred and skills to back it up - I was working with middle aged caucasian men that could care less about my words, opinions, or value……..until I wore a wedding band. 

It was like an instant switch. I read articles and research papers on how women with familys are treated better than single women in the workplace. I bought this big ass ring and started wearing it during face to faces in the office, conferences, and zoom meetings. I became seen, respected, and my words were no longer taken with a grain of salt. Now don’t get me wrong - I don’t put on a ring and am all of a sudden a highly respected individual at work. I put on the ring and I’m no longer a “damsel in distress without guidance of a man in my life.” There’s no longer the expectation of me to be a high performing individual, just an expectation for me to fulfill the goal and go home to family. I was getting congratulated for doing my everyday job well. Men stopped interrupting me when I was talking, started asking me my opinion if I was ever too quiet in a meeting, and were more open in sharing their personal lives. So naturally, I started to share some as well. Nothing huge, just like “I’m heading here with my family” or “we’re celebrating whatever holiday at this place.”

Then the fake husband emerged. He doesn’t even have a name, or an age, or a race? Just a profession. I work remotely and have been for 2 years. My director asks me to move ACROSS the country in 2 months to be hybrid. I’m on camera, I’m caught off guard, and I decide to respond with “I cannot relocate, my husband is in his last year of residency at the hospital.” I literally in that moment turned my $50 wedding ring from Amazon into a husband working as an ER doctor in his 3rd year of residency. So in 7 months, my fake husbands fake residency will end, and i will be in San Jose with make fake ring leaving the office at 5 to make my fake husband dinner. 

In a perfect world I’ll have a real husband by the time I show up to the office. In a realistic world I’ll be getting a fake divorce. As of right now, I decided to change my bumble profile to “looking for marriage.”

1107,"I met a girl on a plane when I was heading out for a 2 week solo vacation. Now four years later, she's my girlfriend and I've moved here for good.","Just wanted to share this story. Four years ago I was having a difficult time with work and living alone. Had not been in a serious relationship for months, friends had grown distant because of my work priorities and overall I'd just been spending my days away working and sleeping (literal version of feeling ""dead inside""). My ""vacations"" used to be to just go visit my parents for a week every summer and during holiday season.


On a whim I decided to spend 2 weeks of my saved up holidays. Manager knew what I was going through so he approved without asking too many questions. I then took a holiday to Glasgow, as I always wanted to take a long vacation to Scotland/Ireland solo myself, after I'd visited it during a U.K. trip with my parents years ago. Met a girl on the plane who was going to visit home on her university vacation, she was also heading to Glasgow and we talked for a long time until we boarded the flight.


On the first (longer) flight itself, she and I had different seats unfortunately, and we wanted to continue our interaction over the flight so we checked around our seats. On my side there was a couple sitting so that was a no go but near her seat was a solo passenger who was a bit resistant to switch. I managed to convince him by slipping a 100 to him while the flight attendant wasn't watching (my seat was actually a better seat too). And then we just spent the entire flight talking to each other or doing random stuff together (including watching a couple of movies she had on her). Though we sat separately for the shorter flight, I got her number.


I had a lot of solo fun in Scotland, but I met up with her 4 times in those 2 weeks. I returned to Canada, and when university season started she returned too. We had been talking all this time and started dating for the remainder of her program. Later, she decided Canada wasn't for her so she moved back to Scotland... dead set on not wanting to lose her, I ended up planning my own move to the U.K. and looking into opportunities. Fortunately, my employer had a few open posts in England and agreed to ship me over, even though it was costly as this was pre-Brexit (this was the only time my overemphasis on performance reviews at work and overtime paid off). I got a 5 year work visa and landed myself in Liverpool. It was a total of 7 months of long distance, while I was figuring out my move.


Since then, it's been jumping between Glasgow and Liverpool till covid happened. Once work became wfh, I moved in with her to Glasgow, and haven't moved out since. Still working wfh, and I couldn't have imagined I'd be this happy 4 years ago. Gonna start work on ILR soon as I'd have lived 5 years here in UK pretty soon.


Tl;dr: A 100 CAD and some workaholicness got me the love of my life. Also ages in this story are 28M and 27F currently (24M and 23F 4 years ago).

I want a guy to ask before he kisses me.

And there you have it folks, all went well and he did know, as many of you predicted! He also is not bothered by it at all, and we even cracked some jokes about how fun it’s going to be hanging out as a group.

1125,Please stop me from messaging a guy who's not that into me,"I need you guys to knock some sense into me. I was on a date with a colleague from work last weekend. We talked for hours, then made out. He texted me after he had a fun, we even made plans on the date to see each other again. I was super excited to see him again. Then he stopped talking to me, just hi how are you at work.  I texted him if he's free the next friday. He took two days to reply and then said he doesn't know because he's tired from work. I made other plans meanwhile and told him I'm not free anymore and we can go out the weekend after that. He just said we'll see and on friday he texted me he he's sad I couldn't make it. Very confused right now. Weekend is coming closer and he hasn't texted me yet. I'm getting strong urge to text him but I know I shouldn't since he's probably not that into me...

Please talk me out of it.",dating
1126,"4 hours first date, in the end she looked at me and said “I had fun” with the sweetest smile. I went to drop her to the station where we had one of the best make out sessions.

All the signs in the end were positive. I feel I did do some mistakes for example when she said she had fun, I cracked a weird joke saying “Thank God I didn’t bore you!”. I didn’t quite say anything in person when she asked “See you soon?” because I started walking away but I did text her later at night and next morning. 

We’re both 30 and I get it that we’re looking for the one. But rejecting people after the first date is truly brutal.

1131,former virgin feels betrayed idk,guy i’m seeing rn took my virginity and it was very very consensual. i rly like him. still dating him. just found out he slept with someone three weeks after. anddd we’ve slept together since. i wouldn’t have slept with him again if i knew tbh. and idk if i’m entitled to feel bad abt myself or the situation. maybe i just clung on to the idea of being sort of monogamously physical with him since he was my first and we’re still hanging out a lot? i’m new to this world and i’m not sure how to validate my emotions rn,dating

1133,Do I text him after the date?,"It’s been about 4 hours since our first date. I (29F) had an absolutely amazing time. It was honestly the best date I had ever been on in my life. He showed interest in me (at least I thought so) ie hugged me when he first saw me, payed for my meal, laughed, kept up the conversation, wasn’t on his phone at all, and even walked me to my car and it opened it for me. He told me to text him when I got home to make sure I was ok since I had a beer and felt a little loopy and told me to sit in the car til it wore off a little and even offered to drive me back but I insisted not to. But it’s been about 4 hours since the date and I haven’t gotten a text from him. Does this mean it didn’t go well for him? Do men always text first after the first date?

UPDATE: soo after much coercion (rightly so) from you guys, I texted him that night telling him thanks. He responded this morning saying the pleasure was all his and he had fun! Then I just sent a quick article to a reference we made over dinner to which he laughed and commented on and the texting exchange died down. I should mention he is in the navy and leaving in 4 days to go to another location for 2 months but will be back after. I checked his hinge profile and he actually just updated it to show the new location he’s going to. I know it’s irrational but I was still hurt nonetheless. I found him on Instagram and want to add him just so we stay in touch so he doesn’t forget me while he’s away but would that be too clingy? Especially since he’s kind of the one that let the conversation die down today and changed his location on hinge already.",dating
1134,Help! I stalked my GF and found out she’s cheating,"I (m33) just recently found out that my GF (f27) has been cheating on me.  Unfortunately, I found out by stalking her, and I don’t know how to tell her I know without saying that.  

Over the last few weeks, her behavior has changed.  She’s all of a sudden much more busy with work and school.  She’s cancelling dates because she’s too tired or not feeling well.  And her communication/texting isn’t what it used to be.  

The other night, she cancelled coming over to my place after work, citing that she’s just too tired and wants to go home to sleep.  I didn’t buy it for a second, but I said “ok babe, feel better, let’s hang out another time.”  I didn’t get a single response from her after that.  I know she gets off work at 7, so I parked my car at the adjacent office building from hers, and waited for her to leave.

When she left, I got behind her, and immediately noticed she wasn’t headed towards her home.  I follow her to a completely different part of town.  She parks down a neighborhood street, gets out, and walks into a house.

A quick lookup of the address reveals it’s the home of her ex boyfriend/former coworker.  

Anyways… I plan on breaking up with her and telling her I know she is cheating on me with him, but I don’t now how without revealing HOW I know.

EDIT - I truly would like to tell her.  I want to see her face.  I want to give her the opportunity to come clean.  To apologize.  I still love her… I’d like to see her response.  Our families have gotten to know each other, and we mutual friends.   It won’t be a clean break.",dating
1135,I was rejected because she said I didn't order confidently enough,"I went on a date with this woman. Seemed okay. I asked her out on a 2nd one and she said:

""Honestly you seemed to lack confidence when you were ordering. You said you had 'choice anxiety,' and then said you weren't quite sure you know what you wanted. Then you quickly decided anyway. A woman likes a confident man who can lead.""

I thanked her and then thought wtf. The 'choice anxiety' thing was me making a cheeky joke at all the options, and I truly didn't know what I wanted since I haven't been there in over a decade. But just decided on the basic combination.

Am I crazy or was she?",dating
1136,Am I wrong for feeling insulted that my GF keeps talking with a guy who is blatantly hitting on her despite knowing she has a BF,"My girlfriend has been texting with a guy for a while. He has hit on her, telling her she is beautiful, sent her shirtless pics, invited her out constantly, and even tried to kiss her.

She has never told him it was inappropriate but did tell him she has a boyfriend. Despite knowing this he has not stopped hitting on her and she has not stopped responding. She has not explicitly hit on him or sent pictures but has and wants to continue talking with the guy.

I think it is messed up. If I did the same, she would be furious.

1137,Why my gf text with other people often but she will not reply to me all day long or reply few word messages?,"We do have good and interesting conversations when we call or when we go on date.

She told me she is just bad at texting and at first i took her reason even when it sounds lame. But now i see her texting with friends all day long even sometimes in the middle of our date and conversation she start to text with friends which is disrepecting and frustrating to me. Why does this happen only with me ? Why does she says she is just horrible texter then she text even when we are on date often and reply to me with one word messages? Not even something bad has happened between us that could ruin something. Relanshionship is still kinda new we date for few monhts. She really tells me she loves me, she is happy to talk with me and she tell she misses me everytime we cant be together and think about me all day long but then she does this. I dont think she is honest when i ask her about it bcs she is always like iam very interested in you, i like when we talk so iam confused. I always match her energy after she do this and then she is hungry. She has also mental issues and attachment problem she always break up with me and comes back to me wihtout me doing something to obtain her. She just says she cant live without me .I feel like maybe thats why she takes me for granted. Maybe i should put end to this.",dating
1138,Do women realize how common the “I’m just too busy to date right now” excuse is?,"I’ve been talking with 5 or 6 girls over the past few months, and either shortly before or shortly after the first date they’ve all given me the “it’s not you it’s me, I’m just too busy to date anyone right now” line.  One proceeded to jump into a relationship with some guy she met at a club a few weeks later, and the other, who I gave an opening to be as brash and impolite as she wanted regarding what I did wrong, wouldn’t take it and didn’t have anything to say to me.  I really wish somebody would actually be honest with me and tell me what I’m doing wrong so I could either double down on what I’m doing or learn from it and adjust, but everyone would rather just rattle off a bunch of empty platitudes that I’ve already heard a million times.",dating
1139,Being a virgin has been the biggest cockblock of the century,"I suppose I’m looking for guidance on how to navigate this. I have been looking for a boyfriend for quite some time (22f), but for some reason or another I have a hard time with connecting to people in general, especially men. I have been trying to date for a few years and every man I have told my virginity status to has ghosted. I don’t consider myself religious and I’m not necessarily waiting until marriage. I have tried a variety of tactics that include telling them or not telling them but when the ball drops they never stick around. I am considered attractive so everyone around me is confused on how I’m still single and recently my family accused me of being a closeted lesbian.  Please tell me this is normal I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

Edit: I’m shocked at the reception this post has received, I will go through everyone’s comments when I get back from work. I greatly appreciate the time everyone has taken to help me out.

Edit: okay to answer some questions people have asked. 

1. Yes most of these men are from apps, my workplace is 98% women and although I do go outside most of my hobbies involve staying indoors like taxidermy and botany , dress making, baking etc I do like outdoor activities like kayaking and such but I am in the wilderness, unless I see Bigfoot I would see no men. I’m generally not approached by men but my friends say I look intimidating. I have recently moved to a smaller town (US) that is mostly white and traditional and I’m mixed Panamanian.Also I know I’m not ugly! My previous job was a bottle girl. I was propositioned a lot there but only by sleazy gross guys. 

2. As far as having a strange personality, maybe. I was not diagnosed autistic but I may have markers. I am very good with making female friends, I don’t have any guy friends at the moment but when I did they all just simply wanted to sleep with me before actually being a “friend”. I think the only reason they kept me around was the opportunity to sleep with me so it felt very predatory to me. As of now I have no guy friends. 

3. For some reason people think I’m against masturbating, I’m not.  I don’t think I’m frigid or sexually stifled in any way. 

4. I’m looking for a bf not a hookup but if I like the guy and things don’t work out it’s not a bd. My first rule is I actually have to like them. why would I sleep with someone I don’t like or is a stranger to me? As far as dating out culturally I’m apprehensive about, due to some misogynistic cultures.

5. For now I’ll take the advice to just wait and stops using dating apps. I’m not around much men in my day to day life so I’m not sure how I will actually meet them. Also to not bring the virginity thing up until we’re absolutely close.",dating
1140,I can’t have penetrative sex and it makes me feel really insecure,"I’m a 21 year old woman who is a virgin and can’t seem to have penetrative sex, despite how much I want to have it. My boyfriend of almost two months and I tried having penetrative sex, but every time we would try, he could only get past the tip of his penis before I would start sobbing and tell him to stop because it hurt so bad. We tried lube as well but that didn’t work either. He recently broke up with me, and while he never said that was one of the reasons why he wanted to break up with me, I can’t help but feel like it that may have been a reason why he didn’t want to be with me anymore. And I’m worried that I’ll never be able to have it and that worry is making me feel really insecure ngl",dating
1141,"How to handle not wanting to go on a second date? Ghost, lie, or full honesty?","I (27f) went on a first date with this guy (31M) a couple of weeks ago. The date was going *fairly* well (\*maybe\* some issues with differing politics but otherwise checking all the boxes), we kissed, and he walked me back to my place. We had been drinking and he asked if he could use the restroom before heading home. I said that was fine. He comes out of the bathroom and leaves. Later that night, I realize that he has left the toilet seat open, the sink dripping, water splashed kind of everywhere, and the towels all rumpled.

I know these are small things but this is also a FIRST date and this is his BEST behavior. I kind of don't want to see him again. If this is how he leaves my bathroom after 2 minutes, how is he going to leave my life after three months?? So, the first question: am I overreacting?

The second question: he has texted, following up for a second date, and - assuming I am right to not go on a date with him again - I am not sure how to say I don't want to see him again. Ghost? Lie? Give some kind of generic ""didn't feel a spark,"" or ""things are crazy at work"" kind of thing? Full honesty, I didn't love that you left my bathroom in shambles??

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the input everyone! I hope others find this helpful too. A few updates/thoughts:

* Here is what I sent: ""Hey! I had a good time on our date but and thought a second date would be good to get to know you better. However, upon reflection, I felt like my space was a little disrespected after how you left my bathroom (seat up, tap still running)! This may seem super trivial and I know we were drinking, but it’s an important sign to me! As such, I don’t think I see this going further. Hopefully, I’m not overstepping - I thought some feedback could be helpful in your future pursuits. Thank you again for the drinks and I wish you the best of luck on your search!"" He replied ""Hey-- I'm really sorry and I understand where you're coming from. I'm really embarrassed for being inconsiderate! That being said, I don't think it was a good reflection of my character. I thought we had a great connection, so if you change your mind, let me know...I'd like to give you a proper apology! (Whether over the phone, coffee, or otherwise)."" So, in this case, honesty worked out.
* For those who thought I was overreacting/didn't really like him, please review the rest of these comments! There are clearly others who agree. It may not be how \*you\* see it, but have some humility! 
* Here is my impression of these comments: 
   * it seems that ghosting is generally disapproved of after an in-person date unless you feel there is some risk to your safety. I felt totally safe in this case so decided not to ghost. 
   * I feel like the ""full honesty"" where the problem is real and genuinely solvable is a nice way to ""pay it forward"" to the rest of the dating world. I went with this approach here and it worked out OK.
   * FWIW, my question about ghosting was based on a desire to do the least harm. It seems like \*generally\* ghosting is never the way to do that (though AGAIN, there are some comments here that endorse that approach even when safety is not a concern). I will endeavor never to ghost outside of a safety concern again!",dating
1142,Is it weird if I want to hit my boyfriend up for a booty call only?,"I (f25) and my boyfriend (m30) have been dating for almost 2 years now with both our schedules completely opposite of each other with maybe 3 hours in between of time where we could hang out. We do not live together so we only see each other on the weekends. I find myself during the week sexually frustrated and needing some release but I don’t want my boyfriend to think anything negative if I just want to meet up with him and have sex then leave to get ready for work. Would that be weird or is it weird to want that?


Edit: after seeing some of the responses I just wanted to say that normally yes a guy has no problem with having just sex but I have dated a couple very sensitive and yet toxic people who wouldn’t have been okay with this but I just wanted to get a general consensus because I have anxiety and previous experiences telling me other wise but also thanks to everyone who responded",dating
1143,Girl left her makeup in my car,"I’ve (21M) been dating casually for about a year now, I’m not looking for anything serious and the girls I see know that. I met this girl (20F) about 2 weeks ago and we went on two dates, but the second time I noticed she’d brought some makeup. We went out for food and she kept joking about leaving her stuff in my car so that if any other girls come into the car they’d know I was seeing someone? I didn’t find this joke funny because I knew she was serious. When she was getting out I asked her did she have her makeup (I knew she’d planted it somewhere in the car) she just giggled and said she couldn’t find it, I said very seriously that I didn’t want her to leave anything and to make sure she had all her stuff. I also think she wanted an excuse to see me again but because of this I was just really turned off. When i got home I found mascara in the passenger door and lipgloss under the mat. 

I told her a few days later I didn’t want to see her again. If this is a common thing girls do, please stop unless he’s your boyfriend..",dating
1144,I disagree with the saying that “no one needs a relationship”,"When people mention the word “need” the first thing that comes to mind is the need for survival. But the word “need” is not that one-dimensioned. To survive you only need food and water, sure, but survival is not the only need there is.

If all we need in our life is food and water, and have nothing but that, we’d be miserable.

There are emotional needs, human connection needs, romantic needs, and so on.

Romantic relationships *are* important for those who want them. And while no one is entitled to a romantic relationship from anyone, everyone is entitled to *want* to fulfill their romantic needs through having a romantic relationship.

It frustrates me to see people be so quick to attack someone simply for expressing the fact that being in a loving relationship is a life goal for them, and/or simply expressing that they feel upset that they couldn’t find or maintain a romantic relationship. Instantly hitting them with “you don’t need a man”, or “you don’t need a woman” “just love yourself” to invalidate their feelings and desires.

A relationship is not everyone’s life goal, nor is it what brings everyone happiness, sure, but *it is* many people’s life goal and *it is* what brings many people happiness and fulfillment. It especially fulfills their romantic needs because those obviously cannot be fulfilled in any other way.",dating
1145,Racist date,"Last night I had a second date with a girl I’d connected with through a dating app. 

I booked us a table at a nice high-end gastropub in an upmarket area. 

She had been out all day with her girlfriends and warned me in advance that she’d had a few drinks. 

When she turned up she wasn’t legless but it was obvious she wasn’t sober. 

We took our table and after studying the menu ordered our food along with a nice bottle of wine. 

As the evening progressed she got progressively louder but it was still all fun. 

And then she started saying derogatory comments about people of colour. 

What made things even more awkward was that all our waiters were black. 

It was clear that they had overheard her as they started acting surly towards us. 

I kept on berating her telling her that she couldn’t say things like that and that her comments were unacceptable, but if anything this only made things worse as she got louder and more vocal. 

Our food arrived and we ate it quickly after-which I got us the bill. 

This morning she text me to tell me that she’d been sick when she woke up. I didn’t reply but I had also thrown up in the morning. I suspect that the staff may have messed with our food in punishment for my dates loud and racist comments. 

Obviously I’m not going to see her again but I feel bad about her behaviour. 

Should I call the restaurant and apologise?

1148,Do you think it's a red flag if a man can't cook at all?,"Story that prompted the question: I went on a date with a 31 yo man and during the conversation I learned that he absolutely doesn't know how to cook almost anything. Apparently every now and then he has tried to cook something with chicken and usually causes salmonella poisoning because he undercooks it. He was surprised to learn about a meat thermometer from me. When I asked him what he *can* cook without causing food poisoning, he listed the following: omelets, cereal, ramen, and sandwiches. And just to clarify he meant just adding boiling water to prepared ramen noodles, not making ramen from scratch. I was flabbergasted. Like how do you make it to 3 decades of life without knowing how to actually cook at least a few tasty dishes? He then added that he went to the grocery store the other day and picked up zucchini by accident (he meant to get cucumbers). Like this man can't even identify basic vegetables lol. I was so so turned off.

1149,"Bumble, stop pretending that you care about your users","I saw today that Bumble is linking resources on their app pertaining to dating burnout and anxiety and it just made me laugh so hard.  All dating apps, yours included, thrive on the exploitation of desperate people seeking love, affection, and intimacy. The fact that people have anxiety from dating apps is what makes you money. Your algorithms are made in such a neat way that people will get anxiety and low selfesteem; that way people will spend more time on your app and are more willing to pay for useless premium services.

If you truly cared about your users then you would stop price gouging for premium services that do nothing, you would change your predatory algorithms so that more people got real matches, etc. Stop this virtue signaling masquerade, we all know what youre up to.",dating

We had an amazing first date, which lasted 6 hours and definite spark. We then arranged a 2nd date but she came to the date very cold and distant.

After the final date I called her out on it all and she said it didnt quite feel right, and how she needs instant chemistry and fireworks on a 1st date or it cant work.

1 day later she messages me and says she doesnt know whats going on in her head and that shes made a huge mistake and realises that she screwed everything up. 

Can anyone help me understand why she would do this and whats going through her mind?

EDIT - Wow, did not expect this thread to blow up. Thank you lovely people <3 I feel more relaxed about the situation now. I'm trying to communicate with her maturely to figure out what her problem is. If she cannot clarify the situation then I'll walk away for good. If she does explain and change her behaviour then I'll consider going for 1 more basic coffee date next month or something, as I've little to lose.

1151,Men of Reddit - how do you feel about dating a woman with no friends?,"I’m 27F. Haven’t had a single genuine friend in years. Recently this has started factoring into my dating life because the last two guys I dated are pretty social, which means they each had their own huge group of friends. 

But along the way I found them judging me for not having any friend - the last guy took that to be a lack of support system and put me through some horrible shit. Even his own friends would talk to me with a tinge of sympathy for not having any friend. The guy before him would complain about me not having any friends to go for girls night outs with, or even to hangout with. He took this to a lack of self confidence. 

So to the men of Reddit - what are your thoughts on this? Have you ever dated such women? Would you ever consider doing so? Let me know your thoughts.",dating

1153,For men: What are the biggest red flags you find in women's bios?,"Anything that is an instant indicator that you want nothing to do with this person, or is an instant turn off. I'll go first:

If they mention anything at all about their zodiac.

If they try to fetishize my height somewhere.

If their love languages are ""Gifts"" or ""Acts of Service"". Can't imagine being an adult and expecting or relying on other people to buy me things. Also, I am not your servant. Sounds like these women really just want a sugar daddy/maid, not a lover. Edit: Had someone try to argue that it's reasonable to value a deodorant that your partner bought you over celebrating your child's university graduation together. Crazy world we live in.

If they don't have a job and aren't in school.

If they make any kind of implication that they're a science denier or racist.

If they demonstrate any kind of entitlement. Ex: ""Entertain me."", ""Don't be boring.""

If they imply anywhere that they expect a guy to pay all of their living expenses, as if they're a baby and need someone else to take care of them.

If they have any kind of of demands/standards that they themselves don't meet. This also falls under entitlement. Ex: ""I only date guys with six figure salaries."" when they deliver DoorDash.

But she would just give something like shes not ready or shes trying to get her life together or something, and i couldnt blame her either way, at the end of the day it just means shes not interested, so much for me getting a second date for the first time",dating

1160,"why do guys constantly say ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" but continue to treat you like they want you and basically do relationship things","I don't know how many guys I've talked to in my life that tell me I am great, I'm everything they want, that they don't want me to leave, want to hang out every other day, FaceTime some evenings, go to dinners, etc. But they never fully commit. They keep saying ""I like you but I'm not ready for a relationship"" so I'm like why are you treating me like you want me then? If they knew they didn't want a relationship why start talking to me and get into something that you're never going to be ready to have. It just annoys me that people get close to you and openly say they like you and do whatever they can with you but don't ""want"" you. I get some people need to figure things out with their life for them to feel comfortable and ready to be with someone. I just don't get why they start something with someone before they're even ready. The highlight of it for me is when things do end they suddenly have a girlfriend weeks later or come back to me months later trying to suck up to me like they didn't mess around with my feelings.",dating

1162,Would you date someone if they told you they cheated in their last relationship?,"I’ve been talking to this girl and she’s been sweet and nothing short of an angel so far. Great humor, good sex, we enjoy each other’s company etc.. in short, things are great. 

The other day though we were messing around and playing the good ol’ “what’s worst thing you’ve done in a relationship” game. I guess we were just playing it for fun but then she opened up to me that in her last relationship which was a long one, she constantly cheated on her bf. This makes me very uneasy bc I like her very much but I can’t help but ask questions. I haven’t confronted her about it which honestly I don’t see why I should bc that’s in the past, but it just gives me such a weird feeling. I’ve been cheated on before and it took me years to build my confidence and move on from that situation. I’m I setting myself up for failure falling for a girl that is open about her cheating old habits?


Edit: so I conveniently left out the part where I moved away for school and we’re hours away and now everyone’s giving me solid advice, i thought I add that part. We’ve been talking/hAnging out for a year and seriously talking for 6 months.

Edit#2: Had the convo with her about it and she said I was overthinking and she’s past that phase. Can’t say it was very reassuring but I also didn’t want to push too hard to get more out of her",dating
1163,Guy didn’t answer my “confirmation text” until an hour before our dinner date. Was I right to cancel?,"I (31/F) supposed to have a first date at 7pm tonight with a guy (34/M) from a dating app. Two days ago was the last time we spoke when he first told me the time and location of our dinner reservation. At 12:00pm I texted him a warm message that included a “just confirming we’re still good for tonight.” When it got around to 5:30 I figured he was going to ghost me. I took my shower, got into my pajamas, and ordered a DoorDash dinner for myself. At exactly 6pm an hour before our date he texted “hey yeah we’re still good. Sorry for the late text.” While I could’ve scrambled together a look in forty minutes and made it time for our nice steak dinner, but on principle I didn’t. I instead told him politely that I had just made other dinner plans. I apologized for the miscommunication and told him I appreciated his apology. But I still felt terrible that I cancelled and worrying that I messed up here and should’ve been more patient/assumed it was still on. 

Did I do the right thing in cancelling? How should I have navigated this? Was I expecting too much from someone I never even met and had just made the plans two days prior so there’s nothing to confirm?

1164,My date last night was so bizarre.,"I 26F went on the most bizarre Hinge date last night and just needed to share. This guy asked me out for drinks after a few messages back and forth, and we met last night. The first weird sign was we planned for 7:30, and then one hour before changed it to 8:00 and a completely different place. Which was fine with me, but the way he just messaged me ""8:00, meet at X"" with no further explanation for changing it was odd. He then changed it to 8:15 the same way, and didn't show up until 8:30. He didn't even acknowledge that he was late once he arrived. I knew this was straight up weird but I was in a good mood and trying to stay positive. Once we get our drinks, after five minutes I'm not even four sips in, and he tells me how hot I look and asks if I want to have another drink at his place. I'm pretty uncomfortable at this point and say no, but I said I'd be happy to have another drink at the bar. His face drops and he says that he's really tired and is actually going to head out. The waitress comes by like a second later and he asks for the check.

I basically chugged my drink at that point and pulled out my Uber app. While we were waiting on the check he asked me again if I wanted to come over and I said no. The whole date lasted probably 20 minutes, and at the end he tried to kiss me and then messaged me his number afterwards?! Like it was one thing to see he was only interested in sex and ended it once he knew he wasn't getting that, but to have the audacity to think I'd see him again after that is wild to me? Am I just in the twilight zone or was that really bizarre?


Update: He just messaged me asking if I wanted to hang out tonight. Wow 🤦‍♀️ in response I unmatched",dating

1168,Date gave me mixed signals and wants nothing to do with me now,"I went on a date last night and everything went better then expected. To make a long story short, we started making out in my car and everything started to get sexual between us. so we headed back to her place and she immediately gets undressed in front of me while I did the same. We started to fool around a bit but she suddenly stops and tells me “I don’t have sex on the first date.” I was taken back by this but I immediately respected her boundaries and stopped pursuing sex from her. We only cuddle for the rest of the time I was there. It wasn’t until I had to leave she aggressively jumped on me and started to grind on my crotch. I jokingly told her “are you trying to give me blue balls?” and she seemed annoyed and irritated after I said that. So I kissed her goodbye and went back home. She was eager to see me again so we made plans for a second date. Once I got home she completely switched up on me for no reason. Telling me that she’s “on the fence about everything” and “sometimes it’s not meant to be” without any explanation. I politely asked if I did anything to make her feel uncomfortable and she left me on read. So I texted her again an hour later and asked if we could talk about what went wrong. She immediately responded with “fuck off, I’m not interested anymore.” I was heartbroken by this message especially after having an amazing first date with this woman. It was extremely rude of her to respond to me like that and could have easily told me what I did wrong and why she decided to not see me anymore. So I blocked her and left it alone. I just don’t understand what I did wrong to make her feel that way. I respected her boundaries when she changed her mind about having sex. I just don’t know anymore. Any suggestions and advice on this topic would be very helpful.

1172,Date asked me to Venmo him .. during the date,"Went on a third date with this guy last night. First date he paid, second date I paid, and last night we had dinner he asked what I preferred to do. I said I usually like to alternate paying and he said he likes to split. I said sure we can split. Even though that feels like we’re just hanging out as friends which he agreed to but said he thinks it’s the best way not to hurt anyone’s feelings. 

So I put down my card and he’s like I’ll just charge it and you can Venmo me. At this point I’m like uh ok sure thinking I’ll just Venmo him later when I get home or something. Right right he’s like where’s my Venmo you can just send me $20. 

So I did. That was the first time a guy asked me to split the check and Venmo him during the date. It definitely did not feel romantic at all.

Is this typical dating? 

I haven’t dated much and was kind of surprised. I was uncertain about the third date but gave it a chance and after this will probably not go on a 4th. Not just the paying part but I don’t think we’re very compatible with our lifestyle either.",dating
1173,Just had the best first date of my life with a girl I met on my flight,"I flew in to NYC Tuesday and I sat by a beautifully intriguing girl. She happened to be reading one of my favorite books, Four Agreements. We chatted a bit and I asked her out. Well tonight we went out and here I am left speechless. We clicked so smoothly, effortlessly. Talked for hours and I was actually interested(I usually get bored easily on dates)

She has some of the same passions as me as well. Unfortunately I leave to go back home tomorrow and I really fucking wish I didn’t. She brought up a second date tomorrow since I leave at night but I don’t know how to approach this. Usually I take things slow and build attraction over time.

All night I have felt HIGH energy levels that I haven’t felt in a while just because of our date. Very positive person she is, as am I and I think that’s why. Anyways should I just be playing this casually? Im just still in stock this even happened lol. Meeting a girl that sits next to you on a plan and really liking each other then uh… yeah you know the rest… anyways tips appreciated!

Edit: First of all thank you all for the encouragement + advice!!! I did not expect this post to see near as much engagement as it has.

Update: So we in fact did meet up for lunch before me heading to the airport for my flight (which I’m doing now while typing this lol). One of the first things that we conversed about was how amazing last night was. We definitely feel mutual about everything. She told me she enjoyed last night and found it refreshing as well. She even said “us” a few times while talking about our situation lol. We mutually agreed to continuing to talk and getting to know each other and see where things go. At one point I told her that we’re gonna fall in love if we keep talking and asked her how she felt about that. She looked at me, laughed really hard then said “I’m open to anything as long as there’s an emotional connection. I really like you.” 

I think the only down side to this situation is there’s zero chance my flight back home tonight tops my flight here. Hahaha. But in all seriousness, Im very thankful the uncommon occurred. If nothing else, this is a sign for my fellas to shoot their shot! You never know lol",dating
1174,I'd rather masturbate than have sex or a relationship. Am I alone?,"Title pretty much explains it all. I have a girlfriend or situationship or whatever you want to call it. She's a cool person, insanely smart and amazing in bed. We agree on lots of things and share interests. But if I'm being real I'd rather just be alone and masturbate when I get urges.  And before you say that it's just a bad relationship, I've had several long term relationships that always left me feeling the same way. Ive also dabbled with online dating like tinder and it might just be me but hookups are the worst. Way worse than sex with a partner so there's just no point.

1183,26M went out alone and got asked for my number :),"So like a lot of people in this sub I suffer from severe anxiety. I spent most of my early 20s shut in not going out, making friends, dating, or really doing anything other than working, exercising, video games, and sleeping. I lived in a small town in the south and had a rough break up with the first GF I’d had in over 6 years, we dated for 2.5 months and it got to “I love you” pretty quick. It was rough for me because it mostly went bad due to my inexperience and anxiety, I had no idea what I was doing. I was left in my small town in close proximity to my ex and had little options as far as dating.

The break up really made me want to improve my social skills. Things that soured the relationship were times we went to concerts together, I just had no clue what to do at them. My anxiety would make me just stand there and bob my head pretending I was enjoying myself. If a mosh pit started I’d get far away from it, while my ex would crowd surf and get crazy. We got separated for over 2 hours and I just stood around near the bathroom absolutely loathing the experience. But one thing she told me that night really stuck with me was when she said “oh you’re too nice to mosh” which isn’t something you want to hear from your girlfriend in my opinion. 

After the break up I had a realization that I was wasting the prime years of my life and decided to move to a big city (Seattle) to finally come out of my shell. Shortly after arriving I got tickets to go see an artist called Sueco and was going to go all by myself. Admittedly with the help of drugs (benzos) I was able to muster the courage to show up to the venue solo. I was standing there off to the side where not to many people stand and I was bobbing my head and enjoying the music. Suddenly the artist playing says “who here has been in a mosh pit before?” Me being a high idiot I raised my hand. The artist said “two words, prove it” and a pit started. Something came over me, I thought “I gotta get in there” and just pushed my way towards the pit and started going crazy. I had one of the best times of my life. 

After this I started going out by myself all the time. I always try to ask for girls numbers and have had success but have also been rejected an equal number of times. 

Tonight I went to a party alone called Emo Night where a DJ just plays classic emo hits and everyone dances and moshes to it. While at the venue I notice a cute blonde girl staring at me quite a bit inbetween songs. She was with a lot of friends and I was busy moshing so I didn’t approach her. However, later in the night she came up to me and complimented my shirt. I immediately knew she was shooting her shot and said let’s go some where more quite to talk for a minute. We chatted for a few minutes and had good chemistry in the short conversation we had. I gave her my phone to put her # in it and said I was going back to the pit and I’ll text her later or talk to her if I see her after. 

I texted her after I left and we have now made plans to see each other on Sunday 🙂 I hope to not use benzos as a crutch moving forward, but they are giving me the push to go out and do these things. It helps me realize what I am capable of and I plan to go out without them moving forward.

If you have anxiety and are scared of going out alone because you don’t have a lot of friends. Just go for it, you will meet people and find better potential dates than on dating sites. It’s not easy,  never thought I’d like going out. But it was just my anxiety and self doubt stopping me.

UPDATE: Wow didn’t expect this to get to 500 upvotes. Thanks for all the comments. She invited me out with some friends Saturday night, I had a blast hanging out with them and she said I fit in really well. We went on our 1 on 1 date the next night and realized we had very different goals and weren’t compatible for a long term relationship. Mainly that I want kids one day and she does not. She’s not open to a short term relationship because she says she knows she’ll get attached and eventually hurt when I find someone with similar goals. It was still an amazing weekend, and I was flattered to be told that I fit in well with the group. Normally in my life I’ve been the weird guy who doesn’t talk and everyone is wondering what my deal is. But since I’ve come out of my shell here I guess I’m a more enjoyable person to be around. It feels good. Overall this was a great experience for me.",dating

1185,My partner slept with over 100 women. But doesn't trust me for sleeping with under 10,"

What do you do when a partner triggers you on purpose to call you crazy?  He's done it twice and I was caught so off guard that I spiraled and blew his phone up. Now he's saying I have to abide by his rules and boundaries since I'm too crazy to be trusted.  But he purposely started fights about small things and then said I lied about how many men i slept with in the past out the blue. Then hangs up and ignores me until I'm begging to just agree with whatever he says just so he'll talk to me. 

I've never lied to him.  I've told him I've only been with 8 people (including him)  and everytime he's grilled me about the story I've never changed. But he's insanely insecure although he admits to sleeping with 100 women before me. He'll purposely ignore me or say weird stuff to trigger an emotional reaction from me. I told him this is gaslighting and abusive but he keeps saying I'm crazy so nothing he does is wrong even though I'm reacting towards how he treats me.  Am I literally losing it or am I being emotionally abused?",dating
1186,I tried asking someone out today and I got rejected. And it was GOOD,"Today I tried my luck with asking someone for their contact. It was a day of professional demonstrations and technological innovation. But I knew that the chance of me ever seeing these group of people are very low, I rarely represent my company in these expos. So with that in mind, I saw a cute girl.

And that’s it, I didn’t know much about her, but I was interested. So by the end of the day, I planned on asking for her personal contact with the disclosure that it was outside of professional reasons.

I hesitated once. So I went on to pack my stuff to stall. Then I hesitated twice. She was talking with people answering their questions about their technology and such. So I told my self, I am never going to see her again. If I don’t ask her, I would regret it. If I get refused, I get to know that it wouldn’t have worked anyways.

So I did. I simply said “hey, for outside of professional stuff, can I ask for your personal contact?”

And as you may have already read from the title she said “ah, I’m sorry, I can’t. It was nice meeting you though!” (And I said “oh it’s ok, it was so nice to meet you!”

Was I upset? Was I defeated?

No.

I get to live with that rejection knowing that i am capable of overcoming my shyness. I have a specific and healthy mindset when confronting rejections.

1187,"If a girl puts her mouth on your arm and bites you, is it a sign that she's interested?","I was at a friend's place the other night, and we were all doing artwork together.  This girl whom I've never met before came over, sat near me at the table.  We were talking for a while, and she was telling me about how her younger sister was misbehaving and that she had to bite her sister back to teach her not to bite others.  She asked if she could demonstrate it on me, so she took my arm in her hands, put her mouth on my forearm, and gently bit down on my forearm.  

To be completely honest, I got fairly aroused when she did it.  If she was trying to flirt with me, it definitely worked.  I then asked her to pull up facebook on her phone so she could friend request me.  She just gave me the phone, let me do it, and show me all of the memes she posted.

I feel like there are quite a few men on here wondering if they need to disclose ahead of time that they have a small penis, micro penis, etc..?🤷‍♀️ It's not cool that men feel they have to disclose this prior to going on a date.
I think many women can agree it's not really about size. Sounds cliche but it's what you do with it and the type of bond we have. I've been with men that are big but terrible in bed. I've been with men that are small/ average that are amazing in bed & a lot of that was a good sexual connection. Being passionate & attentive are two important qualities. A big penis will not make me like you more. If I am attracted to you then your size will not change those feelings. Just saying!",dating

1192,"Guys, be careful of who you choose to be your partner","I was coming to the backyard of my friends house to grab something I left from last weekend (he gave me permission). His wife was talking on the phone while sitting on the chair in the backyard. My friend wasn’t home. I slowed down my pace as her phone conversation got clearer and clearer and then I stopped and recorded it. This is a glimpse of what I heard, word for word:

“…If he dies like tomorrow like this is my house. Everything is mine…”

Know who actually loves you and who doesn’t.

I knew some people are this vicious and have snake-like nature, but witnessing it something completely different. I’m still in disbelief. Anyway, I’m showing my friend the recording here in a bit. 

Cheers.


Edit - oh man I didn’t notice all of the notifications. Some context I can give for people asking:

No, my friend isn’t sick or dying. Nobody is. And she wasn’t talking to a relative that is worried about the family. She was talking to her friend. Her phone was on speaker for about a third of the duration I was there. And I’m pretty sure her laughs could be heard from the 3 house away. So no it isn’t someone “concerned” or anything. It’s the snake Adam and Eve faced. I’ve seen crime shows, real dead bodies in real life, and many awful thing people do to each other and know what humans are capable of doing, I’ve largely became desensitized. But hearing this for the first time in real life is unlike hearing it on TV when some juge says “you’re not the father!” or something. Saying I’m in disbelief is an understatement. 

For now this is what I can say. I’ll update you about everything else with my friend. Thank you.",dating
1193,"Those over 30, do you ever feel like aging is the hardest part of dating? Specifically the physical aspect","As an (almost) 34 year old female, the hardest part of dating for me has been the physical. 

I used to be super confident and feel really beautiful. But with the recent collagen loss in my face and increasing jowls, I'm really struggling with what I see in the mirror everyday. It's made me not want to go on dates, not feel confident talking to men, and absolutely not want to be intimate.

1194,Gf [25F] and I [21M] created Bumble profiles for each other only to find out like limit and refill time are drastically different between us,"Originally posted on the Bumble subreddit, but it was quickly and silently removed by a mod without reason. Posting here for another shot at awareness.

My gf and I decided it would be fun to create profiles for each other and run them. The experience within the first 12 hours was the usual: my profile received three likes and one match while her profile received over 200 likes and 40 matches.

However, we discovered that my profile ran out of likes dramatically quicker than hers did. Additionally, her profile’s likes completely refilled around six hours later while my profile’s hadn’t refilled at all for over 24 hours. In other words, there is a clear difference between us in the number of likes allowed, and the time before profiles can be liked again.

I couldn’t find any threads on this, so if anyone else has noticed this can you please comment? Not sure if we’re crazy here or if this is yet another case of a dating app taking advantage of women to profit off men.

Edit: thanks for all the replies. We’ve already deactivated our accounts, this was a way to see what our tastes were since there’s enough trust. We discovered this on accident. Much of this post is already known, but I posted since I couldn’t find any info on the like allowance and refill time difference.",dating
1195,My FWB has fallen in love with me. What do I do??,"My [M25] FWB/friend with benefits [F23] has recently confessed that she is in love with me. She spoke in such a way that she could still have plausible deniability. 

In other words she didn't expressly say that it is me but that there is another guy that she met ""X number-of-months"" ago on ""X dating site"" and that they're just friends but she has fallen in love with him.. she descriped this other man to me and I am 99% sure it is me. Unless there's another man she met around the same time as me on the same website that also happens to have the same physical features and hobbies and interests as me..unlikely. 

Anyways..here comes my problem: 

1) I really don't want to hurt her. I have gotten to a point where I do care about her but in the platonic sense. 

2) I don't see myself dating her. 


How do I let her down gently? 

........................................


UPDATE: 
Hello everyone. Sorry that it has taken me so long to post an update. 
So I did speak to her, told her I would like to give her the opportunity to pursue this man she has feelings for without standing in the way so I think we should stop sleeping together for a little while. She agreed and we cut communication. I was relieved that it wasn't me. 

A week later she texted me to ask if I'm at home, I said yes and she asked if she could come past for a ""chat"" 
When she came over she pretty much immediately confessed that I am indeed the guy that she has ""fallen in love with""
Told me she thinks about me all the time. She's so crazy about me. She wants to be more than friends. 

As I've explained in the comments below, I sadly just don't see her that way...which I received a little bit of hate for but so be it. 
It started off as a mutually beneficial sexual relationship, I did not ""use"" her as some have suggested. 

I explained to her that I don't see her that way and that I wouldn't want to jeopardize our friendship. I also explained that I am not currently in a position to have a serious relationship in any case which is true. 
She shed a few tears, I tried to be as gentle as possible. We discussed it as much as we could but she eventually left my place in tears. 

I feel like a world class prick..and I wish it didn't have to be like this. I am also hesitant to try this FWB thing again. I've done it before and it went well and ended in good terms but this time round it bit me on the ass. It is always a slippery slope I think. 

She texted me recently and said that she just wants space to heal but she'd definitely like to continue being friends (minus the benefits) and leave everything that happened in the past.

Thank you to everyone who helped out with this. I would individually thank everyone but there are too many names to mention. 
I dobhowever want to give a special thank you to u/julia_gulia72 as her suggestion was the one I went with and in hindsight probably the best way I could've handled this situation. 

I hope that her and I will continue to be friends. I'm thinking I'll give her 3 months or so and then make contact again. 

I've also decided to make sure we don't spend any time alone but rather we go out with mutual friends. 

For anyone else that wishes to try this kind of relationship/agreement. Be careful, look out for warning signs that the other person may be developing feelings. If either of you do start catching feelings, cut it off as quickly as possible. Be warned that it may end in pain for one of you (although 90% of relationships do tbh) and also note that you may lose a friend. 

Thanks again everyone..peace out.",dating

1197,Do I (26F) tell him (26M) that I have sexual history with his friends?,"I (26F) have a second date tonight with a guy (26M). Our first date was last week, we went for drinks and then he walked me home and hugged me goodbye. For our second date I’m going to his to watch a movie, so one can imagine that more intimate activities may occur. 

The thing is, we’ve known each other since we were in our final year of high school. Long story short, some of my friends were friends with some of his friends so despite going to different high schools, we all did occasionally party together. Within that friend group, I hooked up with one guy (just making out and hand stuff, as you do) and actually lost my virginity to one of the other guys. This was all in our final year of high school. Both were one-time things and there was no emotional attachment or anything like that. I lost contact with all of them when we went off to different universities. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we match on a dating app. We both remember each other and decide to reconnect over a date. I wasn’t too worried about it, as all of that was almost 10 years ago but he mentioned that he’s still really good friends with both of these guys and sees them weekly. 50% of me assumes he already knows, as no one was trying to hide anything back then, but you know what happens when you assume…

Just curious if I should disclose this to him before we’re intimate? Don’t want to ruin the moment by being like “hey, I banged your friend!” but also would hate to be intimate and he somehow find out later and then feel like I was withholding information from him…

So what should I do?",dating

Shes 27 (F)

We  met on hinge and we had a date for today but something in me just  really does NOT want to go. We texted for the last 2 weeks and shes  AWFUL at conversation....one word answers, short replies, no sense of  humor at all. (she gorgeous tho)

I  figured maybe shes just a bad texter so we set a time where we just  talked on the phone instead and it was WORSE. We were on the phone for  like 10 minutes and it felt like i was talking with a potato the whole  time...shes a sweetheart and she mentioned she was excited for out date  today but im already exhausted from work and dealing with someone who  just is naturally quiet and introverted to the point where it feels like  i have to work to make a conversation happen...i just dont think thats  one more thing i want to have to deal with

I  canceled and said it was because i had to work late shift (i know it  was a lie but i didnt want to hurt her) she told me its fine and she was  disappointed bc she was looking forward to it all week but ...i just  dont have the mental energy to try to help someone out of their shell  and get them to talk to me",dating
1199,Who's wrong here?,"So I had a date planned with a woman a few days in advance and the day before the date I sent a confirmation message if the date is still on. A day goes by and still no response then 1 hour before our supposed scheduled date I sent a text:

""If you changed your mind, you could have just said that. Were adults here. Work on your communication skills and have a good one""

She responded that she thought the date was still on. Apparently she didn't get my text for confirmation a day before. Now she said because of how I reacted, she didn't think it was going to work out. I reacted how most people would react in this situation like how else was I supposed to react? I don't get why she has a problem with it since she didn't get the confirmation text anyway. (Maybe she was lying) It just tells me that she's not used to being called out or held accountable and doesn't want someone to hold her accountable for ghosting in the future. 
But was I wrong? Should I have reacted better? If so, how do I go about it because I figured my response was perfectly acceptable. I'm working on communicating better.

BTW, not calling them out is not an option for me. It makes me feel better to get it off my chest.",dating

It's very strange to me. It's also very possible that my lack of understanding of this attraction to me from these types of men comes from my own insecurities, but I just don't get it? I'm not complaining by ANY means, but every time it happens it's just so confusing to me. Can someone (especially if you are a ""someone"" that is that type of man) explain the lifting to loving fat women pipeline?

1201,I (28F) think dating will do more damage than loneliness currently does to me,"I was in a long term relationship (from 22 to 27) and he ended up abus!ng me, then decided to stay single, then half a year ago someone new came into my life and I gave him a chance, fell in love, and he left me after 4 months.

According to this new guy, I did too much for him, like cooking for him, offering to bring him food while sick, paying for my stuff, which is weird in his culture. He said I was too soft and that I should be more arrogant and play hard to get, and he criticized me for petty stuff like the fact that I have a minimalistically furnished apartment.

I talk to friends who date, both men and women, and I just don’t wanna do it. I can’t play games, I like making the first move (it seems like it’s a turnoff), I just want someone to love me for who I am. I don’t need to be arrogant to prove I’m worth it, a partner who wants me should like me for me.

These heartbreaks hurt me so much I spent months crying about them.

I need to know the person in order to feel attraction towards him, and I sometimes freak out when guys hit on me randomly. 

I’m just rambling. I hate being lonely. I want someone to be soft and kind and loving with. But I can’t do it, I can’t bring myself to try because it hurts too much.",dating
1202,Is it just my boyfriend or are all/most men obsessed with giving oral sex to their female partner?,"My boyfriend is the single biggest fan of my coochie. He's expressed earlier that he'd still be eating me in our 70s. Also told me I shoild be thankful we aren't living together yet, implying that he'd be eating me out every single day and that kinda freaked me out. Whenever we have sex, he's always so enthusiastic and aggressive even for that part. And when I tell him that I don't want him to go down on me, he gets a little sad about it. 

I'm pressured by the extreme affection he's offering from his mouth to my lady parts because it requires me to always be ready to orgasm... which is far from what I am. Don't get me wrong, I love it that my boyfriend gives my body all the love he can give. However, between the two of us, I'm the one who need breaks between rounds because I can't take continuous stimulation. In our sex life, I reach climax way less frequently not because my partner can't make me orgasm multiple times (he can, he does) but because I get soooo exhausted from just one lmao 

How should I approach this issue? Is my boyfriend too addicted in giving me oral sex, or is this very normal and I should level up my game?  Thanks in advance.


EDIT: I didn't realize how arrogant this sounded, and I also refused to believe beforehand that there's a lot of committed couples who's male counterparts rarely or never gives oral sex to their partners — but don't worry now guys, because I'm convinced that this is really the case. No, I was not humble bragging, I've come to reddit because I can't just tell this sensitive info to my female friends and especially not to any male other than my boyfriend. 

Yes, I've brought this problem up in communication with my boyfriend many times now. So far, his only explanation is that he's just so in love with my coochie and that he can't help it. We've agreed though that wouldn't proceed to give me oral sex if I say I don't want it, and he now understands that he can only expect one orgasm from me for each session. Thanks for the insight, just hoped you guys weren't gonna be this salty about it. 

TLDR: Bf loves eating me too much, I can't keep up. Turns out most men don't give/don't like giving oral sex to their female partners, thankful for the insight. Bf and I settled things, I'm a less pressured gf now. Yay.",dating
1203,Seeing my friend approach a woman changed my whole outlook on approaching women,"I’ve always been pretty shy and anxious, my social skills are pretty abysmal so approaching women in public was out of the question, I always felt like I’d look like a creep or they’d just laugh at me so I never bothered but what I saw yesterday changed my perspective on it

So me and my friend from college were out in the mall getting stuff for college and we walked past two really pretty girls who were shopping. I was like to my friend “damn they’re pretty cute aren’t they” and to my surprise he was like “yeah you’re right I’m gonna talk to em”, I was pretty surprised, he didn’t have to warm himself up or any of that he just went for it 

I was sure he was going to get rejected on the spot so I was nervous for him and then he hit her with the corniest pick up line I’ve ever heard in my life, I hid my face because of the second hand embarrassment and then something happened that I would never expect…she was laughing, pretty hard, her and her friend, I couldn’t believe that that worked. She even started asking *him* questions like what he was studying and shit like that, I was gobsmacked that it was that easy

He came back with a huge smile on his face (I was sitting down on a bench outside a shop) and he told me he got her socials. I asked him how he got the confidence to do that and how he was a bit nervous but if he didn’t go up to her he’d regret not knowing if she liked him back and that talking to people is easy when you’re not focused on rejection

I’ve tried to talk with her about this, as it’s never been a problem in her past relationships, and it seems like she really simply isn’t interested. I understand not being in the mood, but it’s starting to put a serious strain on our relationship. What should I do about this?

Edit: I appreciate all of the advice. I truly do love this girl with all of my heart, and I’m going to do everything in my power to communicate with her and fix the problems we’ve been having before I consider an extreme.

1208,Perfect guy was overly aggressive during our first time together and now I’m unsure about seeing him again,"Basically the title. I (24F) have been seeing him for a little over a month and I’ve been thinking to myself/telling friends we were the perfect match in every way. He’s funny, handsome, has similar interests to me, always made me feel safe (until now), etc.

After half a dozen dates, we finally ended the sexual tension. It started off incredible. Lots of chemistry—things were just clicking in a way that I’ve never experienced before. He brought me to a huge orgasm first, which was maybe the best I’ve ever had in my life, but then things took a turn when I was returning the favor.

After I had been going down on him for a few minutes, he started getting a bit rougher than I was comfortable with. Just pushing/pulling my head to make me go deeper, or like thrusting his hips into me. I get it, it feels good and he’s excited. Nothing I haven’t experienced before, but he is a bit on the larger side and I just needed time to acclimate first. I paused after that, asked him to keep his hands to himself in a somewhat playful manner. He seemed to get the message and apologized. I thought that would be it.

Well, a few more minutes go by and he starts getting handsy and pulling me by my hair again. It wasn’t as aggressive as the first time so I didn’t put a stop to it immediately. He was slowly upping the intensity from there, to the point that eventually I desperately needed to take a break to breath. I tried to physically pull away from him again, but this time he forcibly pushed me further down and held me there. It was probably 30+ seconds of me trying to signal to stop and feeling like I was suffocating, but he didn’t let me up again until after he had completely finished. It was so unexpected, and honestly just flat out humiliating.


He was extremely apologetic as soon as he saw my expression afterwards and obviously felt bad. He swears he lost himself in the moment from feeling good and too much alcohol (we had both been drinking) and just didn’t notice my discomfort. I think he is genuinely sorry, but I’m not sure if that’s enough. 

The only friend I’ve confided in with what happened is of the opinion that he and I are too good of a match to let one slip up end it, but I’m on the fence. Is it worth ending things over this one red flag, even if everything else is absolutely perfect?",dating

  Gotta say it gets frustrating to always hear about how “great” you supposedly are, or how women say “I just can’t find any nice guys” then they say that I’m too nice.  I’d almost prefer they just tell me they aren’t interested and not give a reason why.",dating

So I matched with this girl on tinder while on vacation in another state. She asks if I can Uber her to her nail appointment before I Uber her to me as I don't have a car atm. I accidentally put in a different places location as she was not specific to the branch. She says that it's more expensive at the branch she ended up going to and asked if I could pay as she wasn't expecting it. We've video called so I know she's real but I'm somewhat skeptical about it all. Not super skeptical but I haven't been dating in the US for a long time. Thoughts?

Update: I stopped being monkey brained before I would give her any money and blocked her. She wanna play like she in the streets then I'mma ditch her on the other side of town having to pay her way back and for the appointment which she was having as I blocked her. Back to the US and back to my toxic ways. Not even 2 weeks after leaving and I miss Korea, they were so respectful and had morals.

1213,Ghosted after dating her for a month and feeling pretty messed up over it all [NSFW],"Hi all! I posted about this situation in far lesser detail last week but I've learned some more info on situation and feel like doing something like a total post-mortem of the relationship. I've been thinking about all of it a lot and I feel like I might feel better if I can kind of just get it all out there, if that makes sense? I'll try and keep it to the point.

We met at a speed dating thing about a month ago. We hit it off and went on a follow up date a couple days later. It was coffee at a Starbucks. It went really well. She (24) told me (27) she had got out of a seven-year relationship like five months ago. I made her laugh to the point of crying and one of the baristas told us we were hella cute together as we were leaving and I found that super sweet.

Our second date was sushi. The place closed about an hour after we arrived and we were having a good time so we decided to head back to my place. We sat at my dining room table and just talked for hours. It was really, really nice. At one point my sister (who was staying at my place off-and-on) unexpectedly showed up. We all talked for a bit and before my sis left she asked my date if she would see her again, to which my date replied ""Oh, *definitely.*"" I figured she was probably just saying it because she was on the spot, but I found the way she said it to be very sweet. We hugged goodbye. I remember feeling so, so, sooo infatuated afterwards. Butterflies in my stomach, head in the clouds type shit. We texted enthusiastically throughout much of the following weekend.

The following Monday, however, I stopped hearing from her. I was a little worried but didn't want to come across as clingy or whatever so I let it be but we didn't communicate again until the following Thursday to confirm our plans over the weekend. It turned out she'd been sick all week and we decided to go ahead with our plans regardless. I got her some flowers, trimmed the stems, and put them in a vase to give her.

Our third date was interesting. She had just returned from visiting some very toxic family and she was still sick, so suffice to say she wasn't feeling too great. She almost cried when I gave her the flowers. We ended up eating street tacos before she had to take off. She told me she was going camping at this motorcycle racing event with a buddy (more info on that later). Before saying bye, I asked to kiss her and she told me she would love to if she hadn't been eating Mexican food. I was crestfallen, naturally, and took it as a sign that she had lost interest. That being said, I also understood that between being sick and rattled by her visit with her family and the Mexican food, it probably wasn't the best time to ask for a kiss. Regardless, we agreed on a pizza + movie night next weekend.

Again, very little communication between the dates over text. This only made me feel more sure that she had lost interest, though in retrospect I think that may just be how she communicates over text. I had no idea how incredible our fourth date would be.

We talked through the entire movie. We couldn't stop. It was very good conversation; lots of sparks and butterflies. She told me she had never met someone like me before, that she thought I was a very warm and kind person and that she liked me a lot. I felt the same. When I asked to kiss her this time she said yes. We made out for the next couple hours before cuddling on my bed. We both mutually agreed that we didn't want to have sex yet, though it was kind of implied that we would be having sex before long. She stayed the night. We woke up, had some more amazing conversation, and ate leftover pizza. She wore my sweatpants and shirt throughout, which I found super cute. She left around noon, kissing me goodbye as she went.

The texting became much more overtly romantic afterwards. Lots of heart emojis and so on. She invited me to play board games with her and her aunt at a later date. I wasn't sure where things were going, but I couldn't help but feel it was all going *somewhere,* you know?

Our fifth (and final) date was a week ago or so. I offered to make her dinner. I threw down the red tablecloth, lit some tea lights, covered the table in rose petals, put a vase of roses nearby, and put on some slow and sweet music. I was making a gluten free dinner for her because she struggled with gluten. I realized last minute that I'd included garlic bread in the meal (totally slipped my mind; not used to thinking about gluten) and when she arrived I discovered that the gluten free spaghetti was an absolute mess. I was so embarrassed. I offered to order pizza but she insisted that we eat the spaghetti because she thought it wasn't bad. I was really grateful to her for being so nice about the whole thing and we kind of just laughed it off. I should mention that she was also obsessively checking her phone and texting. I didn't think anything of it at the time but it struck me as noteworthy in retrospect.

We moved to my couch. I recall that she told me she felt very confident dealing with men and spent a lot of time with ""trash tier"" men but that she thought of me as a ""high quality man,"" which I'm sure made me blush. Eventually we started making out. I asked where her boundaries were that night and she told me she had none; I felt the same. So we went to my bedroom to have sex. Before doing so, I asked if there were any ""bad touch"" areas or things she didn't want me to do. She told me no one had ever asked her that before and it made me sad for her.

Some context. I hadn't been with someone for two years up until this point, which I had communicated to her well before hand. She told me not to stress if I came quickly, which went a long way towards making me feel less nervous. She told me she wasn't into cunnilingus and that she liked penetration. She then gave me head for a big before I started fingering her, which only lasted a bit before she told me to go inside her. She was very giggly, enthusiastic, and positive throughout the entire process. Until the end.

I came after maybe 3 - 6 minutes or so. I asked if I could finish her and she told me ""Maybe later."" She asked me to come cuddle. I layed down beside her and put my arm around her, to which she responded by pulling the blanket up to her chin and not moving. I asked her how it was she responded kind of harshly with ""Do you really want to do a play-by-play right now?"" I shut up and snuggled up to her since she wasn't moving towards me. I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I also felt terrible for not making her come. After like two minutes she got up, said something like ""Usually it's the men who leave quickly, but now I'm doing it."" She passed it off as a joke but it felt weird.

I was hella, hella, **hella** nervous and panicky at this point. She went about getting dressed and gathering her things. At some point I jokingly asked her, ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" To which she responded with ""You don't want to go there because that's never fun"" or something like that. Not my proudest (or smoothest) moment, I know. Before leaving, she told me ""I had fun. You're very attractive."" And left. I think she might have kissed me before leaving but I'm not sure. She was gone within five minutes of having sex.

The next day I texted her telling her I had a good time, would like to get together again soon, and that I hoped she had a good day. It's been about five days and she hasn't responded, which is atypical because she usually responds to texts to make plans very quickly (even if afterwards there's not much communication). I am assuming I've been ghosted.

I spent some time commiserating with some friends this weekend and they took it upon themselves to look her up on social media and learn about her. I asked them not to tell me anything they found, but one thing that was mentioned is that her ex (the seven-year ex) was into motorcycle racing. I immediately thought of that camping trip she mentioned weeks ago.

It all hurts like a mother fucker. I don't date around very much at all (and neither does she, from what she said) and it just stings so bad to be ghosted after sleeping with someone and seeing them for a month. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so sad that it ended like this. 

I've been thinking about sending her one last message at the end of the week letting her know that, while I don't know what went wrong, I enjoyed getting to know her and spending time with her and that I wish her well. Just to get closure for myself. I'm not interested in pursuing her. I haven't made up my mind on the text, though.

TLDR; Dated for a month, slept together, got ghosted the next day.",dating
1214,Can people stop using love bombing wrong?,"Love bombing is abuse. It is used by abusers at the start of a relationship but also after physical abuse, emotional abuse, after you break up with them or say you want to leave, or after you call them out on cheating or lying, etc. 

It is **not** someone being sweet and kind at the beginning of a relationship. It is not someone saying “I love you” too fast. It is not someone being very sweet and kind to you for a couple months and then dumping you with no other red flags. 

It is abuse. It is specific. I had an ex buy me a kitten after he beat me and he was so apologetic for weeks with big gifts and apologies etc which made me think it was a mistake and he really didn’t mean to hit me. The next time it happened he took me on a vacation. When I tried to leave he would buy me flowers and expensive jewelry and just shower me in compliments. That is love bombing. 

It is not someone pouring their heart out and doing nice things for you. That’s just a relationship in the honey moon phase. And if it ends because they dumped you that doesn’t mean it was fake. 

Love bombing is abuse. Stop using it to describe relationships that ended where someone was treating the other person well.",dating
1215,A lot of women will never be with a man that they want.,"Before I start I'll say that the minority of women who approach men they like are the exception. 

So basically you hear from women that they will never chase/pursue men and they will only filter from the guys that approach them and show some interest. And in turn they will not be with someone they truly want to be with if they don't put any effort into actively picking the guy they like.

Now guys on the other hand may very well get what they 'can' if you want to put it this way, however they are actually going for women they want to be with and shooting their shot.

Long story short.. why are women content with this? 

if you agree that is.. and if you don't why is that?


Edit:
Thank you guys for the replies its interesting read and I do try to see it from a women's pov which is why I asked in that way. It sucks for many but there are also success stories from women going for what they want which is great to hear. For the ones that doesn't work sorry to hear the losing interest/not being as invested seems common.",dating
1216,"I (26F) met a guy (26M) who is perfect for me on paper, but I’m not attracted to his body. Advice?","Okay, so I hate to even post this because I think personality matters way more, but I have to wonder if this is fair to either of us. We’ve been dating and talking to each other for a few weeks— we actually went away for the weekend. And we got intimate for the first time and I realized o have to force myself to want to touch him/look at him.

He’s obviously over the moon for me— already talks about our future and stuff— and I am over the moon for him and select physical features. It’s not that I’m entirely I’m unattracted to him, it’s more that I’m not attracted to him naked. He is very overweight— it’s clear it is affecting his health and that it’s been a life long issue. 

**NSFW**
We were becoming intimate and he wanted me to touch him. It was hard for me to find his dick because of his belly and pubic fat. And when I did find it, it was like my hand had to go inside his folds to do anything. Then he had me give him head, I consented but he was very rough and it was hard not to gag/throw up, then he came in my mouth without warning. When he stood up his dick was like consumed by the pubic fat and his belly folded over too. 
**NSFW**

I think that he’s working to lose the weight, though he hasn’t explicitly said so. I’m not skinny myself and I’m working on that— I don’t need a gym rat or a skinny man, I’m fine with some chubby but it’s beyond that. I feel horribly shallow for even posting it, but I don’t want either of us to get more emotionally involved if it’s doomed to fail.

He’s an amazing, sweet guy— we have so much in common and he makes me laugh so easily! I don’t want to get into a relationship with someone on the chance that they could change something about themselves. I feel like I should be happy with who they are now and not expect it to change. I’ve been the fixer gf before and I can’t/won’t do it again. Advice? Thoughts?

UPDATE: he decided to end things since I’m too liberal lol. And a lot of you were right— by perfect on paper I meant he didn’t make me miserable around him. Oh well.",dating

A guy who was very obviously romantically interested. I sat nearby for a couple minutes. I was pretty upset but tried my best to not be a dick. I eventually just walked to the other end of the bar and talked some other folks I know.. she eventually confronted me after spending the entire night playing pool and gambling with this dude.

And other co workers have even pointed out (maybe for the worse) we have like a husband and wife relationship. Anyway she is quitting soon and I wanted to take her out before she left and I told her this. But she wanted to go as friends. Which hurt. I’m just torn now between either telling her how I feel and saying something like “I would love to go on a date but not as friends” or just going and having a good time before she leaves… as friends.

1224,i love my boyfriend but i hate the way he sexualizes me,"i know that in theory this shouldn’t be an issue since we’ve been together going on 8 months and have had sex multiple times, and i know that he only says these things because he loves me and finds me attractive, but it just makes me super uncomfortable and self conscious. 

i have a larger chest, and some of the shirts i wear will inevitably end up being more revealing than i intended. i’ve expressed to him how insecure i am about it, and he claims to understand and to be supportive of me learning to like my body more, but his method of helping is to do things like whisper to me that my “tits look so good in that shirt” or we’ll be on facetime and he’ll be like “can you jiggle them around a bit?” or “can i just see some underboob before bed?”. 

we’re technically long distance since we’re on summer break from college and have different home states, but i’m incredibly against sending nudes and stuff like that so he’s been adamant on maintaining our ‘sex life’ in other ways. like he’s started asking if i want to sext before bed, and saying things like “i wish i was there so i can finger you to sleep” which makes my skin crawl. maybe it’s because i was SAed as a teenager by someone i thought i could trust, but stuff like the things he’s been doing and saying lately have made me less comfortable around him and constantly on edge. 

i can’t help but feel like something is wrong with me for not being okay with this, i mean i know i have a really low sex drive due to idk birth control or some other hormonal bs, but i feel like i’m the only person i’ve met who has this problem. my last relationship ended because of a similar problem, and i don’t know how to fix it.",dating

1227,"What's your ""hot take"" or unpopular opinion when it comes to dating?","I have a bunch after a few years of using apps:

1) I think most men are totally okay with waiting to have sex. If I meet a woman and I like her, I'm okay with waiting. But the problem is I feel pressured to make moves on dates or else I wake up to a ""I'm not feeling it"" text message.

2) Being ghosted and given a cliche rejection is the same thing. Both leave me confused to what the real reason she lost interest is.

3) I feel like online dating doesn't allow enough time for things to develop naturally. Every time I'm dating a woman from an app, I feel like there's this nasty shot clock with it. That I only have a small window of time to make something happen

4) Women do get a lot of matches and a lot of those matches are wholesome guys who are seeking a relationship. They're not gross all f-boys like the subreddits lead you to believe.

5) I think modern relationships have a very bad anxiety to it. The woman doesn't really feel that satisfied knowing she can create a bumble and maybe meet someone better, and the guy is nervous knowing he can be replaced.

6) You shouldn't go more than 2 dates without kissing. Nothing sucks worse than dating someone for a few weeks, then you guys finally peck, and she says ""eh didn't feel the spark."" It's good to just get it out of the way.

7) Sometimes people really do lose interest after sex. It's not like he/she was purposely misleading you, it's that with sex you see a whole different side of someone. The intimacy to the pillow talk. A lot of things in that process can make a person lose interest.

i've payed him back what he asked as he also stated he wants nothing to do with me anymore but i felt it was really uncalled for.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support! :D As many of you are curious about how many dates i went on and what happend that lead to the rejection here is some more background: 

We talked for some time trough an onlinedating app, where he really seemed super nice - hence why i went out on a date in the first place. We went on a total of 3 dates (1. walk in the park, 2. museum where i payed entry for myself, 3. to a cafe/restaurant where i payed for everything myself) the 3rd being the last, and he payed for 2 glasses of wine and one cup of tea. 

Im uncomfortable to be up and close with anyone i just met so i told him after the first date that i didnt want to get touchy feely right away (which he was kinda pusyh about but said he understood after i told him) and just take things slow, which he agreed to. Seccond date was great and i wanted to see him again, even if i still didnt feel him 100% cause ... you know: getting to know eachother. and on the 3rd date i was certain that we have different expectations of how we want to live our lives, different view of how to have a relationship and a womans/mans role in it... and thus told him exactly that and that i think its better for us to find someone who's a better fit.

I would not have minded splitting everthing from the beginning. The 15 bucks for those 3 drinks are not worth mentioning to me but clearly it seemed huge to him so if he has financial issues i thought it would be better for him to venmo it so he can stay on track with his budget 😅",dating

We spent the day exploring a small town, looking at art, talking, laughing, having deep conversations and he truly is the nicest, sweetest, kindest man I have ever met. He never took his eyes off me the entire time, sometimes it made me self conscious and he was so gentle.

In my late teens I even had a girlfriend). So, no, I'm not just gay. 

When I do find a man attractive I do generally find him VERY attractive, but me finding a man attractive is a rare occurance. I was just seeing a guy I met on tinder for a few weeks, but when he told me he was not looking for anything serious and essentially just wanted a FWB thing, I opted out of the situation. Now I feel gutted, because he was the first man I've truly felt attracted to for a long time. Man, he is absolutely gorgeous. And now I'm back at square one trying to find a man I'm actually attracted to, feeling slightly hopeless.

I have a slight problem with anxiety and I'm aware of that. But sometimes it's hard for me to determine whether I'm overreacting or I do have a reason to worry.

I met this girl on Tinder about a week ago. We had our first date (which we explicitly clarified, so I know for sure that it was, indeed, a date), which went pretty alright, and we decided to meet tomorrow. She's coming over to my place if nothing changes.

For now, she seems enthusiastic about it but doesn't text me that often. Usually, it takes about 11h to get her response. When she responds though, she expresses an active desire to meet and hang out and I don't have this feeling that she's writing me out of sheer politeness. So I kinda believe, that it's work and studies that prevent her from responding faster.

Today I decided to check her profile out of bad feeling, and there was a new photo and a slightly updated bio. Should I worry about that, or it's wrong to expect people to focus on one person after just one date?

I would also respond late to match his texting energy. 

However, the last straw was when he replied at 2 am. After that message, I did not reply. I left him on read. We didn’t talk at all for a whole day. On Thursday, he asked me if I am available for a phone call around 6 pm. I agreed, but he called me an hour later. 

He proceed to tell me that he forgot to call me because he went to the mall and got carried away shopping. Another thing he told me was that his friends canceled plans this weekend, and I guess he was wondering if I wasn’t doing anything. I told him I was busy the whole weekend. 

What bothers me is the fact that I’m not being a priority when I told him on our second date that I date to have a serious relationship.

After one of the hikes, we are settling down for the evening and I am scrambling and tripping over myself to beat my crush to the bathroom. I only needed a quick shower and knew she would take like 3 hours herself so it seemed fair to me. I did beat her to the shower and when I'm finished, walking out in just my cargo pants and towel round my neck, she is impatiently waiting her turn pretty much right next to the door. 

So I jokingly ask her: ""Do you bite?""
She says ""No?!""
""So why didn't you come to share the shower with me?"" And I quickly walk to my room, leaving death and destruction behind. (This was all pure jokes, as I wasn't aware she had a big thing for me as well so I'm just like ""Haha, such a funny guy I am /s *self-five*)

She was apparently left completely in shock from this and her friend who was across the room, and knew of her feelings towards me, almost had her eyeballs fall out of their sockets lmao.

1246,"Stop having ""backup"" crushes","I hear stuff about people having ""backup"" crushes in case their main interest doesn't work out and it drives me nuts. People these days completely miss the point of dating and liking people, you're supposed to dedicate your heart to one person and one person only, and if it doesn't work out THEN you find someone else. You do not have a whole ass list of other people you find attractive to fall back on in case your first relationship doesn't work out, it's morally insane and I just can't wrap my head around it. There's no actual feelings involved it's all just based on physical attraction and I hate that, people these days focus too much on physical connections in relationships rather than emotional ones and it's honestly sad.",dating
1247,Unpopular advice: girls should pursue and reach out to guys they like without giving it double thought,"I liked a guy off of a dating app. From the get go, he was perfect in every sense. And was so sincere and was looking for something serious (which is anyway rare on a dating app). I took my time to reach out to him when I was in his city. He was still keen to meet and pushed me for it and I tried delaying it. And despite me finally agreeing to meet the same day, he somehow got some urgent work and had to cancel, but he still said he’d give me a call if he got the time. Not only that, I never reached out and neither did he. I then reached out after a month or so. And he said he had already just met another girl last month and didn’t want to be seeing multiple people at the same time. 

I lost a really really good guy, rare. Very rare. And I feel like I am to be blamed for it. Because I always kept delaying things and thinking that the guys should make all the efforts if they are interested.

I still halfway feel, had I been there sooner, it could have been me instead of the girl. Dating is really some tough thing and I think I got the biggest lesson.



My feelings:

I feel like I lost a very very good chance that I had because I took things too lightly. All this while I was thinking it is the guy who is not interested. But sincere guys look for investment from your end as well. And such guys are rare.

I feel this was so rare, I have this feeling of doom coming over me. I feel like I lost every bit of it. And I feel like just telling him to give me one chance even now. I feel like wanting to meet him. Talking to him. I can’t help myself. But I feel so helpless and upset.


Update: I stalked him and this guy was/is married (in 2020). Most probably was, because he is no longer connected to the girl. But I think that could change things now, given why his behaviour was so off. I forgot to mention that he had ghosted me 1-2 times and justified by saying we were in different cities.

This information changes the entire context of the post I guess. If there is any advice you have do share.. specially about if divorced men act different.
I am so confused.


Separately: Also, I think I need therapy too because I am finding myself attracted to such behaviour. Also creating false scenarios for things. For example demeaning myself by thinking my job wasn’t good enough and that is why he was cold and he might want high achievers, although I have a pretty decent job. I was tied to my insecurities and was latching on to his feeling, thinking it would help me get better and competitive (I hope you don’t judge me)",dating

1252,A homeless man took away my date! Only in NYC,"I was so excited to go on this date with a Google engineer. I thought he was intelligent, charming, and capable. We decided to meet right across from Lincoln center. There’s a small park that always serves the best coffee. As we sat down with our two lattes, we started to talk about politics, religion, and what we wanted for our futures. The date was going great. 

Then a homeless man approached us. He asked for some change. My date gave him a few dollars. At this point, the homeless man said I’m hungry. I wanted some food from the food stall my date, then stood up and walked over to the closest food stall. The homeless man explained he did not like this food stall he wanted to go to another one. A homeless man somehow talked my date into walking three blocks away from the park. I started to walk behind the two of them.  I clearly was becoming the third wheel on my date. I really couldn’t believe what was happening. After the homeless man bought whatever he wanted from the stall, he asked my date to go to Target with him to buy him underwear. My date explain to me it's important to treat people with dignity that's why my date left me to go to target with a homeless man. At that point I decided to go home I just know what else to do.",dating
1253,Is it weird if I (27F) never invite people back to my place and try to avoid disclosing my housing situation?,"I live in a HCOL city. My grandparents on my dad's side are rich and generously helped me buy a $1.25 million dollar single-family house. I live in it alone. I know I'm very lucky to come from wealth. I don't want potential romantic partners to know this yet about me, I want someone to date me because they like me, not because they think me or my family is rich.

I recently got out of a long-term relationship and have just started dating again. Most of the people I've been on dates with are living with roommates or in an apartment. When they've asked me about it, it always became somewhat awkward after I answer that I bought a single family house two years ago that I live alone in.

My friend suggested just don't disclose any of this until in a relationship. But usually the convo comes up earlier. And if I meet someone I like and always end up going to their place, will it be weird if I never invite them to mine?

1254,Anyone else feel like they have a perfectly amazing life minus the fact that they've had little to no success with romance?,"The effect that this seems to have is that it creates great polarity in my mood and confidence. Maybe this seems relatable?

I'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. I've only recently come to realize that my strategy of just focusing on myself and waiting for Ms. Perfect to come along and throw herself at me is not viable. I know it seems pretty late in the game for me to only recently have come to terms with that. Now I've realized that I need to actually ask girls out when I'm attracted to them. I understand that a huge component of getting a girl attracted to you initially is confidence.

I am always working on maintaining a consistent level of confidence, making sure that I come off as strong and centered (as Coach Corey Wayne might say) and demonstrating that no matter what happens, I will be okay. 

On the one hand, I feel immensely confident in myself because I have a great life. I am in grad school on a full ride scholarship, have above average grades, and I'm relatively thin, but with noticeable bicep muscles. 

However, I have to constantly try to keep my confidence afloat when considering my lack of success with romance in the past. I try not to dwell on it, but every once in awhile it just happens. Based on how successful I am in almost all areas of my life, I feel confident that I can attract a great girl to be with, but then I also consider that I have never done so before, and it throws some doubt into the equation. Anyone else in this same boat?

I guess it's best to just remember that ""It always seems impossible until it's done"" as Nelson Mandela said.",dating

He’s having trouble finding an apartment because his credit is shitty. All of these things, on top of being adopted and feeling he has NO ONE in this life has him constantly depressed and completely unhappy in life.

The other night he texted me at 1 am because he was drinking and basically accused me of being distant and all of this other shit. Next day he apologized and confessed he’s just embarrassed by his life situation and tried to push me away.

As I’m typing this I’m already noticing 50 red flags. However, he makes me feel as though everyone abandons him so I don’t want to be one more person to do that.

However… it is completely and utterly draining to deal with someone that’s so unhappy. I strongly believe even if he got an apartment he’d still find things to complain about in life. Should I run for the hills?

1264,"How to cope with recurrent opinion that a woman in her thirties without a boyfriend must have something wrong about her, if she is actively searching for years","I had a conversation with a date recently that has bothering me since... I would like to get views on this.

The guy I was dating is in his late thirties, and I am in my early thirties. He said he has been on the dating app for one year, and has not been interested in dating before due to his life situation (he dated in his twenties).

His question/opinion that bothered me was this - he said - can I ask, how come you haven't been able to find a relationship even though you have been on the app for 3 years? You are beautiful and interesting, and I don't want to put pressure on you or anything, but you are a 33 year old woman - to which I replied that I don't understand why it should have to do anything with gender, that I see many single guys in the forties and no one thinks that is wrong - to which he replied that men tend to date younger and women not so much and that at my age a lot of good guys will be taken... then he said that a lot of his friends are all good guys and they all have girlfriends, so how come it is so hard for me? To which I responded that I just haven't yet met anyone that really feels right... which he kind of didn't buy.

Honestly I get this opinion often especially from men, who believe that not being able to find a boyfriend seems to be a sign that something is wrong with you - and I do feel bad after having these conversations, I feel like there is some truth in the fact that as you get older it will be easier for men to date, because they date younger and young girls are interested in older guys, and it bothers me that this inequality exists... has anyone made any thoughts on this?

1267,Approached a girl at the gym and was happily rejected.,"So, before the critiques begin - please here me out! I’ve ‘struck out’ recently by way of dating apps, and I’m not regularly in social situations to garner dates organically. I visit the gym sparingly and haven’t approached women there before. Today was an aberration as after I arrived for a workout, I noticed a very attractive woman I hadn’t seen previously. As I begin my routine, I’m keenly aware that the woman continually glances at me (occurring in different areas of the gym), and I return the glance but I don’t stare. 

A routine I have is to visit the steam room for ‘concentrated breathing’ once my workout concludes. As I’m heading to the steam room I pass the woman while she’s in between  sets and we lock eyes and she gives me the biggest ear-to-ear smile, which I return. I enter the steam room and my concentrated breathing regimen is immediately forgotten about and exchanged for deep panting and total confusion, (mesmerized by her smile / presence). I decide that she ostensibly provided me with some level to justify approaching her. 

I leave the steam room and freshen up, then head towards the common areas where I see the girl seemingly resting in between reps. I’m nervous, the gym is crowded, everyone is aware of her gorgeous presence. I decide to approach. I remove one ear phone ( she does  similarly) ?and then say to her “ excuse me , I saw you earlier and I wanted to come say hello, my name is slim shady, what’s your name “ , She smiles and gives her name and then I ask her “ are you single by any chance” , to which she responds “I’m actually married”. My heart sinks and I blush with embarrassment as I’m aware that ‘ all eyes’ are on her and I. I smile and say to her,  “your husband is a lucky man “ and that it was my privilege and excuse me once again, see you around”. I begin the ‘walk of shame’ to the exits and leave the gym. Once in the car I’m quite surprised by the sense of relief I feel after making an attempt and not having the regret of passing on an opportunity , while also appreciating that she seemed open to my approach. 

I’m curious on if any others have a similar gym story, and how you ascertain or go about the propriety of seeking dates from the gym? 


P.s.

-begrudgingly , I’m aware that my interest in the girl was somewhat shallow and based primarily on her appearance. So be it.  This is planet earth.

1268,Am i wrong for finding this to be a complete red flag.,"so I (f19) went on a first date with this guy (m 21)  a couple days ago, we went out in the city to get food, and there was this homeless man who fell out of his wheelchair across the street. We immediately ran over to him and helped pick him up, as we got him back up somebody behind him at the bar, thanked us for actually doing anything. (everybody else was just staring). he didn’t even respond to that. He just asked the guy if he had hand sanitizer because he was “so fucking dirty” like he kept saying over and over again, and whining about how dirty that man was, and how gross homeless people are. and he said it in very close proximity to the homeless man, so he probably heard everything he was saying. like I get it, he might not be the cleanest, but to publicly humiliate someone like that who is clearly struggling is just such an ick 😭 like I feel more of a man than him, because I didn’t go out of my way to whine and complain about it, like, just go, wash your hands. I confronted him about it later, and he basically just said that he doesn’t give a fuck what I think about him and he was just stating the truth.

Beyond that, we had a terrible breakup as she cheated on me and hoovered for years - successfully getting phone sex once.

I happened to be single and also extremely horny so I let my brain shut off and walked over the second she noticed me. I leaned in and asked ""did you know you were gonna end up in my bed tonight""? She responded with the same shy giggle from highschool and took my hand.

We took an Uber back to my place where we spent the next 2 days absolutely screwing each other's brains out. Caught up in the moment, we both said we still love each other and reaffirmed that it was still the best sex. As she got ready to leave, she mentioned we should go for dinner this weekend to which I instinctively agreed.

Now that I have post-nut clarity and she's out of my hair, I'm not so sure I'm ecstatic about giving someone a second chance after they cheated on me when we were teenagers. Should I go with the feelings for once and see where this goes?

Although using the apps for so long, I never really had a connection with anyone or felt comfortable enough to meet with them. Whilst I haven't given up on the applications, they pale in comparison to real-life interactions. However, the other day I went to a bar with some pals and I noticed a guy seated at a table across the bar with some of his male buddies. We kept looking at one other. He was quite adorable. Well after a few drinks, I had the courage and thought oh what the hell, what do I have to lose lol. And went for it! I got up to his table and asked him what he’s drinking. He said some beer (I was too nervous and forgot it lol) and then I told him I thought he was cute…. And then he smiled and said he’s sorry but he had a girlfriend.

I don’t understand people’s need for continuous 24/7 contact. Perhaps it’s because I’m an introvert, I’m not sure, but it’s really rubbing me the wrong way. 

I started talking to someone on a dating app. We hadn’t even met up. Exchanged numbers but that was it, really. I’ll admit, I forgot. Simple as. Life happened. And I forgot.

I get this bitter text saying that “ghosting isn’t cool,” and it’s like, but, I didn’t? And I don’t owe you anything nevertheless? I understand this goes against the grain but the lack of empathy, understanding, and patience in the dating world is astounding.

Perhaps this isn’t what you’d like to hear, but you won’t die if you don’t date someone immediately. Give people breathing space. I see questions like “she hasn’t texted all day. Does this mean she’s not interested?” and it’s like, shit, chill. Out. It’s a turn off.

And yes, I ended up apologising. I also said we weren’t compatible. I was overly apologetic because I was made to feel like shit over a genuine accident.

Don’t be like this person.

I don’t owe anyone anything. 

It’s about intent. 

You’re in control of your own expectations. 

People forget. No, I won’t elaborate, because frankly, I don’t have to. This isn’t AITA. It’s a vent. Quit interrogating me just so you can feel justified in branding me as a shitty person because you, yourself have been ghosted. 

“You’re either interested or you’re not,” this isn’t an immediate thing. Stop expecting every single thing in the dating world to be immediate. 

“Pot meet kettle,” you’ve contributed nothing to this conversation except something simply that proves your self-righteousness. Then again, this is Reddit. What did I expect.

I’m tired, and I’m not here to justify myself. This isn’t the damn court of law. I won’t bend over backwards because you don’t have the entire context (if you did, we’d be here all day. I’ve things to do.).

1. Fails to have clear picture of who they are in first couple pics.

An attempt to hide identity on a dating app, and I'm not talking about the ones with revealing photos/fetishes who crop their face out.
2. Hiding first name or using initials. I matched with ""K"". Great start, K. 'K.
3. Clearly lying about age or pretending not to know how to change ones' age. Some apps don't allow you to update your age, but guess what - you can delete your account and re-create it with the correct info. Don't lie.
4. Profiles which *don't even try*. Like just being present should be enough to make you swipe right. Just pictures, no info, no personality. Even worse, when the pictures aren't even animated so you can't infer any info from them. I'm not speaking about new undeveloped profiles here, just those of people who don't even try.

1277,Is unprotected sex the new normal? (M29) (heterosexual),"Hi,

first off, this is not a p\*rn fantasy post or anything. Actually it is rather dangerous. I use mostly online dating. Most of my (M29) dates over tinder or bumble in the past months (F24-31) wanted to have **sex with me without a condom** **and wanted me to finish inside as well, either on the first or second date.** All educated women with college degrees and well-paying jobs (probably more than mine in most cases, I earn slightly above average). Unfortunately I can't say that I always declined. I do get tested regularly and I always have STD testing kits at home.

So far nothing bad happened, but **I am concerned that I will lack willpower to enforce condom use as my mind gets used to this being the norm**. **It has also happened to me that they just shove my penis in or sit on it without protection before a discussion even starts.** Ten years ago when I was in university, sex without protection was unthinkable to most people and basically every girl asked if I had some on me. Unprotected oral was always the standard, though - at least in my experience.

However, what is you experience with this? **Is this the new norm** or do I keep attracting the wrong kind of women? I do have shirtless pics on my accounts (ripped, six pack), but other than that nothing too sexual. I do flirt a bit in the chats and on the dates I escalate very quickly to making out.

**TL;DR: Women asking for or rushing into unprotected sex is more common than using protection with my online dates, curious about your experiences.**",dating
1278,First time getting stood up. Waited 2 hours. Have you ever been stood up?,"Lol drove 30 mins to pick up a girl for a date. Ended up not showing up and waiting 2 hours in her apartment complex parking lot. She was very responsive right before I said I was leaving to go to the location. Told me to park beside a specific car and asked what car I was driving like she was coming outside. she was taking like 30 mins to respond each time I followed up and I tried to call to see if she was okay. She said she had to finish something real quick and then no response for hours. 

What made it more funny is that she complained about dudes being flaky on dates and ended up pulling that on me smh. After hours waiting I just left to get drinks with a friend. I posted a story on ig and saw she was the first to watch it. Lol people are ridiculous. Has anyone been through something like this?",dating
1279,I’m just so tired of dating,"At first I just wanted an actual fwb- someone to hang out with and have sex with. But the guys I would meet wouldn’t get std testing, or would tell me they don’t wanna hang out at all unless it’s for sex, or they were in relationships, begging for threesomes, wanted to fuck me and 100 other women raw etc etc 

I decided I do wanna be with someone seriously. I haven’t had sex in months. I can’t even meet a guy who wants to date seriously. Guys have in their dating apps that they want a serious relationship, and when it’s brought up they switch up and say they only want casual. I don’t want casual anymore and I’m tired of doing gf/wife things benefitting the man and getting nothing out of it. What gives??? I see so many guys on here claiming to want a serious relationship, yet I’ve met 0 men who actually want a gf.

Edit: me- I have a hard time dating and finding men who don’t lie and put in effort.

1) Always know when to say goodbye 
2) A toxic person only changes their victims, never themselves

4) You can be the whole package at the wrong address.
5) There’s nothing like a perfect partner 
6) love is not always enough",dating
1281,This loneliness is killing me,"Female in my late 20s. I’ve been single my whole life, never had a problem with it. I thought love will come when it has to come, the right guy will come when he has to come. But…years went by and this never happened. While I’m a logical being, a side of me is a hopeless romantic and believes in true love…that there’s one just for me!  
I started dating seriously most recently and the experiences are wearing me out. I feel like I’ve hit dead end and I’ll never find my person. I recently met someone who was everything I basically wanted except he wasn’t ..we had a couple of dates and he flaked along the way. The classic hot n’ cold. I was frustrated when he didn’t put in the efforts. Now, I look at all these men on dating apps and think what’s the point ?! 
I’m starting to feel lonely!! Like painstakingly. I long for companionship, someone to hold me, listen to me, and go on adventures with. I’ve never experienced love the way I’m supposed to and I deserve to… i am so scared I’ll never find it. I feel lonely and exhausted.",dating
1282,I’m a single young guy trying to meet people and it’s absolutely brutal out here lol,"So I have had a lot of bad luck lately such as asking this really pretty girl at work for her number, seemingly getting a positive reaction from her thinking it could go somewhere but 3 times I’ve made plans with her and she’s flaked and ghosted me the day of, inexplicably.. 3 times. I actually feel I played my cards right in our brief conversations too. Must be another man right? Whatever moving on

The other night I struck up a conversation with really pretty girl outside of some bar area. Again, I seemingly got a positive reaction and her phone number only to walk away and turn back to see her approached by another guy in less than a minute and also exchanged numbers. I was so put off I just deleted the number, I just knew it was never going anywhere.

THIS incident tho. JUST happened right now and actually surprised me a bit, but not really. I’m hard at work during my night shift when I got a tinder match. I don’t even use tinder much I only have it since Im obviously trying to meet someone now. It’s a really pretty girl, a couple years younger than me, barely legal tbh. I strike up a conversation with her. It goes really well & flowing and we are actually talking about real things. We exchange numbers and we actually text for several hours all while I’m busy working my shift. She lives by me, says she’s willing to meet on my days off, this seems really good. Get this tho guys, she tells me that she is celibate. I’m not thrilled to hear it and tbh didn’t even fully believe it, but there were moments where she had me convinced. I told her it was cool with me all while thinking that I could probably still make a move when we met. Long story short, I did some minor investigation and it wasn’t long before finding her only fans. I wouldn’t pay for her subscription but I saw she had a “free only fans” so  followed… and Lo & behold the first thing I see. She’s riding some guy and multiple other videos all during the hours that we were texting. Admittedly, there were probably some red flags I should have spotted but I must be too innocent to understand how devious these women are.

I’m not even upset anymore it’s just really crazy out here like why try to play me like this just why lol",dating

We match on Hinge, we talk for awhile, they ask me out on a date, and we have a wonderful time on the date. Before agreeing to a first date I make sure we both get our intentions out there and are on the same page so we don’t waste each other’s time (I’m interested only in an LTR).

We continue going on dates and moving toward an LTR. They initiate physical contact (hand-holding, goodnight kiss, etc.) And then one day, without warning, poof! I get two-word responses to texts with hours in between them, and then I get the, “I’m not ready for a relationship right now,” talk.

1285,Guy i’m dating commented on my breasts,"I’ve been seeing this guy for a few months, and yesterday when we were having a shower together after having sex he commented that my boobs were uneven. 

He just randomly said it, we hadn’t been talking about anything. 

I had never put thought into if my boobs were different, in fact i’ve received lots of compliments about them in the past. But now when I look at them all I can see is the size difference and I feel so insecure.

1286,I just had the best date of my life,"I met this really cute guy (25) on a dating app and we had been talking and really connected for the past couple days, well today we agreed to meet up. He came over to my place then I drove us to a place in town for dinner. We had a great conversation at dinner and everything felt so natural and there was no awkward silence/nothing to talking about. He paid for dinner and we left. We went back to my place and played some Mario on the switch he brought. It was super fun! Maybe 30 mins into playing it he moved in closer to me and we played a little longer. He wanted to see my pc setup (since I'm a nerdy girl and I'm into gaming and such) so I said I'll show him. He then said but hold on there something I wanna do first and he kissed me. After we kissed a bit I showed him my setup and then he asked if I wanted to play the switch again. We played a couple rounds of just dance which was also super fun! After that we cuddled on the couch and chatted and then were scrolling through reddit together. Our date lasted till 5pm-2am when I finally suggested we both better get some sleep and he should head home. He agreed and I walked him out and kissed him. We have plans for Sunday to meet up again! 😁",dating
1287,"(21F) After sex, I end up feeling upset because most men quickly leave or ask me to leave. Am I right for expressing upset over this?","This is a continuing pattern for me. The last few times I've had sex, I wanted to cry afterward. Because the guy starts acting cold, or like he doesn't want me there. These are guys I'd maybe hung out with a few times, but not dating.

I'm the type of person who wants to cuddle after sex. I need affection afterwards. Feeling cared about after is just as important as during and before. Is this too much to ask from men?

Am I crazy if I express this annoyance to men after the fact? I just hate feeling used, and it's really starting to weigh on my self esteem. Maybe I should start a boundary of only having sex after it's an official relationship? Advice?

**EDIT, sometimes yes they have spent the night or vice versa. But it’s still that cold aloof feeling..

1289,"As soon as sex is off the table within the first stage of dating, people switch up so fast.","My (20F) personal preference is to go on a few dates first or keep getting to know the person until I’m comfortable enough to go down that road with them. As soon as I shut down their advances over text or in-person (I’m talking like people I’ve never met in person or have only started seeing), they just immediately pull away. Does anyone relate to this? It makes me feel kinda crappy and I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong.

EDIT: Wow this blew up overnight?! I really appreciate all the responses I’m getting. This post was made because I’d be speaking to a guy I met off a dating app and we seriously vibed personality wise. He started to make sexual comments after a while and when I told him I’d like to get to know him more before we go down that path (never said it was off the table, I just wanted to wait till a point where I felt okay about it), he switched up immediately.

There are other things than dating apps (especially ones like tinder) to find friends through, right? I expressed that and it turned into an argument, making things look even more sketchy in my eyes.

1293,I have just been picked up by a girl on a date I didn't know was a date,"Tl;dr: Girl from a friend group invited me to come swimming at a dam again. Kissed me, now we're dating.

So, I (21m) joined a group of local friends about 8 months ago. All of us young adults and teenagers. Things were nice, I never intended on hitting on any of the girls out of respect and all. We went to hikes, parties, events. 

Turning point came at around 3 weeks ago, when we visited Slovakia for a week and one of the girls (18f) apparently took interest in me and started to show it.
The saturday after, at a local concert back home, we spent a lot of time with each other, dancing and talking. The day after we go to a dam to swim. Most of the friends are there, I bring my dog and we have a nice time on a summer afternoon. I spend a lot of time with the girl in question and things get a bit flirty.

The week after I keep thinking about her and keep thinking it all over and over. Eventually I decide to make my move the next time we meet in a social setting. But on thursday when I get home from work, she messages me to come to the dam again at 6pm. This was a surprise so I arrive with my dog, thinking to meet all the friends there again, and to my shock, I find just her.

Ok, I'm not a complete dumb-o, but I'm still super shy and introverted, so it dawns on me where she is steering this and throughout the evening we openly flirt and have an amazing time. Eventually I ask if this is a date. She obviously said yes, it is! And I get super flattered and shy again ^^

When we are walking around the dam to the other side through a nice forest path, we talk about how girls can communicate and make entire sentences through just looking at each other. Fascinating. She tries to explain it to me, we get close and I ask:

""So what are you telling me with your eyes now?""

And she kisses me.

My brain shuts down and I apparently said something, but I honestly don't remember the next minute or so...


Anyways, we are dating now. We've seen each other almost every day since and had ""the talk"" yesterday so I hope this goes well!

Thanks for reading and I wish all a good one!",dating
1294,She‘s out of my league,"I matched with a super attractive girl on Bumble; she is very athletic, has a decent job and a funny personality.

We get along very well and make jokes etc. After just a few messages she hinted that she wants to meet and today I asked her if she wants to go out with me and she instantly said yes.

I am a little confused because it‘s just too good to be true. I am ok looking but she could do way better. My biggest assets are my sense of humor and my very decent job.

Has anyone of you had similar experiences? How did the story end for you and does anyone have some advice?",dating
1295,An hour late and goes to the wrong place,"Honestly it's ridiculous. I've been like 10 minutes late to dates before and felt like I got dinged for it. But this girl tonight is AN HOUR late. Originally we actually agreed on 8 but she switched it up in the afternoon, something about her son's practice, then 20 minutes before, when I'm already on my way, she texts saying she's ""still coming, she just got home and is hopping in the shower."" I get there at around 9 and tell her I'm in front of the place. She texts 30 minutes later saying she's ""on her way."" Then 15 minutes later calls asking if I'm there and says she's on her way, and when I ask how long she'll be she says ""10 minutes."" She calls me 20 minutes later saying she's at the place but it's the wrong one. So again I agreed to wait till she gets here. Now here waiting. 

Let's be real here, I am probably losing points with her for tolerating this right? Quick advice needed, what should I say when she gets here? Sure shit happens but come on this is just way too much. 

UPDATE: She finally showed up an hour and 45 minutes after we agreed to meet and she showed up HIGH. I stuck around for an hour just to be polite then made an excuse and left. Total waste of a Friday evening. I deeply regret not just staying home and playing video games instead.",dating
1296,This is the biggest mistake people do when dating!,"I have observed that many individuals often make comments such as ""I was attracted but there just was just not a connection."" 

From my perspective, if you cannot accurately define what a ""connection"" is, you might be missing out on potential relationships. 

I do not intend to offend anyone, but I find this kind of thinking to be irrational. When you meet someone on a dating app, you have no prior knowledge of their existence, and you may both feel awkward initially.

It's important to realize that building a relationship takes time and effort to understand the other person. This doesn't mean you should put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to a random match, but it does mean you should invest more time in your best matches.

 If you had a good date, but you did not feel a spark, don't worry, that's normal. Start by being friends with them and get to know each other better. 

Eventually, you may find the spark you are looking for. I'm not suggesting that you should give everyone a chance, but rather make a small change in your perspective.",dating
1297,It’s time that I start putting my feelings before others because it’s not like they give af about mine,"I’m just tired of being the one who reaches out .

I’m tired of giving energy to people who ignore me or who don’t wanna talk. I’m tired of being nice and putting a smile on my face when I’m sad and emotional. I’m tired of not having anybody to cry on when I need it . 

It’s so crazy how guys can have sex with you or lead you on and leave you in the dust for an ex or someone they think looks better. I’m tired of being compared and I’m tired of not being enough for someone. I’m tired of getting insecure men, cheating men, lying men, who bring down my spirit. I’m tired of men who only want sex or talk to you when it benefits them I don’t want to be your rebound or someone you past the time with. I want to be your one and only I want to grow old with you and have kids with you and get married . 

I want that I don’t want the leftovers from someone else that’s still taking chunks and bites out of you and you let them. I’m tired of not being first but second or third. I’m tired of being compared body wise and look wise and hair wise . I’m tired of being picked apart like a string cheese. I’m tired of caring about everything in general. I’m tired of being alone and lonely with no friends really and when I find someone I put all my energy into them and they leave .

Sex isn’t a prize to be earned, it’s a consensual activity between two adults.  

My roomie agrees it’s stupid but swears that most men won’t see you as a dating prospect if you put out too early.

So far I was just engaged in casual relationships where the main focus was having fun with sex, either for one night or for a longer time, but we didn't really connect more. This guy is filling out needs I didn't know I have and he is almost perfect, apart from the sex life, as he doesn't like foreplay. He only performs it because I asked him to, but I can see/feel that we doesn't enjoy it, so I don't enjoy it either. He says that he likes seeing me have pleasure but he doesn't really like the whole process and he prefers going almost directly to penetration. Of course I cannot make him to like it and I would not want him to pretend to like it. At the same time oral sex and generally foreplay is super important for me and I was used to have sex with people who fully embrace sex and actually enjoy giving me oral. So, at the moment I am in a very difficult situation where I truly enjoy my time with him, even hugging and kissing (which we do all the time) and he really turns me on, but as soon as we get our clothes off and I see him do the ""chore"" of foreplay I am turned off, so I avoid initiating sex overall.

Even if they work in the military where personal mobile phones are not allowed, they would at the very least inform you about how long they're going offline or make use of the down time they're given to contact you. If they're out at sea, they'll PAY (of course within their budget and no video call) to receive your message and send their messages. If they're having exams, they'll text you right after their papers are finished. Even if they have no time for anything other than toilet breaks, they'll read and reply to your messages because they like you, and being in contact with you makes them happy.

So yep. There's no such thing as ""too busy"". Aside from codependent relationships, a guy/girl who don't even text you back before they sleep probably isn't interested in you enough. The only exception is that they're dead or unconscious lying in a hospital bed. Nobody will treat the person they like with such flakiness.",dating
1313,"I just want to say that each and every one of you is a valuable, special person and I hope you find exactly what you want in life!","There’s so much negativity in dating. Why am I not good enough yet? Why is this happening? Why am I like this? Why are they like this? Why is everybody like this? Why is this so fucking boring? Why is this so toxic? No you.

It doesn’t take long for the process to wear on a lot of people. Over and over again. It’s easy to lose track of the important stuff. It’s easy to stop believing it. But the truth is all of us have value.

All of us. Don’t believe people that tell you otherwise. There isn’t just one kind of value. Value comes in all shapes and sizes. Often weakness in one environment is highly valuable in another. One size doesn’t fit all. It’s basically impossible to be completely worthless. There’s always a use for you no matter how bad things have gone. Sometimes it may seem like no one notices the value that IS in you. That shouldn’t keep **you** from noticing it. That should just encourage you to find a successful way to market it. If you believe in your value, share it. It should also encourage you to find other kinds of value in yourself. Why not? See the value in those around you. Respect them by trying to emulate it. There’s a lot of beauty in this world. Notice when you get better. Appreciate it. Value it. You’re amazing and you can be better too! Don’t expect dates from this. Just do it",dating
1314,What are your thoughts about going 50/50 with a man?,"Edit: I genuinely thank all the people who gave me advices. I made up my mind and will talk to him today in an appropriate manner. 

24F here. Dating a 34M for almost a year.
Now this question is coming out of pure anxiety and need for a solution. I swear I’m not being entitled.

I am an international student who can only work at her campus 20 hrs per week and also gets scholarships here and there. Not a great source of income. My bf however, is making over $450k in a year. Almost every time we go out, we split the bills. I come from a culture where men take care of everything financially and women just be women. My guy is American.

1317,"i feel a bit embarrassed about not being able to cum from penetration, do men really care?","i love having sex but i can’t or haven’t ever cum from penetration, only my vibrator. sex still feels really good and i kinda feel like i’m cumming the whole time, but i don’t have an orgasm. men sometimes apologize for not making me cum after sex and it makes me sad. i don’t want to be a disappointment and it’s not that i’m not into it, i just can’t do it. i’m wondering if men care about women having an orgasm? of course, i assume they want to pleasure a woman but is not cumming a dealbreaker? lol

EDIT: thank you all for your comments! i appreciate everyone who told me not to feel bad and that it’s normal. 

for the people telling me to use a vibrator during sex, i would love to try! i tried once with an ex and still didn’t cum but i think that’s more because our sex didn’t really turn me on. as for right now, i don’t have a partner so whipping out a vibrator with someone new isn’t very convenient lol. also, foreplay is really important, i just need more of it i think. and someone to find the right rhythm. 

i feel like i COULD cum from penetration, i just need someone who will really take their time and talk to me. honestly now that i think about it, i can get myself off with my dildo, just not a real dick…?! when i have sex, my mind kind of shuts off and it’s hard for me to express what i need in the moment which is something i want to work on. i just let them take control and make all of the decisions because i can’t think when i’m getting pounded 🥲 it’s frustrating but i’ll get it right one day!",dating

On the dating apps everyone says, they want something serious, but don't even interested in the other person enough, to ask a simple question...

In real life situations, every women I meet are either married, have a boyfriend, or don't want to date.

1326,Blocked after first date,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder about a week ago. I had a lot of matches but she stood out the most because she seemed very into me and always responded back quick. I never noticed any red flags in her. She was very nice and always complimented me. We eventually exchanged numbers after and started texting from there. She eventually suggested we meet up and hangout this past Saturday. I never felt like hanging out because we only knew each other for about 2 days or so. She eventually convinced me to meet at this restaurant and we did. We met up and hugged each other. We ordered food and sat down. I paid for the whole thing being the gentleman I am. Had great conversations and made eye contact the whole time and it felt like we were both into each other. We talked about our personal lives, made jokes, laughed, etc. After about an hour, we both decided to start heading home. We hugged again and went our own ways. She told me to text her when I get home and I eventually did. And that was it, never heard from her again. She blocked me on Tinder and my number. I am still in shock from this whole situation. I would never imagine someone like her being childish and blocking me with no explanation. I never want to get attached to a girl I’m not dating but this one hurts a bit. My best advice to all of you is never get too excited on the first date. Advice and support is appreciated!",dating

then she said she doesn't like swallowing pills

the other day she asked me if I would leave her if I got her pregnant. I told her of course not, which is the truth.

He asked to kiss me which I was okay with, but from there he started getting a little too touchy. He was touching my chest which I didn’t mind, but then he started peeking into my shirt and trying to pull it down which I stopped him from doing several times. I clearly expressed that I’m not the type to hook up on the first date so he stopped the touching but kept kissing me and asking me to touch his dick. I didn’t really want to do it but he grabbed my hand and…yeah. Now that I’m writing this, it sounds pretty awful, but I know I had multiple opportunities to just leave. I’m not sure if I’m stupid for not being more stern, overreacting, or I really did just experience something awful and the reality of it hasn’t set in yet. Either way, I suddenly don’t feel like dating anymore lol

1346,When did blocking someone become an acceptable way of ending things with them instead of talking things through?,"One thing I've noticed a lot recently is how positive and approving most people seem of blocking/ghosting their ex or someone they've been talking to without any further explanation. I understand that some people really are impossible to communicate with and won't take no for an answer, and in these cases, cutting off contact is really the only option.

But I'm shocked at how many people won't even try to talk things through and will just block you as soon as things don't go their way. Honestly I've always associated blocking with extreme cases such as when someone is harassing you or won't leave you alone after you told them to, but nowadays it seems to have become such an easy way of getting yourself out of an uncomfortable situation without putting any effort from your side. As someone who likes to get closure whenever it is possible, it really pains and frustrates me that some people have blocked me over some things I didn't even know would upset them. I don't mind being held accountable for my actions but I'd prefer to at least be informed what I did wrong before being blocked.

And since trying to reach out after being blocked would make you seem obsessive or like a creep, what else can you do but keep wondering what could've been if you'd talked things through instead. Not so long ago it was considered rude to end things with someone over the phone instead of talking about it in person, but now ghosting has pretty much become the normal way of breaking up. It honestly seems like we're enabling laziness and avoidance of confrontation and idk if that's a good thing. I get that some people may not be worth your time and explanation but at least give them a couple of words to let them know how you feel, if they won't accept it then block them, but at least say you've tried.",dating

The guy we met in an accident, we have been on one date. So no strong feelings or anything. 
He follows a bunch of pornstars on his instagram and it makes me feel like he actually pays for their phots and videos. It is a dealbreaker for me as it puts me off so much. 
Other than this, he is a decent guy with a stable job and good personal qualities. 
But at the end of the day, it makes me feel bad. 
I dont wanna bring it up with him because we havent been seeing each other long at all. But it still sucks and hurts. 
Does anyone have any experience in this area ?

UPDATE : Wow. I dint expect so many comments. Thanks everyone by taking the time to say their opinion. I ended up texting him that "" I dont think we should date anymore cuz thats a dealbreaker for me but i was not judging him or whatever...."" (what I actually sent him was worded more nicely) 
It followed by many texts from him saying that he is not using OFs and those people have been previous tinder matches. He then removed all of them and told me he would never use that as he respects women a lot to pay for it and the fact that he could be losing his job over it. 
Im giving him the benefit of doubt for now. But im going to move very slowly with him and upon the second ick, I will be out.

The problem is sadly the only way We can meet guys now is with online dating, literally people get weirded out if you talk to them outside in the real world and in the apps it’s just this never ending swipe-get ghosted. It’s a cycle. Guys meet me we’re having a moment and then things get slow, texts left on seen and I just know they probably matched with someone that was ok to hook up immediately and my rules are holding me from leveling with everybody else. I know this because one of the guys told me that’s the case. but also I’m not going to change my values and do something outside of my comfort level because everyone is so sex obsessed. 

So yeah, that’s all I wanted to scream in a pillow. Thank you guys for being my pillow.

1358,Test Run in Hook-Up Culture: Lessons Learned,"🚨 LONG POST ALERT 

First of all – this is a throwaway account because anything I post that is NSFW has resulted in the destruction of my inbox ☹ 

The thought behind this post is basically just to share my own personal experience with my trial run into hook-up culture. A little background on me: I’m a 29yo hetero female who had hopped from long-term relationship to long-term relationship from ages 15-25. In the last four years that I was single, I did the classic “focus on your career” move, spent time building friendships and I started going to therapy to deal with anxious attachment (which therapy helped identify), some self-loathing/insecurities and just major life changes (break-up, new job, moving, etc.). Sexual experience outside of self-pleasure was bone-dry except for one ONS with a past past ex who was moving away. 

Fast-forward to this summer, I decide to indulge in hook-up culture as I never have before. I love sex a lot and I was craving a man to dominate me in bed and I love giving head, which you don’t get from masturbation. So I download all the apps and off we go. 

The Men: 

First hook-up was a foreign man who spent a lot of effort trying to meet up. He was attractive, I was horny and I’m a sucker for an accent. Due to work, social engagements, and some weekend trips, it took about 2 weeks to finally get together to hook-up. He expressed he wanted a fuck buddy and for there to be multiple occasions. I met him at his place, had mediocre sex, made plans for next week and then he ghosted and blocked me. 

In between, there was some potential matches with sexting but never able to actually meet to hook up. Also one guy who I went on two “real” (not sexual) dates, but mutually did not move forward with a third. 

Second hook-up was a little better. We matched and hooked up the same day. Sex was a little better, multiple rounds and some decent conversation. We were both successful, had similar interests and got along well, but he made no moves to meet up for anything outside of sex. We hooked up one more time, but then not again for about a month. We made plans twice, but he stood me up both times after making me wait around all day. 

Third hook-up was a guy who fit the bill of someone who was exactly my type from a physical and personality standpoint. We chatted a bit online. I work about 50 hours a week and he works about 70-75 and our work schedules were not compatible, so meeting up was a challenge. After about a week, he came by my work during lunch for a quick make-out session in the car with heavy petting. We had great chemistry and it was a lot of fun. The week after that, he came over in the afternoon during my lunch break to hook-up. Sex was good and super hot and we agreed to meet up again. 

Recently, Guy #2 resurfaced asking to meet up again while I was trying to make plans with Guy #3. I didn’t want to hook up with two different guys within 24 hours of each other, so I decided to hold out to see if Guy #3 and I could make it happen. We never did.

The Realization: 

Finally, I’m not sure what inside me clicked. Maybe it was a culmination of all the feelings of insecurity and low self-worth that was bumbling up the last 3 months. What was I getting out of all this? Sex was good and it was fun, but nothing mind-blowing and I was always accommodating THEIR schedule. Additionally, I am a funny, attractive, interesting and successful woman, but to them, I was just a hole to fill. Not even a “How’s your day going?” before asking if I was down to do anal. Also realized that I was using sex as a way to bring value to a relationship. I thought if I offered sex, then I was giving men what they wanted and shielded myself from them rejecting my looks of personality. In the end, the rejection was they didn’t care about my looks or personality at all. 

So I mustered up the courage to do something I have never done in 14 years of relationships: set boundaries. I let Guy #2 know that I had a lot of fun, but we wanted different things. I asked Guy #3 what he was looking for and got a vague response of going with the flow and not wanting to feel like it needs to be anything. I made it clear that I wanted to be more than a booty call and didn’t want to waste his time if that’s what he was wanting. And so there concluded my hook-up phase. 

Lessons Learned:

1) If a guy introduces sex into the conversation early, even casually, he is testing to see if you’re down for a hook up. Next time, I will not engage. Change the subject or politely decline. 

2) From Guy #1 – the way a man treats me is NOT a reflection of myself. Being ghosted or blocked does NOT mean that something is wrong with me. 

3) From Guy #2 – I will never clear my schedule for someone who can’t honor their commitments. If he can’t even show up to a pre-scheduled fuck, then that should show how much he values and respects you. 

4) From Guy #3 – No matter how much I wish something could work, I can’t force it. Communicate my needs early and be okay if that is a deal-breaker. 

5) Lastly, sex with me is a privilege. Whether I give it to someone for the long-term or short-term, it should be treated as such by men, but more importantly by me. Will be more selective about who I sleep with in the future, no matter how horny I am. 

Conclusion: 

I wouldn’t trade this experience for everything. It was an emotional roller coaster, but I learned more about how I act in relationships than I did when I was actually in a relationship. Hook-up culture is not for me, but I don’t offer any judgment on anyone who partakes. At times, it was very fun. I thought because I worked a crazy job, had a great group of friends and a busy social life, that the casualness of these occurrences would not affect me. But no distractions in the world can get rid of the desire to just be loved. I never got mind-blowing sex or even a consistent fuck buddy, but I learned what my boundaries were and how to set them. I’d say it was a win.",dating

She will be out of town this weekend and I will be out the following weekend.

In terms of dating I am looking for someone of the similar caliber as me, one that is emotionally intelligent, financially secure (or has hard work ethic), ambitious and kind. 

I thought maybe online dating wasn’t the best for me so I decided to go out. I have been in many public spaces but I am rarely approached. I get stares often, especially when I enter a room. I ensure that I dress the part and carry myself with confidence. I have been told by a friend that it could be I intimidate people because of my confidence.

1365,I want someone clingy,"Honestly this is always a controversial topic, but I really want a clingy boyfriend. I know people call it toxic or it gets other dramatic or dismissive responses but honestly nothing feels better to me than something who genuinely just wants to devote a lot of their time to us. If they like working out I want someone who wants me to come along and even if we aren't exercising together at least I knew they wanted me in their space. Or maybe they like reading or practicing guitar but they'd genuinely rather me chill out in the room while they do that than be away from me. Someone who loves to text and include me in their plans often. And doesnt spare their affection, I feel like I never know how to bring this up early on but I also don't want to rope someone into something they can't eventually get into....anyone relate? And It's not like I expect to receive full effort without reciprocating it either, I always match the energy. Any advice to let people I talk to/flirt with know this without sounding like a red flag?

*EDIT* I just wanted to clarify that I have been in a relationship like this with a very clingy person for two years in the past, and I absolutely loved it, it ended for reasons unrelated to the clinginess, they wanted to spend much more time with me than I had ever spent with a partner before and it was amazing, they certainly would occasionally get upset if I didn't text well or take the time to chat them throughout the day but I didn't mind that and would much rather have that then someone who doesn't do those things. Not to invalidate anyones negative experiences with people like this, it is dependent on who you are and what your social life and hobbies are like, your relationship needs etc.",dating

That's sounds a little dramatic to me, but I'm curious what the internet thinks. I've run into a little bit of dating trouble since pursuing my masters, and have found some guys to be intimidated, though I dont understand why. I really dont care if I date a guy with more or fewer degrees than me, so long as we have similar levels of intelligence. Some of the smartest people I know only have a high school diploma, so I really dont care about comparing sheets of paper.

Is this really an issue for guys?

1368,giving up on dating - juice isn't worth the squeeze,"40 dates (past 3 months) sourced through online and warm environments. Got some flings and short term relationships but nothing long term. I'm almost 30 and never had anything long term. I'm not being picky either, these always end up with the woman rejecting me. Common rejections are a slow fade, saying no connection/chemistry after say 2 to 3 dates or even after sex a few times.

I'm a professional 6'1 blue eye caucasian male, I wear nice clothes and im muscular/lean and I'm in the top 5% tax bracket. Some people say I'm good looking but I very much doubt it, I'm seriously struggling it's like I can't attract any woman with my looks sometimes I get choosing signals.

Has dating gotten this bad for most men? I know quite a few other men who are struggling or is it me?  I feel like I've exhausted all avenues except for trying my luck overseas.

1370,American dating vs European dating.,"So not to be generalizing, but im trying to get a different perspective. Im American raised latino now living in Europe for 10 years, and it just feels like dating in EU has alot less boundaries than when I lived in the US. After reading alot of these dating threads, sometimes it feels like the ""replies/mentality"" of most people on reddit are very American based, where most reponses and expectations of people are so different from where I live. Feels like EU dating is alot more relaxed with less rules, and more freedom for each individual- onto the point of it becoming serious which usually take much longer than 6 months. You first need to show alot of patience, trust, and emotional stability as a man. Honestly I wish the women here had more boundaries and needs like American women, cuz sometimes here it's way too open and free. But on the other hand, as a man it is much easier to meet women in EU and have ""flings"". Just harder to get into relationships. Any similar experiences?

1374,My girlfriend keeps talking to her toxic Ex and I hate it.,"I don’t like going to other people about my problems, but this is a serious case.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 months, and she is extremely selfless.

About two months ago, she introduced me to her Ex, which made no sense to me, and we chatted for a bit.

And then, He started flirting with her and she didn’t mind it.
I was shocked to see she didn’t care and she said “We’re just joking” which I doubt.

Something came up with her Ex, and she showed her body to him to help him.
She felt bad about it afterwards and I told her to stop talking to him or I would leave.
She stopped, and things were slightly better after that.

A while after, He started telling her to kill herself, and she almost did.
Fortunately, I saved her life, and she was sent to a mental hospital for a week.

When she came back, she was a lot better mentally.

But then, very recently, she wanted to fix her “friendship” with her ex.

I couldn’t believe it, I just wanted to leave her at that point, but I needed to see it through, so I told her she shouldn’t talk to him at all, and she blew it off.

Last night, she wanted to do a sleep call with him, and we started our first argument.
I told her how toxic and manipulative he is, how he almost made you kill yourself, and how he flirted with you in front of me.
She played the victim card and said how I make her feel guilty.
She even had the guts to say how “we could take turns”, what the fuck does that mean?

Honestly, I’m tired of her shenanigans and I’m going to break up with her if she doesn’t realize everything she’s doing.

So please Reddit, I need your opinion
Keep in mind, this is actually my first relationship, so I’m stupid

TLDR: My girlfriend won’t stop talking to her ex who is the most toxic and manipulative person ever

1376,Date reveals she's poly,"Hey peeps,

as someone very unexperienced in dating, here's a story:

Been dating a girl for 1 month (only meetings, nothing more) really like her, she seems to really like me. Yesterday she dropped the bombshell that she is regularly doing SM sessions with changing partners, and she 100% wants to keep doing that even though she wants a serious relationship with me. Her reason is that one person couldn't possibly satisfy all facets of her sexual needs and some things she wouldn't even want to do with her romantic partner. According to her, she is able to completely separate sexual partners and romantic relationship. She even considers herself a ""helpless romantic"".

&#x200B;

I've thought about it and can't really wrap my head around it. It completely goes against my understanding of romance to know that she has other partners, SM or otherwise, while we are together.

Also, I don't buy the ""complete separation"" of sex and romantic feelings. She even dated one of her SM partners in the past. Who can guarantee that she will not develop feelings for one of her partners when she spends time with him AND has sex with him?

They aren’t stay at home moms, they’re simply unemployed stay at home girlfriends for years, and these same men who tell me they want an independent woman are absolutely happy to support these women who don’t have jobs.

I have seen this in both my male and female friends as well and I don’t understand.

1386,(20F) I feel bad for Ghosting a Guy(22M) on a Dating App for Being Scary and Creepy,"Hi everyone, I'm a female college student and I recently joined a Hinge to try and meet new people. I matched with this guy, let's call him John, who seemed nice and sweet at first. We started chatting and I felt like we had some things in common. However, as we continued to talk, I started to notice some red flags that made me feel uncomfortable.

For starters, John was very aggressive in his messaging. He would constantly ask me to meet up with him and would get angry when I said I wasn't ready. He also started sending me unsolicited photos that made me really uncomfortable.

We were talking for a couple weeks. Things started to get worse when John started getting possessive. He would ask me who I was talking to and get jealous when I mentioned other guys (Like family members). He also started making comments about how he could ""take care of me"" and ""protect me"" which really freaked me out.

One day, John started texting me non-stop, even when I told him I was busy with work and couldn't talk. He kept asking me to meet up with him and wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to feel really scared and uncomfortable, so I decided to ghost him.

Now, I feel really bad about it. I know it's not the right way to handle things, but I was so scared and I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to protect myself and get away from someone who was making me feel so uncomfortable.

I feel like I did what I had to do to protect myself, but I also feel guilty for not handling the situation better and explaining why I had to cut contact with him.

TLDR: I feel guilty for ghosting John on the dating app for acting scary

1388,A relationship is like building a house.,"When you build a house, the very first thing you need to do is build a solid foundation. After that you work on the structure or support of the house. The walls keep everything together, safe. 

When something breaks or a light bulb goes out… you don’t throw the entire house away. You fix the broken thing or change the bulb. You have to upkeep the house. When one stops working on the house, that’s when things start to fall apart. Just because you built the house doesn’t mean it’s done. There is maintenance, love and effort that goes into a house for it to thrive and stay in a good condition. 

Sometimes when one cannot upkeep the other has to take the strain and put in extra effort and vice versa, until they can get better and get back to it. However, when it’s left on one persons shoulders for too long…the house will slowly start to fall apart. Things will build up, problems will keep happening and frustration sets in.

When this happens some people, look outside the house for help. Which would help them for a short time, but doesn’t permanently fix the problems at hand. The work never ends and I don’t think people understand that with relationships. Especially nowadays. 

That was just an analogy I like that was told to me. ❤️",dating

After 3 years from that point, I learned to love her on my own realization. Albeit late, 3 years too late, I confessed to her in the middle of a weekend vacation (just the two of us). I'm glad she hasn't moved on completely and the vacation ended with us starting a new relationship as boyfriend-girlfriend and not just friends. Downside of this relationship is that it's long distance and it would take months for us to meet again but the wait will be worth it. Although, I do feel sorry for making her wait 3 years, but thats what happened and I'm happy where we are now.",dating
1391,Got dumped because I kept asking for sex when he didn’t want it,"I (f25) just got let go by a guy (m24) I’ve been talking to for the past 3 months because of my high libido and because I kept asking him for sex and he wouldn’t want it and that gave him the ‘ick.’ I think there were and are other things and in my heart of hearts knew that this wasn’t gonna work in the long run so I’m not super broken up about it

I respect it but how common is something like this?

Edit for clarification: I would not ask him over and over again or just like jump on him and go for it. I would ask him once and if he said no I would leave it alone and would maybe ask again several hours later or maybe the next day, depending on how it was feeling. And maybe this doesn't change the situation but it was a long distance thing and the specific instance he cited was within like the first few days of this trip visiting him so it was not like I was asking every single day/time I saw him/talked to him.",dating
1392,Men that follow hundreds and hundreds of Instagram models: why?,"I don’t think I’ve ever met a guy that doesn’t follow hundreds of Instagram models. But what most guys don’t understand is it’s actually very hurtful to the woman in your life. Every time you open the app you scroll through hundreds of beautiful bodies and asses boobs and faces and I think it’s desensitizing a lot of men to what’s actually real, to where they have a hard time finding interest in real women in real life. So my question is just: why? Why do you follow so many? Don’t you get sick of the soft core porn every time you open the app to look at what’s going on with your friends?

ETA: clearly you can never say anything bad about men on Reddit without blatantly saying “not all men”. Of course every man on the planet is not like this. But I talk to lots and lots of women who have the same exact experience as this.
And the amount of people getting mad over this clearly shows that there is some sort of emotional attachment to these Instagram models. I just asked a question, what is the reason for following so many? Just a simple question.
ETA: please stop commenting “I don’t do this” “my boyfriend/husband doesn’t do this” then this post isn’t for you. Im happy for you but I’m asking the men who do this.",dating

Although she declined very politely and respectfully and said she is not interested in dating at this point of time but we can connect on Instagram and be friends (not interested in being friends with a crush) but still I am happy that i said it and won't have a regret later.

1394,Has dating become noticeably more difficult for you these last few years?,"Guy in his mid-30s here, curious to read others opinions but my sense is dating and finding a relationship of really any kind seems to have become harder to pull off. I am similar to the guy Ive always been (at least no major physical changes-same weight as most my adulthood) and a heck of a lot wiser. But it just seems like women are a lot more withholding or maybe overly detached? Conversations on apps used to be a lot easier to get going and were more productive, but lately it feels like pulling teeth or an interrogation. Is there a general lack of curiosity shift I am not aware of? Isolation and lockdowns obviously is an easy reason but is that just it? Or has disillusionment just really set in society wide now? Not trying to be accusatory in any way, and obviously I’m a dude and I date women so maybe I am only getting half the equation🤷🏼‍♂️",dating
1395,How do I (21F) tell my mom (60F) that I may be spending the night at a guy's house?,"I'm going over to this guy's (21M) house tonight to play some board games and then have sex. I'm going to be losing my virginity to him. Although this is an NSA relationship, please do not give me the ""are you sure?"" lecture. I've been thinking about this decision for almost a year now and have done my research about casual sex & safety and have given it more than ample thought. This will be our 4th date and I feel very comfortable with him.

Anyways, he really wants me to stay the night. Originally when he brought this up on our 2nd date (he wasn't trying to convince me, but just put the idea in my head), I wasn't down with it, but now that we've hung out a few times, I feel comfortable with this option. However, my mom, who I live with, has always been very protective over me and if I told her I'm staying over a guy's house, she'd probably have a mini heart attack. My mom cares about me deeply, but sometimes it goes a bit overboard. Even when I get sick with a simple cold when I'm at school and I can 100% take care of myself, she gets concerned but she just can't help it.

How do I communicate this to my mom other than ""hey mom, I',m staying over at a guy's house tonight"" without getting a nervous reaction out of her? Don't just say ""you're an adult and should know how to be responsible"" because I'm well aware of this. I know it's embarrassing, but my mom always knows where I'm going whenever I walk out the door. I feel like she has this invisible hand over me.

Overall, I know this may not be a realistic goal right now (the not freaking her out part), but how do I minimize the impact?

EDIT: Thank you for your concerns, but I am \*not\* trying to sleep with this man with the intention he'll want an LTR. I established that with him earlier. Also, I kind of already screwed myself over by already telling her I'm going to this guy's place.

EDIT 2: Hey everyone, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you for all of the insight. I ended up just being honest with her saying I'm going to crash at his place. And again, this was a well-thought-out decision on my end and I'm happy it happened. I know losing it outside of an LTR wasn't something I originally approved of about a year ago, but after many nights of self-reflection, I decided when I was ready. My mom ended up being totally chill about the situation, although I'll never truly know how she's feeling on the inside, but that's not for me to ponder. ",dating
1396,Question for men who use dating apps,"I’m a 25/f who uses dating apps and I often see more guys who have their political tags as liberal.

1399,My boyfriend makes me feel insecure.,"
I, 18f have been dating my partner 20m for about a year now. if you feel like reading, i’ll warn you now because this is a lot. i’m just looking for any avenue to vent, truthfully. 

When my boyfriend and I got together, I thought it was going extremely well and that we were in love. I was, he was not. I say this because he mentioned to me that he preferred bigger boobs, so i was like alright. As a woman, i do not think my body is what any guy looks for, truthfully. However, later on, he told me that i really had neither boobs nor ass, and that he prefers ass > boobs, but of the two I have bigger boobs. 

I think it’s fair to mention that all relationships have boundaries. I don’t care about porn, but he told me that he doesn’t like to think about his partner watching it. I agreed and we settled we would be in a relationship without porn involved. 

So, a few months later, I caught him looking at women. now, i’m not stupid and i know men are going to do what they want to. I know men are horny all the time and you can’t stop them. however, i just feel that it’s disrespectful to do that in front of your s/o. now, i did take it extremely hurtful. i have BPD. This prompted the question: “why?”

He admitted to me that he did it because I was “not enough for him”. I asked him to explain, and he told me it’s my body. just not what he goes for. This made me very suspicious of everything. I checked his tik tok. that was my first mistake 

There were so many comments entailing what he wants to do to them and what he wants them to do to him. I mean, it wouldn’t be that big of a deal if the accounts were big and whatnot. They were small and he knew what he was doing. I asked him why. he said he felt like he was too good for me and he wanted somebody more his league. I couldn’t argue with that. 

he even told me that he liked a girl at work because she had a big butt and i did not. I am just not what he wanted. 

Then, i found out he was watching porn. in my house. when i would leave and go to college classes. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel defeated and ugly. I love him so much and want to be with him, but everytime he calls me beautiful, I fail to believe him anymore. I don’t know what to do. i could really use some helpful advice. I’ve genuinely only gotten “i’m sorry”

(p.s. i’ve read posts like these and to everyone who is thinking “well, he’s with you, isn’t he?”. he has told me on multiple occasions, that our relationship spawned out of convenience and loneliness on his part)


UPDATE: 

first of all, i would like to thank everyone leaving sound advice, i really do appreciate everyone’s advice. some were harsh, but i really think i needed to hear it. after some consideration and talking about things with him, i’ve decided that it is best for me and probably for him if we were not together anymore. he tried to tell me he loves me, but it probably isn’t love and i think i understand that now. i’m excited to move on with my life. i’m going to be seeking help soon so i don’t try and run back to him, i urged him to do the same. 

again, a huge thank you to everyone for taking time out of their day to help me. all of my friends don’t really know what to say when i explain anything to them, which is understandable. you all have given me an outlet to express my concerns and validate my feelings. thank you all so much",dating
1400,I want to meet a boyfriend naturally but I never go out? Is there any hope?,"I (23F) have tried so many dating apps and I’ve come to realize that it’s just not for me. I get a good amount on matches on them but I can never form a connection with anyone. I am better chatting in person than I am texting over the phone and I believe that’s why I can’t seem to find any viable dates online. 

I decided to delete every single one of my dating apps altogether and try to meet someone organically. This makes me a little nervous because I don’t know if I WILL meet someone this way or how long it will take. 

I don’t have a car so I don’t get out much and I’m just nervous that it’ll take years to come across someone naturally.

I have no clue how to feel. A part of me is saying that it's a good thing because she loves me (she says) and is with me. But there's a part of me that is hurt when I think of that.

I was feeling pretty confident and had some computer work to do. So I decided to head into my town, grab a brew and chill with my laptop. 

The amount of eye contact I got from attractive women was quite eye-opening. I just started smiling at each woman I made eye contact with - surprise surprise. It was all really positive. 

All the women I smiled at smiled back and at about 50% looked shy and/or quickly adjusted themselves. A couple of the women walked by me a handful of times trying to get my attention. 

I'm only average in looks. Moral of the story? Being confident, good eye contact and a smile is surprisingly effective in catching someone's eye.",dating

It usually is said to a woman in her late twenties or early thirties who is concerned about not finding a man and who then lists her qualities/advantages in life.

I cannot imagine a man not appreciating a woman with a good career and financial independence unless the guy is very rich. 
Even then - a woman with her own interests in life is to be appreciated. 
Anyway, in this day and age of financial instability, I think a woman in her late twenties who has a good income, a good job and is independent is highly sought after.

1410,"Ladies, if you want him to make his move, give him SOME kind of green light!","*Caveat! Of course this may not work 100% of the time but..... idk, over 90%???*

I'm a super f*ckin' shy dude. 99 times out of 100, even if it really seems like a girl likes me I still won't make my move on the off chance I'm misreading the situation. She may be smiling alot, laughing/giggling at all my dumb jokes, even touching me frequently. But I still won't shoot my shot most times because I know some girls are just super flirty like that with everybody.

That said there have been more times than I care to remember where I realized too late that: "" Ah shoot! That girl probably actually liked me and would've said yes if I'd only asked her out!!!""

However, this girl I've met recently through a mutual acquaintance? I find myself saying the most ballzy-romantic things to her, making her swoon. We keep making time to see eachother even though we're both super busy. I'm usually never this real, vulnerable, authentic and brave with girls and I'm still not quite sure why it's so easy this time. But one thing I do know - SHE DIDDN'T LEAVE ME WONDERING WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF ME.

Right from the first date she was telling me how handsome she thought I was, giving me compliments on my physique, telling me how much fun she was having and by the end of the 1st date asking about when we could see eachother again and making plans to do so.

So ladies, if you like a guy and want him to go for it, for f sakes give hime SOME kind of clear, un-ambitious, straight-forward sign that he's got the green light. We're tired of playing detective. We also have been burned in the past by times where we made our move on girls, only to find ""she's just friendly like that with everyone,"" or the like.

Again I don't promise this will always work. But I will promise you'll have ALOT more success if you just f-ing tell him truly what you think of him instead of sitting back waiting. It's not always that we miss you're signals - most times we don't, in fact. It's that they aren't clear enough to trust we're reading them right.",dating
1411,"Women, ask men out if you're interested in them.","Unsolicited advice prompted by a recent experience. It is 2022, you don't need to abide by the societal norms from decades and decades ago. 

I have seen people here asking how to know if a guy is interested, how to push men towards dates, etc. Just ask a man out if you find him attractive and are interested in seeing them. I think not doing that is based on not wanting to look ""desperate"" or being worried about rejection, or some expectation that if a man is interested he should ask. This is all silly. Sure there is a chance of rejection, welcome to the world of men. You'll be fine. 

On the upside the few times I have been asked out by women I have found it extremely flattering. I recently had a great match on Hinge and we were both very much into the conversation. Just as I was thinking of how to pivot into asking for a date, she asked me. It put a huge smile on my face, and we are getting together in a few days. 

If you feel like a match is flowing well, but they haven't asked you out quite yet, lock it down yourself and ask. Maybe they are going to be busy that week or they have to go out of town so they don't want to ask yet, maybe they are shy, maybe they are laboring over how to ask or think they need to find the right opening. Maybe it is someone you know in real life and they aren't asking you out because they aren't sure if you're single, or they are nervous about how to get a 1 on 1 conversation with you. Maybe they got shot down recently and haven't gotten their confidence back yet. 

Just ask, they will probably say yes. If they don't want to they weren't going to ask anyway and you have lost nothing. If they are turned off by a woman asking them out they aren't worth your time anyway, so you saved a few bad dates.",dating
1412,Tried making a move on a guy and I failed,"25F I’m sitting at a cafe and I see a cute guy reading a book alone at the front. I tried to make a move by sitting next to him but didn’t want to be a creep so I waited a few more minutes before doing it.

I sit next to him and I’m on my phone, doodling on my journal, drinking coffee and the only interaction we had was me asking if I could sit here. About 30 minutes later, he gets up and leaves! I had all that time to ask him out or give him my number but I needed more time😅 and I was conflicted about my intentions because he’s cute and I’d want to hang out with him but I’m not ready to date so I was trying to figure out in my head how to go about asking him - if he wanted to be friends and read together😭 clearly I was overthinking and before I knew it, he’s gone and I lost the opportunity!

Either it wasn’t meant to be or I screwed up a potential connection so now I’m gonna stuff my face with food to self soothe🥲

Men of Reddit- next time this happens, can I just walk right up to the guy, hand him a piece of paper with my number on it, say “here you go” and just walk away? I have no problem doing this but I was worried it would be too forward and come off as aggressive?

Edit: I also think I came across as uninterested bc I moved the chair a few inches away, I crossed my legs away from him, and my overall body language was closed off(I was covering my journal from him). This was subconscious- I was interested, I’m just generally a reserved person or can come off as.",dating
1413,"After 4 years of being rejected/ghosted/stood up, I (30m) finally had my first date","Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well.

I just wanted to share that after getting rejected/ghosted/stood up for 4 years, I finally had my first date with a lovely lady for 8 hours. We met for dinner, had a bunch of laughs, played pool and then talked outside on a bench at a park.

She texted me the next day saying she had fun but didn't think we were a good match. I told her no problem and that she's a fun and interesting person so I'm sure she would have no trouble finding a good partner and wished her the best. She was very genuine and I'm really glad that she was my first date.

I don't know why I had such a bad experience with dating for many years. I always felt really bad about waiting for someone who never planned on showing up. But I always took myself out on ""dates"" after the fact. I got to meet great people along the way. For example, I became great friends with the staff at some of my restaurants/venues that I chose for a date. 

I think this one date made me happy that I went through the trouble to finally get to experience something new in my life.

I just wanted to share my experience for anyone who may feel like their efforts aren't yielding any results, because that's how I felt for awhile. I wish I didn't have to wait so long but I'm glad I pushed through and got the experience I've been wanting for so long.

My next goals in life is to get my first kiss and get a second date. Hopefully these goals comes sooner than a couple years.

Another thing I'd like to say is, learning from these experiences, I told myself I don't want anyone to feel the way I feel when I get ghosted/stood up. So I'll never ghost anyone or stand someone up on a date. If I don't feel like it's a good match, I'll communicate honestly and give closure.

So I’ve been with my girlfriend for a few months, but we’ve been friends for a few years we recently realized that we actually have been attracted to and love each other for awhile, we’ve both just in relationships at the wrong time. She has a son who’s dad is not really in the picture, he was a drug addict, who left when the kid was young,  he lives in a different state and doesn’t really call very often. The kid is 9 and he left when he was 3 to give some timeframe. But when he does call she puts him on speaker and all talk together, which I have no issue with at all, i usually just leave the room to give them some space. But what I’ve noticed is when they get off the phone she always says love you to him or he says love you and she says love you too or we love you, which I kinda thought was weird but never mentioned it. So this morning she got a call from him, and and was going to ignore it since her son was with his aunt, but she accidentally answered it and had to chat for a couple minutes, but when they got of the phone he said I love you and she said love you too.

As such, I’m way behind on picking up appropriate social cues for this kind of thing.

In the past two months, though, I’ve been hanging out with a really cool girl (24f) I met on Hinge. We started off chatting about mutual interests on the app, which progressed to a few coffee and dinner dates, to the point where we’re texting every day and holding hands when meeting up in person. We’ve seen each other in person once or twice a week due to work and other stuff in our schedules.

I do know that it’s important to explicitly establish exclusivity (and she commented that she was frustrated with the last guy she saw because he had bad communication regarding that). I also noticed that, on one of our dates at a farmer’s market, she commented at a stationary stall that she likes to write postcards to her friends. So my plan is, by next week I’ll get a postcard, tell her how much I’ve enjoyed these past few months, and ask her to be my girlfriend/be exclusive.

1420,I wish I realized earlier that butterflies are so overrated and unnecessary to fall in love,"When I was actively dating I would often come here and read how people “knew right away” when they met their SO, how “when you know you know” and that it usually doesn’t work out if it’s not there from the beginning. I really wish I read more posts and comments about people who fell in love with time and how different that experience is.

I met my current partner in September last year, and I really didn’t have a feeling like he is the one, I wasn’t sure and I admit I was disappointed I didn’t feel that butterflies everyone talks about. However, he was everything I could ever wish for and I made a conscious decision to really give it a chance and see. Five months later and we just moved in together, I am falling for him so deeply, everyday that feeling grows more and more. I feel like I am genuinely falling for him as a person, not for some image I made about him in my head as it was with people I felt butterflies with.

I would like to make this post to share our experiences with slow burning to also show that love can develop with time and it might feel much more intense and deeper. How long did it take you to fall for your partner? When did you realize you were in love? Were you doubting your relationship because of initial lack of butterflies? What made you decide to give it a chance? Are butterflies in stomach prerequisite for falling in love in your case?",dating
1421,Do most men not receive compliments or I have just been unlucky?,"Early thirties hetero guy here and I almost never receive a compliments except from other men. Even when I’m on dates with women, I’ll compliment them but they’ll never compliment be back. Not even so much as a you look nice or thats a good smelling cologne….nothing.

1422,is having sex on the first-second date a turn off for guys?,"Recently I've (F27) been trying to date and It's working so far. I have enough dates and I'm meeting some guys. When I have a great date with a guy I normally want to go all in so we have sex pretty soon, with this I mean like a second or third date, and I like that. The problem is after that there's no next date. I asked some guys and they never responded and with other I just don't feel ready for rejection again.

I don't know if it's the sex ( which I don't think it was bad most of the times ) or if it's the having sex so early that makes them lose interest.

Any advice?",dating
1423,What makes men look at a woman as relationship/wife material?,"Is it true that hot and beautiful are not the same thing? When a girl is objectively “hot” do you think of an instagram model who shows her body and not girlfriend material? And “beautiful” is certain features and personality etc. and is more conservative. i am curious, since my experience in Europe with men was vastly different than the men in the US, where they seem to want more of an emotional connection, therefore focus more on your faces and eyes. Thoughts?


Edit: I see a lot of responses that say “not argumentative”, but intelligent. Do you mean not picking fights and emasculating you? That’s reasonable. But if you want a woman who is intelligent, she is going to challenge you. I hear a lot of men say they like intelligence, but I’m convinced they actually don’t want to be challenged by a woman, mentally or emotionally. Not all of them, but a huge majority from my experience",dating

1425,Is it commonplace for a guy to confirm a date they day of if he planned it?,"Context: A guy asked me to get drinks and dinner tonight a few days ago. I said yes and gave him a time window. He said he was putting in a reservation for a certain time, I said it worked for me, and then silence for over 24 hours. I messaged him a little over an hour before the date I could no longer make it due to the severe storms that were in the area. I didn’t hear back until 40 minutes later. He messaged me 20 minutes before the reservation time that he was just now seeing my message. He was upset, but I really don’t see how he could be if he stopped talking to me over 24 hours before the date mid-conversation planning. My question is should the person planning the date confirm the day of? It feels almost impolite for me to as he was planning and paying for it. I was surprised he was upset and almost assuming we were no longer meeting up due to never hearing back.",dating

That's all I wanted. I'm happy :)

Edit: some of the ""negative"" comments are funny. He asked for my consent to hold my hand and such over text before the date, and afterwards made sure I was still comfortable with it. Me being introverted, I wanted to challenge myself to take initiative and ask him in person first since I already knew he would say yes anyways.

I haven't been able to find a relationship at all even though it's been almost a year and a half. I've met some people online but nothing has gone anywhere. I've only been able to go on a few dates cuz people I meet online always ghost me before we even set up a date or just never respond after matching with me. Thus fucking sucks.

I also like compliments on my eyes, body affirming compliments (like he likes the parts that I'm insecure about), and compliments on specific details on my personality. Do you guys like being called handsome or fine or hot more? What makes you feel butterflies more than the others? I want to be able to compliment men that I like with words that make them feel good. I also want to know what kind of compliments you all value more, compliments on your appearance, compliments on personality, compliments on the things you do for us. Yeah",dating
1431,Just got hit with the “too busy for a romantic relationship” excuse,"I (38F) met this guy (35M) on Bumble and we clicked right away. He was funny, a great communicator, and I was super attracted to him. He was really attentive and did all the sweet things right away - pulled me on an empty patio to dance to Michael Bublé after date 2, deleted his Bumble date 3, turned my Claddagh ring around to show my heart was “taken”, took our “first picture” at a baseball game (implying there’d be more), always gave me little kisses and held my hand. I know I know. Usually I’d be on high alert because men have done too much too fast in the past and it was bad news. But for some reason I let my guard down with him. He never pushed for sex; I initiated the one time we did have sex.

About a month in to dating, I could feel he was pulling away. I messaged him the other day to see his plans for the weekend and it took him 10 hours to respond. He hit me with the “I’ll be busy in the foreseeable future and don’t think I have time for a romantic relationship. If you’re open to it, I’d like to be friends.” I’m sure that’s just an excuse to let me down easy, but if all true, why be on the apps?? And how does life getting a little busy mean you can’t date at all? So frustrated to get rejected again after believing all his crap.

TLDR - Let my guard down with someone, believed them, and got rejected because he’s “too busy”.",dating
1432,how do you initiate sex?,"ive (F, 29) been seeing someone and we’ve had sex a few times before, those times have been planned so we knew that we both wanted it and expected it when we were together. i was at their house just watching movies the other week and i wanted to be closer to them but omg i felt so awkward! i didn’t know what to say or what to do, i don’t know how to make the first move and i think they struggle with it too. 

how do you initiate sex? do you suggest doing something else first, like cuddling? do you say something? what do you say? i have no issues asking “do you want to have sex?” other than having to hear myself say that out loud! do i need to just get over myself? i have never really dated before (outside of fwb situations) this is all so new to me!! help!

edit: neither of us are men if that helps! (didnt realise that would be important info my bad)

edit2: some people are being rude in the comments and i just wanted to say i asked this question because i needed the reassurance from strangers that what i was doing was correct/how people usually do it and some tips because fundamentally i don’t understand why anyone would want to have sex w me (even tho we’ve had sex before?!?) 🙃 its a me issue i know

edit3: what ive done before - had sex, had hook ups, had fwb where we message each other to hang out with sex on the table (sometimes literally lmao) what ive never done before - hang out w someone, things get hot, have slow escalations up to sex. i know i know, ive done things ass backwards. such is life.",dating

I foolishly stayed.  He keeps bringing her up and last week I said have you blocked her number on your phone and he said 'I actually deleted her number a few weeks ago so that when we are going through a hard time I won't be able to actually contact her when tempted'.

1441,Do men stop caring about you after sex?,"I (24F) recently went on a date with a guy I really like (28M), who I met on Hinge. We started chatting in instagram a week before actually meeting in person, and during this time I developed feelings for him, which only increased when we met - i went to his place, we slept together, and he told me many times what a lovely evening he had. In the week leading up to this, we were texting constantly, he never left it more than around 30 mins before replying to me, would send lots of voice messages, and we would text for hours late at night. 

THEN starting the very day after our date, all of this stops. He did say he wants to meet again, but hasn’t given me any specific times (and I don’t want to seem needy by asking again). He leaves it 6, 8, sometimes 13 hours before replying. Yesterday he only replied once the entire day. 

I get that some people just aren’t online as much, that is totally fine, but why would his behaviour change so suddenly and so obviously right after our date, despite us both having a great time and despite him saying we will meet again? 

I have had a LOT of bad experiences with men, and it’s really hard for me not to take this personally and feel sad about it. The fact that we slept together makes me feel discarded and worthless. 

Is this something men do? That is, ignore you after sex, even if they had previously expressed interest in something more? I have experienced it a lot, and it never gets easier.",dating
1442,"Rant: 65,000 seconds in a waking day. Only takes less than 15 seconds to message someone","The excuses that someone was too ""busy"" to respond, or considers you ""needy"" because you double texted hours after not getting a response to your first message, is BS.  They are either not interested, and/or are seeing or focusing their attention on someone else, leaving you as the back up plan, or playing a childish game to play with your emotions and keep you on the hook.  

Ladies and gents:
As the title says, there's ALWAYS time... if they WANT to make the time.  We take our phones everywhere.  Even into the bathroom.   

If someone can't be bothered to stay engaged, then cut them loose.  They are showing you how much (little) they mean to you.  Know your worth, mates.  

If YOU are doing this to your dates or interested parties... STOP IT!  Sh*t or get off of the pot.  Stop using people's feelings as a source of validation.   If you are genuinely ""too busy"" to communicate, then you should not be dating.  Period.  If you are seeing someone, either take yourself off dating platforms, or be honest and say so.  

If I am out of line, or any of you disagree, I welcome your interactive comments.

1458,Just when I thought I was done I hit the jackpot,"So as a little backstory I’ve been in a few relationships before but nothing huge or super long lasting. Most of them ended naturally, 2 of them by cheating, and the last just because of distance and recently I hit a super rough patch in my love life. I had basically just given up hope of finding someone I actually enjoyed being around and who actually wanted to spend time with me and not just get free food or a quick hangout for entertainment. But yesterday I had the best date I think I have ever had. It seriously felt right out of a movie. I met up with her at the museum of art downtown and we spent a solid 4 hours in there just walking around, joking about the art, and getting to know each other. We have a super similar sense of humor and she’s very inquisitive and I know a little about a lot so it was her asking a lot of questions and me explaining what it was. I’m also not super comfortable with public physical contact and stuff like that but with her it felt so natural, we walked around holding hands, my arm around her waist, or hugging and it was amazing. By the time we left it was 4 hours even though it felt like 30 minutes had gone by. We went through the gift shop, I wasn’t planning on getting anything but I remembered she was really interested in the Roman and Greek coins so I picked us up 2 coins and gave her one and kept one so “we’ll always have a momento of our first date”. After that we went and got food and spent another hour just talking about life and relationships and everything in between. By the time we left it was already a 6 hour date and I didn’t want it to end. But we ended up just hugging by our cars (literally one of the best and most comfortable hugs I’ve ever had) and I gave her a kiss and we joked some more and as she was leaving I softly grabbed her hand and spun her around and kissed her again. Now we’re setting up plans for our second date and I’m so excited. I’m telling you the idea that it comes to you when you’re not looking for it might actually be true.

I was in a perpetual funk so to speak. I thought at the time a relationship would fix everything. So I did all the desperate single-person things; I downloaded all the dating apps and went to bars, clubs, and parties. I got quite a few first dates but nothing beyond that. I was really down in the dumps but I was still super obsessed with finding a girlfriend thinking that would be my golden ticket. It wasn't until I got my heart broken by a girl was until I realized ""wait, this is making f\*cking miserable."" So I decided to take a break and think things over. I then started doing things that made ME happy. I started going to museums, book stores and picked up that writing project I abandoned months ago. I also started taking fitness and weight loss more seriously lost 3 pounds already. I rediscovered my love of hiking as well, there are a lot of trails near me and I just booked a trip to Wyoming in a few months. I joined a political group for a cause I strongly believe in and met some people who are very like-minded to me. My favorite thing I found is, I volunteered to be a rowing coach and it's the most fun I had in months. Another thing, ever since I started doing my own hobbies and stopped caring as much, women find me more approachable because I'm not giving off the same desperation vibes I used to. Do I still want a girlfriend? Of course, but it's not consuming me the same way it used to. I know everyone on this sub says to ""work on yourself"" and y'all have probably heard it a million times but it really works. Give it a shot.

Edit: It's not like I'm giving up on dating or finding someone. You can work on yourself and still date it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I'm still leaving the door open. But make dating a side show not your focus.

Edit 2: I'm not perfect. There are times when my singleness really bothers me, or I have bouts of loneliness. Usually, after a around the holidays, Valentine's Day or a romantic scene in a movie and whatnot. This is normal.",dating

When someome plays these games, it's an instant turn-off, and I end up ghosting them. Even when I initiate and they don't respond back, I leave it at that. I assume they're not interested and I don't ""chase"".  Even when they finally send me a text back after a week, I ignore it and cease further contact. Especially when I am always the one who initiates and makes effort in the relationship.  And then they start complaining ""He was a jerk for ghosting me!"".  No!

1475,My Girlfriend Wants an Open Relationship.,"I just started dating my current girlfriend. We had a talk about some things I am not totally comfortable with, because I was trying to make her aware of my boundaries, as she made me aware of hers. I knew some things that I had to say we would have to have a deeper discussion on, and we did. It caused an argument, but a very very controlled one. We decided not to call tonight, but I made sure to tell her that I loved her and that I care about her. She texts me about an hour or so later a long paragraph talking about how she may want an open relationship, and my heart was shattered. I am a very one on one person in relationships, and never in a million years could go into an open relationship. The issue is that I really do feel for my girlfriend, and wanted to get through it. We texted about it a bit, and she told me she would be willing to give a closed relationship her best effort, because she really does love me. She accompanied that message with saying that I can’t be mad if her feelings change. This gives me extremely mixed feelings on whether she really wants to try or not. I love my girlfriend a lot and would love to have a future with her. We are both still young, and I was thinking that this could possibly be a phase but I wasn’t completely sure. Is it likely this is a phase since we are still only in high school? And is she being honest with me when she says she will give her best effort?",dating

- I’ve dated older men. If “age is just a number” was true, I wouldn’t have firm boundaries about not dating older men now.

- There’s no good reason for you, or the guy I was talking to, to lie about age. You’re not the exception and neither was he. 

- I’ve already dumped and blocked this guy. I’m not going to “give him a chance”. He’s a liar- what more is there to say beyond that?

- “everyone lies on dating apps”. I don’t? I’m not going to accept that and neither should you.

- this isn’t a man vs. woman thing. You don’t need to tell me “women lie too!!” I’m bisexual, like….shut up",dating
1477,Went on a date with a guy and now I don’t think I can look him in the eyes after I know how his bathroom looks like…,"Hello Reddit👋🏻 
still kinda confused around here because this is my first post. Also english is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes or typos🫢 

Anyway now to the story. Today I (19) went on my first ever Tinder date with a guy (21). We had a good conversation there but he was not my type. But I gave it a go anyway. 

We met at a big park that’s in the city we live in. Everything went fine. We had a good chat but nothing really clicked. It was also quite cold outside so after some time of walking around I got cold so we ended up going to his place that was nearby. He told me a few times that since he did not expect me to come to his place, he didn’t clean. I brushed it of since I have stuff lying around my room as well so no big deal.

When we came to his place, I got a little shocked how messy it actually was. Then I went to the bathroom and I got horrified. Supposedly white toilet and shower was brown (almost black). Washbasin was covered in hair from his shaver and basically everything was rusty or half-rotten. Not to mention the smell. When I gave it a little closer inspection to the living room, when the guy was using the bathroom, it was nothing different. Then we started watching a movie but after ten minutes I knew I’m not gonna be able to stay there much longer. Fortunately my friend gave me an emergency call pretending to be my cousin   I forgot to drive to their scout club. It worked an I managed to get out. 

Now to the thing I need yall’s advice about. 

What should I do since I don’t think I wanna see him again but at the same time I don’t wanna be rude or impolite by ghosting him since we had quite good conversations before we met irl?


LITTLE UPDATE YALL✨
Thank you all for your comments. I really appreciate them. Anyway the update is that the guy texted me next day that he was thinking and that it was little sus that I went to toilet quite often at his place and was on my phone a lot. And also the misterious cousin call was just a way of me getting out. Idk what went into me but I just said that he was right and I got quite scared about the look of his place.

Then the conversation went like this:

The guy: hey i know my place is not the best but I think i deserve to be treated with respect. And you should have just said that that you don’t like my place and you wanna leave.

Me: ur right. Sorry. It just threw me out of ballance and I wasn’t thinking the way I should have. We had a good conversation irl and on-line but your place is a deal breaker.

Now I’m waiting for his responce because he left me on seen.



HOPEFULLY LAST UPDATE✨
Thank you all so much for all the comments and advice.  I’m definitely taking all your morals to my future dating situations. Anyway the update is that even after almost five days I am left on seen which is also an answer as some of you said. I don’t personaly think I will get any other answer than silence at this point.

There has definitely been errors on both sides that could have been handled better then they really were. But that’s the dating dangers I quess.

1480,Double standards are disgusting,"I'm a guy. I find double standards to be disgusting.

I'm 35 and single, I was engaged in a 6 year relationship.

I've had quite a few women when I tell them I used to be engaged get really upset at me that I didn't get married. I left my ex-fiancee because she was randomly abusive. She was a smart, hard working gal that looked out for me well but when we would spend time together she would ""playfully"" punch me hard, pinch me hard enough to break skin with her fingernails, and bite me hard enough to leave bruises and I didn't like it.

She never was verbally abusive too much, or at least outside anything I'd consider normal but when I told her she had to quit biting me and ""playfully punching me hard"" and she wouldn't, I left after a year....

When I tell this to a girl I'm seeing I've had some of them become irate, like scary angry, yelling at me that I must not be serious or that I didn't try hard enough. I've even been yelled at that I'm cheating on my ex despite being single for many years. Or they no longer want to see me cause I am not ""safe"" if I'm willing to leave someone.

It's demoralizing some of the dates I've been on since I returned to being single.",dating
1481,I have found that men my age no longer see me the same way? Is settling for a less attractive man my only option now?,"\[31f\]

Hi reddit, look I want to be as honest and as realistic as possible here. I want the best and most practical advice, so I am going to be as forthcoming and blunt as time as possible.

Background about myself, I am a White female, I work in supply chain management, I have a pretty good job. Looks wise, I am decent I am 5'6 at 136 pounds definitely not the fittest I can be but far from overweight. Looks wise I think I am above average. I do workout however, because of my work hours, lack of sleep, and other obligations I can't get good workouts in.

When I was younger I will honestly say I never had a hard time getting into a relationship with a man that I was attracted to. Yes, there was a few times I was burned where someone didn't return my affections but it was never a consistent problem or anything. My relationships often ended for different reasons sometimes I ended things sometimes the guy, sometimes mutual. In my social group, a lot of people would be required to move and relocate for work and that often would be the reason why relationships would end.

I guess, what I have noticed now, and not just myself, is that a lot of the guys I would go for, aren't really so much interested in women my age anymore. Peers/coworkers guys that I always saw on my similar level of dating attractiveness, now I see them pursue almost exclusively younger women. This isn't something that is just in my head, the directors/VP's people above me in the company almost all have wives 15 years younger than them and or have divorced the wife they had when they were younger. I feel like it is a ""thing.""

I feel like I am respected by male colleagues, however they don't see me as someone they would settle down with anymore. It is not that I am deprived of attention, I have gone on dates that definitely do want to pursue a relationship with me, however I am not really attracted to them. I have been on dates with guys that have similar goals to me, are smart, but the physical attraction element just isn't there. And I don't know what to do, I have tried to spend time with them more hoping that I would become more attracted to them but it just isn't there. That spark that attraction just doesn't trigger.

I am not sure what to do at this point. I want to settle down and have a family, I know that there is a biological clock with all of this but I don't know what to do. I am feeling like my two choices are either stay single or settle down with a guy I am not that attracted to but checks every other box. I would love to hear advice, preferrably from older redditors.",dating

They can never explain why and I told a man today that in the future if he wants a black woman to not say that and he told me to be more fun 🙃 Can someone enlighten me?

1486,Hard to find a bf,"Currently, I am in uni (just turned 20) and it may seem like there are so many people out there, but it just feels so hard. I am tall and pretty.

I often question myself if i’m pretty enough or interesting enough. Why don’t guys ever pursue me? 

I do swimming, am in a bunch of clubs, hang out w/ friends, but I just feel like it’s never enough. So it must be my personality, but I am also working on myself and I don’t know what to change anymore. I will admit I’m lame sometimes, but idk how to not be. 

Whenever i pursue guys, they end up ghosting or stringing me along so f that.

1488,Food for thought: Dating sites don't want you to find that special person,"I'm an older single male that would like to find a long term partner.  I also have a background in economics, and in data science (the industry of creating predictive models, AKA ""algorithms).   After several months on the two biggest sites, I observe them presenting me with lots of potential candidates, many of whom are just objectively not matches, and a few of which have been interestingly close, but ultimately not a fit.  

I have always tried to understand how an internet operation makes money off me, so that I understand whether they have my interests in mind, or some other party. 

A couple of nights ago I told a woman I had dated several times that I don't think we're right for each other.   I smoked a doobie and was ruminating on how this had happened.  

All of the sites charge a monthly fee for a full featured experience.  If you assume that all of the sites are run by smart, motivated people, you would conclude that they will use predictive models to be very targeted about to create connections that will MAXIMISE THEIR REVENUE. Their logical goal is keep you using the site as long as possible.  Quickly presenting you with a match that works leads to shorter term subscription choices, and termination of subscriptions.  Presenting you with interesting choices that ultimately don't work out would lead to you thinking the site was useful, and keep you engaged.  The profit maximizing behavior would be to present to people choices that are likely to connect, but not succeed in the long term. If a match is excellent, the sites are disincented to present you that choice.

I conclude that, if I were the CEO OF Match/POF, et al, that I would try to present people with matches that are close, but doomed to fail after a short period, because that would keep people paying subscriptions for as long as possible.  I assert that dating sites are incented to NOT present you candidates that are a likely long term fit.

1491,Can’t even get responses as an attractive woman (F25),"Take the title with a grain of salt. Just want to vent a little. I’m not otherworldly gorgeous but I’m self-aware and observant enough to know that I’m not unattractive. But my experience on dating apps (like Bumble) is terribly discouraging and affecting my self-esteem. I put effort into my profile and it’s unique, but not off-putting. Either convo’s reach a dead-end too soon from their end, or they make it sexual immediately, they just don’t respond, or they unmatch. Man, nothing hurts like thinking you’re having a good conversation with someone, only to get unmatched abruptly. 

Am I too old? Is it cause I’m of Middle Eastern descent? Should I be more stoic? In some of my pics I wear genuinely trendy and tight black dresses that depict the figure I work hard for. But they are by no means revealing. Barely have tits anyway. A guy I recently matched with asked me why I looked like a teacher in those pictures! Son, I just wear glasses. Wait maybe the glasses are the reason I have no success. Made him leave the classroom immediately, of course (unmatched).  

Anyway, here’s my experience as an “””attractive””” woman. Only person properly engaging with me at the moment is an exchange student. I’m sure he’s looking for a serious relationship…!!! Lord help me.

My life is already full, I don’t NEED anything or anyone to feel fulfilled. I want someone to share stories with, to learn with. I want someone to love with. Is that asking too much of someone?

He actually listened to me because he remembered everything I told him and he used to bring up stuff I told him in the past but I found out he never had feelings for me and just wanted to get in my pants. Basically he faked love and pretended that he wanted a relationship with me. While we were together, he was still on dating apps and cheating on me. 

When we broke up, he denied about everything and said he loved me but couldn’t control his sexual desires around me and that he couldn’t stay with me because I’m not a Muslim. He said I deserved someone better and he gave a lot of excuses to get rid of me (religion, family stress) that in the beginning he said it wasn’t an issue. Days ago, he was talking about marriage and kids. He wanted to remain friends but we don’t talk anymore. 

Why men do this? Isn’t easier to pay a sex worker than deceiving someone for months? They aren’t interested in serious relationship but lie to multiple women that they are, I wouldn’t have the energy to lie and pretend I’m someone else for months.

EDIT: A lot of people are assuming that we had sex. I’m a virgin and we never had sex. That’s the reason he left me.",dating

And what happened next I had never beleived would happen to me one day. She came close to me and I held her tight as she leaned in for kiss. Since it was my first time, it was a bit sloppy at some instances but overall i was slow and gentle. It ended with me teasing her a bit about her height :P to which she laughed and said you weren't a bad kisser though.

Edit: Just to let you know guys, i had a crush on this girl since i was in highschool, I'm currently a sophomore and it's been a few weeks since we have been dating.
More power to you guys, never give up <3",dating

1505,Bf wants to experience strip club,"I (20f) have been with my bf (20m) for a little over 2 years. I’m an extremely jealous gf due to past trauma and I’ve been trying to work on how I react to things but also my trust issues. It’s always been a boundary of mine that I just don’t want my bf going to a strip club/ watching porn/ stuff of that nature. He’s been okay with it but recently we got back on the topic of strip clubs and although he told me he’d never go to one he’s told me that he’d want to go only for the experience. It hurt to hear and I’m confused on how to feel. He’s always told me that he doesn’t find anyone else attractive, I mean he’s said he can point out a good looking person, but there’s a difference between finding people attractive and seeing someone who is good looking. Anyways I just don’t understand why me being naked isn’t good enough for his taste. Why does he want to go and experience a strip club, shouldn’t I be good enough for him like he says I am? 

TLDR: looking for advice! I don’t want to be selfish but I’m just confused! Bf says he would want to go to a strip club just for the experience",dating
1506,No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy,"No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy. I (24F) was seeing a guy (25M) for about 2 months. During the relationship, I could've given more to him, but it was a really busy time for me. However, when I was with him, I was very present. Anyways, things ended and it broke me in ways I didn't even see coming. I didn't realize how much I started to like him and when things ended abruptly, it sent me down a dark hole.

Things didn't end badly or anything. He just didn't like me and that's that. He was honestly such a good guy that there were no red flags or icks for me, which makes it so damn hard to move on. It's been months and I can't stop thinking about him. I miss him. I found out he's seeing someone now, so I know for sure that he's not even thinking about me. It just sucks how I feel so much for him, but I know he never felt that way about me. He is unbothered by this whole situation while I've been kind of at my lowest these past few months. I know 2 months wasn't a long time, but I don't know why I feel so much for him. I just want to let him go. Why does it have to be like this? I have done so much reflection on the whole situation and while I know the reasons why this is affecting me the way that it has, my heart still hurts and I'm exhausted.

TL;DR I was dating a guy for some time and he ended things. There were no hard feelings, he was just no longer interested in me. I do wish him the best, but it just sucks knowing that he's doing just fine without me while I'm over here struggling.

Update: I recognize that since it ended so early, it ended when things were in the honeymoon stage which is always hard because I'm mourning the potential. There's still a lot about him that I don't know, but I guess I never got to see things through and I wanted more time with him. I call him a good guy because he was a good guy. I didn't like him just because he was a good guy. I liked him for who he was. I wanted to continue to get to know him more and he didn't. I didn't think this post was going to blow up as much as it did, so thanks for the help!",dating

1508,Would You Date A Single Mom?,"Would you date a single Mom? 

My personal experience…I will never date a single Mom again. 
Reasons: baby daddy always will be there. That being said, baby daddy can sabotage the relationship in many ways. Also, if baby daddy was a scumbag and makes just the slightest of improvements, there’s always a risk of your girl going back to her child’s father, due to wanting her family unit together again. Also, finances…you’re having to spend money on her child (babysitters, food, schooling, etc.). If you do break up, you also break up with the child. That’s two people you bonded with that are no longer in your life. Can’t discipline the child. The child’s father is always going to have the final say. 

No offense to the single mom’s out there, but the imprint your child’s father left is damn near impossible to overcome, unless we have a child of our own and he continues to f*ck up.",dating

Edit to add: since everyone wants the tea 🤣 it was more than him not knowing what I wanted. I wanted to use a condom and he didn’t (even though he had 2 brand new boxes), he put one on and then complained that he went soft (he was soft from the jump), tried to get me to let him not wear one by saying he was “snipped” (like preventing pregnancy is the only reason to use condoms), and then the condom was gone… he fucking stealthed me….

1517,I’m sick of being played (36F).,"Dating is getting depressing AF. You can have the best time with someone. Have similar views and fun activities in common, and they switch within a few hours. I don't get it, and I don't understand why and I never will.",dating
1518,I respect the guys that outright tell me that they just want sex,"Honestly, why does the society have such a negative attitude towards men/women who just want sex? Personally, I’m not into hookups, sex without emotional attachments is just terrible for me. But just because i don’t like it doesn’t mean I’ll impose my ideas on others, nor should they on me. 

Often times on dating apps men, and probably women too, don’t say that what they’re looking for is a hookup. So they string someone along, hopefully tell them what they’re looking for on the first date, or worse, ghost them after the deed is done. But why? I haven’t seen a dating app from a guy’s point of view, but I’m sure there must be some women that are also looking for a hookup. Why not go to them instead of misleading and taking advantage of a woman who clearly says they’re looking for a long term relationship on their bio? And even if you don’t want to put the fact that you’re looking for a hookup in your bio, drop it somewhere in your messages before a first date. Stop wasting other people’s time. I have way more respect for a guy who is forthcoming about what they want, than the guy pretending to be a goody two shoes because he doesn’t want to be labeled a fuck boy. Let me tell you, there’s nothing wrong with being a fuck boy/girl so long as they admit that’s what they want to the people are with. If you tell a girl/guy that sex is all you want, then it’s on them if they want more than what you’re willing to give.

All I’m saying is we should stop treating people looking for hookups as these terrible people. This misconception behind fuck boys is hurting the dating world more than it’s helping. Wanting just sex is not a bad thing, and wanting a relationship isn’t either but both parties should feel comfortable with admitting that to themselves and their partners. 

Now, if you’re just a disgusting human being who takes pleasure in hurting men/women and taking advantage of them, then you belong in the deepest part of hell.",dating

1522,Why do men become cold and heartless after they break up with you.,"I was in a relationship with an army guy who was in the process of getting out. When I met him he brought it up and said he already made up his mind to stay here before I even came into his life. As times goes on, i realize that it will be helpful for him to at least see his family, even if he wants to stay at least he should go home visit and be around family for a while and I generally said that because he was under stress, he stopped hanging out with friends, he totally changed. I understand that in this world plans usually don’t go the way we want it. I even made it clear to him that I will be here to support him no matter what, so my question is was I wrong to tell him to go home or I was just blindsided by the person he was. He didn’t even said goodbye, he has blocked me, all of a sudden his mom doesn’t like me. So what exactly did I went wrong.

I just want to cuddle and talk wich we do but is it wrong for me to want as soon as we are together? For bit more context.

He’s even still posting on his insta stories. That aside, I realize we probably would have been official by now if he actually did like me. Last week he was also more distant than usual, then it went back to normal, and now this again. 

It’s the typical hot and cold situation isn’t it? I’m no idiot, I know that a ‘maybe’ is a ‘no’ and that I should move on. I’ll be too busy for the next few weeks to meet new people tho, so it’s gonna be even more difficult to get over this guy.

Once I got to college, I felt very insecure and behind socially that rather than putting myself out there to date or meet guys, I just focused on my education and career. I was also dealing with a lot of mental health issues and insecurities. As a result I didn’t date in undergrad and graduate school. 

Now I’m settled in Chicago. I have a great job, I’m doing well financially and my confidence is better. I think I’m pretty attractive. I used to not think that about myself. I’m finally at a place where I’m looking for a serious relationship. I recently started seeing this guy. I have told him that I’m inexperienced but I still feel very insecure about it.

I spent this past weekend with him and his family at his house where he grew up. The next day I found out he’s on tinder. We met on tinder 4 months ago, and now his profile is completely different with a new bio, and very recent photos. I immediately called him and recited his new tinder bio to him. He seemed panicked and started trying to make excuses, said he didn’t meet anyone on there and was just fucking around blah blah. I was so mad I hung up on him. I tried to call him later multiple times cuz I had more questions and I was so hurt. He never picked up and now I haven’t heard anything from him since that call. I don’t understand. Why be telling me he wants to be exclusive and choosing to stay and spend time with me and invite me to come spend time with him and his family just to be doing that behind my back and then not even have the decency to pick up my calls after? I am unbelievably hurt and shocked, I really never expected this from him.",dating
1528,My opinion on what is wrong with “dating” nowadays,"This post is just my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own but with that being said I think a major problem with “dating” nowadays is there are so many labels on things. 

Some examples I see just on this sub:

“We are just “talking” so I can see whoever and sleep with whoever I want” 

“We are in an “open relationship” where we’re in a relationship but sleep with other people. (one person in that situation always ends up feeling alone)

“We are “FWB” and it’s not working out, why is that?” 

“We are just “casually dating” and can still sleep around while seeing each other” 

“We are in a “situationship”, where you do relationship-like things without “being in a relationship” 

Was dating like this many years ago, (when our parents/grandparents were growing up?) I’m sorry but I’m going to bet, NO. 

What has changed in society? 

It because many people do relationships backwards where “sex is first” and if the sex is good then you start “dating”, if not you leave? 
Is it because everything is sexualized and sex is viewed as something “less special” nowadays? 
Is it because people watch too many xxx movies and want to emulate it? 
Who knows..

If someone needs to “sleep around” and “casually date you”, then in my opinion, they aren’t even that serious about you and you deserve better. I think you are either in a relationship and going to see each other through good and bad times or you’re not.

Maybe I’m just old-fashioned but whatever happened to asking someone out, being boyfriend/girlfriend, and trying to make it work with one person? 

I don’t know, maybe I’m just old-school. Just my opinion. What’s yours?",dating

edit: did not expect this to get the amount of attention as it did so let’s clear things up

1) I am referring to the date with her as the “bag to secure,” not her. Did not mean to offend anyone by that

However, all of his social media doesn’t say that once i added him. Tbh I think he was just weird.

I just think sometimes in dating you have to use your own best judgment since you actually know the person.

Edit: to clarify, people on Reddit were making fun of me for talking to him like he wasn’t taking me seriously and definitely has a girlfriend or wife back at home and he’s a walking red flag. It just added to my anxiety to dump him when there was no proof.",dating

She starts touching me and kissing me all the way back to her place. This is the girl of my dreams in terms of looks and and I am so happy

When we are in bed we do the usual stuff and then unfortunately I cum in about 30 seconds. Then I finger her for a while after. We cuddle and then fall asleep. 

I then text her the next day saying” I had a great time, do u want to do something next week?”. She then blocks me from all social media.

Maybe the sex was bad. Sure I didn’t last long. Or maybe she was weirded out by the fact I only had one testicle. Bet your weren’t expecting that curveBALL. Obviously she was attracted to me enough to have sex so what was the issue?

Edit: I should mention that there was so many red flags that I overlooked just to hit. For example she said she only dates guys over 6’2. And her bio had something alluding to she wants a man that will pay for drinks and stuff .

She also invited me over within 10 minutes of chatting on tinder

I can understand a greeting there. I’ve had many cases where I don’t send a greeting, then next time I text whoever I’m dating, she’ll have an attitude, and ask where I’ve been. It usually comes from women I have to initiate conversation with, which makes it more annoying.

1538,You need a strong sense of self before a relationship,"I know a lot of people hate to hear the advice of first you need to work on yourself - but it is true. 

You need a strong sense of self before dating. Why? Well, you need to know and feel that if anything goes wrong, you have a comfortable, safe, strong place to return to and that is your own self. This is power and people are attracted to power. If they want to leave, if they are not sure, if they found someone else - it is irrelevant to you because you know where you'll return and you love it. You'll want to make it easier for them to leave. You'll open the door for them to get out as you know for sure you are standing on a rock. It is not a ultimatum, a threat, a bravado - it is genuine and people can feel it.

I see so many scenarios of ghosting, people stopped being pursued out of nowhere, inconsistency, cheating, lies, manipulation, confusion. You need to have spent a good amount of time in your own personal space which is ideally a safe, protective, fun, comfortable space that when you notice any of these behaviours you can easily detach and say ""no, that behaviour is not familiar to me, I don't want that in my life.""

It takes time, effort, tears - but I finally got there and I feel so empowered.",dating
1539,Women with male roommates and men with female roommates… red or green flag?,"My personal opinion is that it is a BIG green flag!

I lived with one of my guy friends for 4 months and his girlfriend has always said it was a major green flag that I felt so comfortable with him sharing my living space.

But I was talking to my sister about this and she said she would never date a guy who lived with women, because she would be worried about cheating/jealousy in general. For context, the guy I’m seeing has 3 roommates, all women, and I am going to be meeting them this weekend.

From a females perspective, I’ve been dating for a while and I’ve never had someone reach out again after. Despite always ending on good terms.

1542,"I guess there will always be better choices than me, as long as I'm overweight","I (26f) was at a bar, flirting with this guy I had just met. We were having a great conversation, some light shoulder / knee touches, eye contact, all the good stuff.

Then in walks a friend, and she comes and sits right next to him. Obviously oblivious to what was going on. She says hi to me, then to him. 

She is a very skinny and conventionally attractive woman. No denying it. I am curvy. I am not pointing this out to disparage skinnier body types. I think they're attractive, too. But I can't help but feel this is an important detail.

Within minutes, the guy is straight up ignoring me. They hit it off and I'm clearly not his focus of attention anymore. She is now basically playing footsies with him and leaning on him. I excuse myself from the situation, and about an hour later I see them leave together.

I'm not mad at her, at all. She had no idea we were flirting. It's just a huge blow to my self esteem. I was a fine choice for the man, he seemed super into me, until someone hotter came along. 

I know being physically fit is important. I'm healthy, just curvy. I love my body but it's pretty clear that I'm always going to be second or third choice, as long as a skinner girl is in the room. It's not like my personality isn't there, I know I am a cool, chill woman and get along with everyone. I'm just tired of connecting with a man just for him to go GaGa over my skinny friend.",dating
1543,What to expect after first date sex?,"I need some advice.
The universe has pretty much given me a solid middle finger in my dating life for way too long and I could really use a break.

What to expect after first date sex?

So, I had a fantastic first date last night with a guy that I have been talking with over the past month. We hit it off, so we continued the date to another bar, then back to his place to share some music and bodily fluids.

So much good vibes, chemistry, a ton in common, amazing personality, and it feels like he could be a really good fit for me long term. The personality matchup felt so natural.

Yeah it's just the first date and people gradually reveal who they really are over time. But, my gut is saying this guy is solid. My gut has always been on point, regardless if I listened to it or not.

So, we both had a lot to drink. I stayed the night at his place. We made out, fell asleep, then woke up, fooled around and had sex, fell asleep, snuggled lots, woke up and had even better sex. *Chef's kiss* (Eye contact and mega good feels.) it's  about time I was properly fked.
Then, I had to go home because his daughter was getting dropped off.

Okay, so here's where I am a bit stuck
What are next steps? Is there a secret cheat code or book out there to help me through this dating phase. I am just lost. I am great in a relationship. But, the dating phase is wayyyyy more complicated than it needs to be.",dating
1544,How to properly compliment nudes?,"I haven't had many girls/women send me their nudes and the only time(s) it has happened, it has happened w girls/women I have talked with, on the internet, without any such real connection. But rn with this person I am talking to, there has been an instant spark and chemistry and she is sexually very vocal and expressive and thus chose to send me her nudes. So now I really wanted to know that how should I actually compliment them as she is godly beautiful- what exact words or things should I say or should I not say in order to let her know how beautiful she is and maintain the nuaghty vibe without making things awkward.",dating
1545,Cute names to call a guy?,"I’ve always struggled with this one cuz I personally am not a fan of babe but I am seeing someone new and he calls me sweetheart and I want to say something cute back to him (good morning texts) but feel like I’m gonna put my foot in my mouth.

1546,Did something today that I've never done before...,"Whenever I see a cute girl in public whether it be at a Target or at a restaurant or somewhere else I never say anything. I've always felt that most girls today either view a random guy talking to them as being creepy or as a form of harassment. It's not that I've never talked to random girls in person before it's just that I've never been like oh there's a cute girl in line at a Dunkin' let me go talk to her. I feel like talking to someone at a bar vs. the Dunkin' line is two very different things.

Well today I changed that. I was waiting in line at a sandwich shop and this girl in front of me didn't notice that she dropped a dollar. So, I bent over and gave it back to her. She was very appreciative and gave me a smile. As I waited for my sandwich I was just thinking to myself I should talk to this girl. There's no reason for me not to other than me getting in the way of myself talking to her. Anyways, she was sitting by herself eating her sandwich so I sat at the table next to her. I turned over to her and asked her how her sandwich was and we actually had a decent conversation. What started with us talking about sandwiches then went to us talking about other topics. Long story short, I ended up asking her out and she said no. Apparently she has a boyfriend but honestly I don't care that she said no. It felt so good to just talk to this random girl. We had a good convo and she was pretty engaging as well.  

Now you might be wondering why are you making a post about a girl rejecting you and you're happy about it? It honestly felt so good to get out of my comfort zone and I've seen people on here talk about how they feel like they can't approach a random girl in public for a variety of reasons. What I learned from today is just stop and don't even think. Just do it. Of course, there's certain situations where I'd say it's not appropriate to approach a random girl but if the situation is right just do it. You don't need a complex opener, just say something simple. Like hey I like your shoes or hey have you been to this coffee shop before? I didn't think today and like I said it felt so good. I felt like I was on Cloud 9 after the fact and she didn't even say yes. 

TLDR: Don't overthink it when you see someone you like. Just shut your brain off and have a normal conversation like it's any other person.",dating
1547,The pandemic came at a time when a lot of us were at our dating prime,"Anyone who is single right now and has been for the last 4 years, I just want to say the pandemic put us at a huge disadvantage and this is not acknowledged enough. 

It felt like survival and just being able to see our loved ones were important for 1-2 years. Who could blame us for putting dating or meeting new people on the back burner? And even if we wanted to, social situations were so limited. 

It was a bummer for me seeing the surge of weddings that came out of it, while I was still in the same place.

I’m in my late twenties and I’m young but it doesn’t mean that I still don’t feel somewhat behind or robbed of my mid-20s.",dating
1548,Age old question for the men: Does a bit of hair down there bother you? Be honest.,"So most of us women who shave understand that you have one, maybe two days tops where the shave stays fresh down there. After that a 5 o clock prickly shadow situation starts occurring and it is very painful to shave it.

Is this a big deal to you guys? Should I not have sex if that is my ""situation"" down there? I am very insecure about hair and never have sex if there is any remote sign of hair regrowth and I don't know if that's ridiculous.",dating
1549,When did exclusivity even become a thing with dating??,"Okay, I feel like when I was in college, the “exclusivity talk” wasn’t a thing.

Asking because the whole concept of exclusivity just ruined things with a dude I really liked

Edit: I wanted to add here that we did have this conversation before feelings became too strong and we found out we were on different pages, so I ended things. I didn’t come here seeking advice about my situation. More a commentary on the dating world in general. I just recently started OLD too, so maybe that’s why I’ve never had this conversation before.

1551,"If you're looking for genuine desire in dating, dump those who date multiple people","Just my controversial opinion about dating. If someone is dating multiple people after a few dates with you, it's not worth pursuing a relationship with them later on. A person's values comes a long way with how they treat you. Be the first prize and treat them as the first prize. This is the only way to avoid cheating later on and prevent going into a relationship with people who settle with you.",dating

They are a confidence killer but at the same time I can’t delete them because that’s my only lifeline to dating. I check them once a week and it’s so discouraging that I don’t get many matches.

1554,I'm basically a place holder boyfriend.. it hurts but I don't want to let go,"I feel like I'm in love with a girl I live with.

However we cuddle almost every day in her bed, I gave her a back massage before, unclipped her bra and everything so I had a bare back to work with and she gave me one too. 

I take care of her because my instincts are just so strong to look after her and I hate it because I feel like I'm being used to give all the boyfriend benefits while she waits for someone hotter than me to take my spot and then gets to fuck her too. I feel pathetic because of it. 

But at the same time I also don't want to let go of these cuddle sessions we have because I love holding her and being held by her. I love having my need for physical touch fulfilled particularly from her of all people.

She is not dating anyone herself right now. He talks about her a lot. Thoughts?

Edit: I did bring this issue up to him. He was good about it actually and said he could try to take a step back from her, but we didn’t agree on what that would look like. I feel weird bringing it up all the time to check in on if he has changed anything with her and am wondering if time will tell. But in the meantime hoping for some advice as it’s really on my mind.

1562,Girls stop waiting and ask him out already,"For the longest time it was ingrained in me that men need to make the first approach. And for the longest time I was single for that reason. It’s not that men didn’t wanna ask me out. It’s because they have absolutely no idea what I wanted from them!

I missed so many opportunities to date guys I wanted just cause I waited around hoping they’d say something. 


So you know what I did? I stopped caring and started to ask them out! And you know what? I havent not been on the date with said guy! (Of course I’m not saying they won’t say no but I’ve asked out 3 and they said yes haha)

1563,Girl cancelled a date because I don't drink - is drinking this important to anyone here? I want to hear from you.,"I'm male, I received a message from a girl on a dating app. The conversation went well, she seemed nice and normal.

Her profile stated, I don't send pictures, so don't ask, I don't have any pics of my butt, this, that, and she also wrote in the profile: What am I looking for? A relationship. If you don't like it, move along.

So we talked for a few days and then I asked her out for a walk. She said she's up for it, but even if I ask her out for a walk it usually turns into a drink. A few days later, we're arranging the details of the meet, she asks me where do I live and with whom and also casually asked where I'd be taking her and what do I drink, that I strike her as the beer type like her.

I tell her I don't drink, but sitting down for a drink with her is fine (I can have tea), and told her I live outside the city in a nearby town.

To this she says that she can't be with a non-drinker and since I live far away and going to my place is not an option, she's sorry, but it doesn't sound like her kind of date. So I ask why is drinking so important to her and can't we go to her place. To which she says something unclear about being on a different wavelength and that she doesn't bring strange men home.

I was just flabbergasted by this. a) Why would drinking be this important to someone? I don't ask this in an accusatory way, I'm hoping someone here feels the same way as this girl and can explain it to me, because I'm just genuinely curious. Mind you, she is 42, so she's presumably not partying and going out every weekend so that she would need a bf who can keep up with the partying.

And b) everything in her profile said I'm here for a relationship, not hookups and then she wants to go to my place on date #1, and she says she doesn't bring strange men home, but she's willing to go to a strange man's home??? She didn't say anything about kids or roommates or anything that would explain why she doesn't want to bring someone home.",dating
1564,"People that got into a great physical shape, do you ever get repulsed by others wanting you ""just for the looks"" afterwards?","Funny enough, when I was younger (early 20s) I was in a great shape and really didn't mind getting hit on just because of that, rarely that has been some sort of chemistry from my end and most of this lead to one time casual hookups type of deal.

I got in a really bad place later in 20s and put on great amount of fat, yet was able to attract current crush that simply liked me just for me in spite of being in terrible shape and not even accepting myself at that point.   
  
Now I got back into a shape where I would get compliments on a daily basis or get approached randomly without even initiating anything, yet for some reason, even thought this is something I have had probably wished for while being in bad shape, it does not bring me anticipated joy and would much rather prefer compliments on a personality traits as oppose to just body.

I’ve been seeing someone for the past year (26f) (30m), we’ve been talking marriage, kids & a future. However, I just found out today he had sex with someone just 2 weeks ago.  We’re not in a relationship but we established we were exclusively dating. 

He’s my 2nd sexual partner. I’m just now (or was) at the point of getting really vulnerable & putting my all into him. Just to find out while actively “pursuing” me, he decided to have sex with someone random. To make it worse, I was in the area at that time & had plans to see him but instead he chose to do that. Now he’s going on and on about how bad he feels, how sad he is, how it was an ego thing, blah blah blah.

I just need words of encouragement. I’m really torn because we technically aren’t in a relationship but we were operating in every aspect & way of a relationship. We talk all the time, always hang out, always talk goals, have a good time just to find out this. I’m heartbroken.

1570,I'm debt-free and the person I've started seeing has 70k in student loans. Is having debt a fair deal breaker or do I need a reality check?,"We've just started dating as of a few weeks ago, and the topic of college came up. I graduated without having any debt, while he has about 70k in student loans from his undergrad, and intends to go to graduate school in the next couple years.

He is diligent about his monthly payments and is on track for a 30 year payment plan, but I'm worried about the idea of getting more serious in the future with this debt looming in the background, especially if he takes out even more money for grad school, a mortgage, car payments, etc. Is 70k a lot, or is this pretty standard? I've been very fortunate in life so I welcome some perspective on this.

Since I'm debt-free, I have plans for what I'd like to do with the money I've saved up since graduating; eventually I'd like to be a homeowner, pay for my own grad school education, etc. I know many couples choose to combine finances, and my own parents jointly paid down my mom's student loans after getting married, albeit it was only about $10,000...I feel like if I'm expected to contribute to pay down his loans in the future, it might hinder my own financial goals that I've worked hard for, and I don't want to grow resentment over it. And even if I'm not expected to help, if we lived together I worry that I would have to adjust to living a frugal lifestyle for his benefit. If his debt was more manageable, and that payment plan was 10 years, I might be less worried...

It's quite early on to be concerned about this, but for long-term relationship potential, is it fair for this to be a deal breaker, or is 70k a reasonable amount that shouldn't concern me?",dating
1571,I (19F) feel like my bf (21M) is pushing me to give him a bj.,"I really need some advice.
For context: I am 19F ,he is 21M.We’ve been together for almost a year.

I am very inexperienced with bj’s and I have a little piece of metal attached to my lower teeth,because I had braces,I need to keep them on until my dentist says it can be taken off. I tried giving bj to my ex.It was horrible,I had no idea how to do it,I was trying not to hurt his penis with my teeth and with that metal attachment,then,he grabbed my head and pushed it down.I almost vomited.Then he started complaining how awful it was.I felt really embarrassed and humiliated.Since then,I’m scared of bj’s.

I explained this to my bf a lot of times.That it’s not his fault,that I love him and I wish to give him bj’s,but I’m scared and I need some time to “get ready”.He often goes down on me,and I give him handjobs whenever he asks. He always told me that there’s nothing to be afraid of,that he’s different and would not push my head down,that he would guide me.I agree with this,I know that I need to get out of my comfort zone,which I did for him a lot of times,and sex got better.But this one is different.It’s really hard for me.

Last year,around October-November,I can’t remember,we had our first argument about this.He told me the only thing that was better with his ex was bj’s because she actually gave him bj’s.That hurt like hell.We argued for a whole day after this.He kept telling me that he didn’t mean it that way,that it’s not offensive bla bla bla then,after a whole day of arguing and me crying,he admitted that he was just trying to “motivate “ me to give him a bj.I almost broke up with him.I still didn’t forgave him that,and it kind of made me hate more bj’s.

We talked about this a few more times.Kind of asked for it while giving him handjobs,I explained it to him every time again and again.

We live kinda far away from each other,so we meet on the weekends.I need to study for my upcoming exams ,so I can’t visit him,but he visits me every weekend.He doesn’t study,he works.I visited him on his birthday in February,met his family,everything was okay.

So,today,because I’m on my period,we didn’t have sex,I gave him a handjob.

Last weekend he told me that he reallyyyyy wants to get a bj.I felt like I was ready,so I said okay.But,when he arrived to my place yesterday,I got really scared again.So I told him to wait.I tried kissing his manhood,but I just couldn’t do it.I felt the pressure on me all weekend.So I didn’t do it.Now,while he’s going home,he texted me that he doesn’t understand why I am so scared.This made me really angry.We had this conversation a lot of times.I can’t help it,and I especially can’t do it while feeling pressure on myself.

I tried explaining this to him again,he kept saying “who told you that this is a problem?” , “You can just say no,and I won’t bring it up”. If it’s not a problem, then why is he bringing it up so much? I said no ,he always looked disappointed and sad.I had enough and told him,that if it’s a really big problem to him ,that I can’t give him a bj yet,then he can go to look for someone else. His response was “yea you don’t even love me”. I did everything for him I could,i got out of my comfort zone for him,he was my number one priority and I put my studies aside for him.I always gave him gifts,compliments all day,always tried to make him happy.The fact that he tells me that I don’t love him hurts like hell.

I don’t even know anymore if I am in the wrong or not. What am I doing wrong? Am I the asshole in this this situation? What should I do? What should I tell him? I afraid to talk about this,arguing with him can be hell.  I really need some advice,since I don’t really want to talk about this with anyone I know.

1573,Is it rude to leave after sex?,"I always leave 10 or so minutes after sex. Whenever I go on a date and end up hooking up afterwards I end up leaving after sex since I don’t want to overstay my welcome. Most people like to sleep alone in their bed and have different sleeping habits, which can be a nuisance to others. 

I dated one guy and he kept on inviting me over to his place. Finally went over to his place after the 5th date. I had previously mentioned to him that I didn’t go over guys places when I barely knew them and he said nothing would happen (always knew that going over implied sex would take place). We had sex then and I stayed over since there was a snowstorm. Never heard back from him and then he told me he felt odd about things and he never expected me to stay over, just thought I was going to visit and didn’t think we were going to have sex. Ever since then I have left guys homes right after having sex.

I’m trying to take things day by day. I don’t believe I’ll really ever be in a relationship and at this point loneliness due to lack of companionship will be something I’ll have to deal with. 

Interested in hearing how other people deal with similar feelings

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond, or even just stick around to read the responses. Didn’t think there would be this my many replies.

I want to say a couple of things:

1. Each and every one of you is valid in your loneliness. You are valid and so is your loneliness.


2. Two things can be true at once: you can love yourself while also still desire companionship. Specially if you’ve never been on a romantic relationship before.

3. Likewise, in your doing the things you enjoy alone, part of the loneliness is wanting to share that enjoyment with a special someone.

1580,"What is this ""being friends first"" thing all about?","Recently I was wondering what exactly this means, or what they actually expect when writing this.

Let me give you some further details about my thoughts.
I experienced this in different ways.

1. While dating some woman told me they want to be friends first. I think this is pretty clear and was already often discussed here. This is just a kind way of saying there is not interest.

2. Straight written on an OLD profile like ""LTR but being friends first"", or directly written with in the first messages.
And here is where I started wondering.
I know that there is a thing that this should make clear that the woman does not want ONS.
That's absolutely fine with me, I myself am also not looking for that, but I'm definitely looking for a LTR.

But I ""don't want"" to be just friends first. I just have not the time for being friend's first -> with the option of maybe then getting into a relationship (if in the meantime there is no better option). I already have enough friends (which I won't neglect just for a CHANCE of a relationship) and a job which fills the days and WE pretty good.

Ofc I know that a relationship must include a friendship and I'm absolutely willing to invest in that if it's clear upfront that the goal of all this is a LTR.
But this seems to be not goal of these statements, at least in what I experienced so far.

Unless someone has nothing else to do, it will be difficult being friends with multiple matches just for the opportunity of a LTR (at least if we are talking about real friendship and not just talking now and then).

So what exactly are you looking for? Or how do you handle profiles/matches with that? Do I have wrong expectations?

EDIT: because this came up a couple of times. I am really for getting to know the person of interest a couple of month before finally deciding about a LTR.
But to me getting a friend takes longer than that -> That's what I meant with i have not time for being friends.

THANK YOU for all the opinions and comments! It gave me a nice insight about what this phase is and what it could mean. 🙂",dating

1583,I(29F) was told that I am a disgrace for dating outside of my race.,"I am a black woman dating an Asian man. Just this morning I posted a picture of me with my boyfriend on my Facebook account. 

A few minutes after I posted the picture I received a comment from a black man who was on my friendlist(until I blocked him) making rude remarks about my relationship saying that my boyfriend will never marry me and that he is only with me for fun and that I am a traitor to my black community. Let me not forget to mention that this was coming from a man who is in a relationship with a white woman.....

1584,"Is it a red flag if a girl has a strong, unintentional racial preference when it comes to dating?","I can find people of all ethnicities attractive, but for dating and relationships I always end up completely in love with Asian men. 

I’m unsure why since I am not Asian. I am not into their media either. So I can’t really pinpoint where this strong preference came from. But from what I’ve seen, some are unworldly attractive and I guess also the stereotypes about being successful men. When I see local men, I can think they are cute, but bland. 

My concern is my previous partners have all been that ethnicity. I don’t do the pursuing, but I found them to be the best fit for me as individuals. Looks definitely play into it of course.

Would it be a red flag for both non-Asian men and Asian men? How can I open up to dating other people?",dating

I’ve had one serious boyfriend for 2 years a few years back and since then I’ve had small flings and been on soooo many dates this year but every time something is going well, I get cheated on or he ghosts me or he moves overseas…you get the idea.

I know 28 isn’t that old but it’s just hard when everyone around you is settling down and you would love to as well but it’s like I’m just having the worst luck, at what point do you just give up?

1588,No kiss after 2 months,"*** UPDATE as requested 😌

Super nice guy, slightly quirky….had once said that if he gets physical too soon he loses interest. So i respected that…But really, no kiss after 2 months? Red flag? Is this really a thing or do you think he just isn’t into girls?

—————————

So I came back from a Miami girl trip, and was super excited to see him that following weekend. I figured we’d finally have “the chat” and I would get a kiss! Lol. Well it didn’t even get there. He didn’t show interest in seeing me and mentioned his plans. Well that was a major bummer and very telling to me. So I mentioned that I would have liked to have spent time with him that weekend and I also mentioned that I was starting to feel more like just a concert buddy lol. Well after several hours, he told me he was putting dating on hold and tending to his parents’ care. (Yes they’d been sick, as is mine, so we also had that in common). Well I told him thank you for your honesty and to take care. He texted me , you too”….. 
I followed up that with a few more texts checking in on him and his parents and also asked if and when he was ready to date, would he consider me again? Well he’s completely ignoring me. Complete radio silence. I’ve essentially been 👻 

I regret not having the discussion face to face but I think he felt more comfortable texting. And that’s okay. We are different people on different pages. He’s definitely looking for something platonic and I’m looking for romance. 

I’ve learned from this that
 a) the 2 mos w/o kiss is not normal for ME 
B) to communicate respectfully early my needs in a relationship
C) the Reddit family is awesome and has great insight 

Thank you all for your input and advice :)

1590,The wait staff at a restaurant helped me dodge a bullet tonight,"So, I went on the worst date tonight. I ignored some yellow flags and agreed to meet up with this guy who kept me waiting for an hour. Initially he told me he was going to be 17 minutes later, then he was parking, then he was stuck in a line of cars, then he was walking from a few blocks away and before I knew it an hour had passed.

I drove 40 mins, navigated the same parking issues and event traffic as him and I was on time.  He was 20 mins away and still managed to be an hour late. When he finally arrived, I was in the restroom. He called and texted me, but I was occupied.  Instead of waiting for me to respond. He walks around the restaurant for two minutes and then leaves.  

I came out of the restroom  to see the missed calls and texts and call him back and he’s like ‘I’m headed back to my car. I’ll come back’. Then the hostess interrupts me and asked if I was waiting for a date. I said ‘Yes, he’s on the phone.  Thank you!’ and instead of saying ‘Ok, good’ and walking away, she waits until I get off the phone to say something. 

Turns out he came in, did a lap, was douchey to the waitstaff when they said they hadn’t seen me and then said “Oh well, I’ll just find someone better” and then left!  After I waited for him for an hour. 

Two other waitstaff stopped me and were like ‘Were you waiting for a date? That guy was a douchebag!’ When I confronted him in person, he was apologetic for being late and for leaving, but lied about saying that. As I’m walking away another waiter had overheard the conversation and was like ‘wow, what a jerk’.

So, thanks guys for telling me because I probably would have tried to be nice and continued the date. Lessons learned, always follow your instincts.",dating
1591,Co worker and I hooked up,"Coworker(26f) and I(21m) hooked up last night after getting drunk at the place we work at. We always had a weird tension and finally acted on it. I’m not looking for a relationship rn and I don’t think she is either. 

The problem is that she didn’t show up to work today and I don’t know what I should do. Should I reach out and message her about what happened and where we’re at with each other? I know things are gonna be awkward now for us and I’m probably going to regret doing it. I just don’t know what I should say to her. The sex was pretty good I’d say but neither of us finished because we were so drunk. She took me home from her house in the morning and we didn’t really say much on the ride home. What should I do?


Update!- We spoke today when she was leaving and I was coming in. Didn’t seem that awkward at all in fact we casually talked about work like normal. She left after her shift and everything seems fine. Hopefully everything is cool and nothing blows up at the work party at the end of the month when we’ll inevitably get drunk again!

The guy whom I found gently caring and funny and handsome. The first two dates were just amazing and full of laughter. I was really *really* looking forward to this one.

We were supposed to see each other at 8 pm and only two hours later, I realized he would not turn up. I got a little furious at first as I waited for more than two hours (was too excited and late to realize 2 hrs had already passed). 

I tried my best to stay calm and nurtured myself to have the dignity necessary to not feel hurt, as I hardly know him. But I was (and still am) curious to know what happened, so I texted him ""Hey I called you several times, but your phone isn't reachable. All good?"" but I never got a response from him.

My best friend stalked him on his socials - I definitely knew she might do this and warned her not to bother but she still did it lol.

She said he recently posted pics of him and some girl ""rock climbing"". Later on, I found out that he blocked me which is why I couldn't see his latest or any of his posts on my feed.

Honestly though? It hurt cause it had been a while since I went on a date and found someone who I think would accept me. I think I handled it like a champ and didn't let it seep through my mind.

1594,Am I the asshole?,"Just added the tip to the Uber ride I sent a date home on. It all fell apart when she showed up 75+ lbs bigger than the photos on her profile. We had exchanged phone numbers and had been talking for a month. When we finally met, I was flabbergasted. She had clearly misrepresented herself her photos had the be years old.
Uncomfortably, I explained her moral error to her face as I ordered her Uber home. She was in tears, but this isn’t the first time a woman has misrepresented herself on social media. She leaned on the fact that she was still the same woman on the inside. I made a comment on her not posting photos in her current physical condition and she burst further into tears.
I have no sympathy, I don’t feel for her at all.
My photos on dating sites are current and represent my current physical state.
She clearly lied to get the date… but why be upset when I called her on it. 
I insisted on ordering her Uber back home, which took an uncomfortable amount of time getting her address just to get her away from me.
I guess my point is don’t misrepresent yourself, than show up and expect everything to be cool. We’ve all got photos of us at our best, but it’s not ok to put that out into the world as what we currently look like. Also, it’s not the the first, third or fifth time this has happened with meeting women on dating sites.
I guess I was supposed to be moved by her tears, but honestly I just wanted her gone. Went as far as showing her the photos of herself she’d sent me. She still tried to make me feel like the bad guy. I give up.",dating

I feel like it’s just so unhealthy to consume so much sexualized images of women and I only follow guys I’ve known from school or grew up with. Never would I follow a man just because he has a six pack and I’d never like that kind of content.

1600,I broke it off with a guy who isn’t looking for anything serious. He still wants to keep in touch. Why?,"I broke it off with a guy who is not looking for anything serious but he still wants to keep in touch. Why?

I (21 F) met this guy (25 M) a few months ago at an event and was introduced by a mutual friend. We started talking and ran into one another a couple of times at other events.

He kept showing interest and he took the initiative to visit me in my city. I decided to explore things and we went out on a couple more dates. Since we live in different cities(an hour apart) we were meeting every 2 or 3 weeks. (Some of which where when I was in his city, as i have a big social circle there & visit often)
I made it clear don’t entertain men (long distance) who can’t come to my city to see me and keep up with it. 
I’m willing to reciprocate if he takes the lead.

He introduced me to his friends, it was all great and he started sending me Good morning texts and would FaceTime me every evening when I got home from work (consistently for 2 months). Started referring to me with endearing terms like (my love, babe e.t.c.)
I let him set the pace and I responded accordingly.
But I kept it light using words like (hun).

 Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I noticed consistency was shaky. He and I had developed a routine and it’s only natural for me to notice the change and wonder. I communicated my concerns and he told me he was getting worried I was having expectations of him that he wasn’t able to meet up with and doesn’t want me to resent him. I pushed the conversation further and he eventually came out with it that he wasn’t looking for anything serious but doesn’t want me to hate him and wants to have me in his life for a really long time. I’m not into situationships and I don’t care for low effort men so I ended things. 

He still tries to reach out like 3X in the week (via text and calls).  I don’t think he deserves the privilege to continue having access to my life. So I limit our interactions by not responding sometimes and when I do I keep it very short. 

Additionally, I communicated my sexual boundaries to him early on and he respected them. He said to me ‘sex is not my priority with you’ and things continued without fuss.
I’ve broken things off and we don’t interact face to face at all so there is no chance of sexual encounters plus we live 1 hour away from one another.
I wasn’t exclusively dating him as there were no commitments, so I wasn’t sitting around waiting for him to commit to me. I just think we’re not open to the same things so we don’t align.

Men, how small is too small for you to be a turn off? Is too much of a height difference something you're not into?

Edit: For people messaging me why this is a concern, this wasn't really a big concern but more of a curiosity. My last Bumble date told me that he had a very fun time but the height difference was a little bit of a concern. He mentioned that a foot height difference made it uncomfortable which I understand. But it did make me feel a tad bit insecure again. I did state my height in my bio, but I guess seeing it in real life wasn't it. (He wasn't rude about it so I'm fine with it).

1609,Is a girl off limits if your friend has been with her?,"Trying to get a male perspective. 

To clarify, I (31F) was never in a serious relationship with the friend (36M). We were friends with benefits for 3 months. It ended in August and he’s now back with his ex girlfriend. 

There’s a guy (32M) in his group of friends that I hang out with. He’s fine as hell and I’ve had my eyes on him for a while but have always thought he was never an option because he may know about me and his friend. 

That being said, I am wondering if guys would ever get with a girl their friend has hooked up with or should I just take it as a loss?

Edit: Thank you all for sharing your stories and perspectives on this. I couldn’t reply to everyone but all comments were very helpful! 

Overall, it’s not a one size fits all answer and is really based on individual preferences. Here’s a summary of what I gathered:

1. Absolutely off limits. It’s bro code.
2. No, I am a free agent, exes are fair game. 
3. It’s dependent on many factors:
     a) How close the “bros” are
     b) How long/serious the relationship was
     c) Whether or not there are any lingering feelings
     d) When the relationship ended 

Other things to note:
1. I may never be seen as dating material and only a hook up
2. The “bros” or group friendship(s) may suffer and it can potentially stir up some drama
3. I can/will be labeled as a “homie hopper”
4. Best approach is to be respectful and honest
5. There’s been both successful and unsuccessful outcomes to this scenario

Given that our FWB relationship was brief and there were no feelings attached and I wouldn’t consider them “best bros”, I’m going to go for it. Whether or not anything comes out of it is really going to depend on how he (new guy) feels about it (and obviously if he’s even interested/attracted to me). I am not ready to make my move just yet (want to hit the gym and get healthy for a couple months first) but once I feel confident, I’m going all in. Wish me luck!

Update 5/31/23: A couple weeks ago I ran into him (new guy) at the bar. We talked all night and after a few drinks (and confidence) in my system, I made a comment about me waiting for an invite as he spoke about leaving to hang out on his balcony. He looked at me (kind of surprised) and said “your ****’s girl”. Looks like he’s a loyal friend and is considering me off limits. It was a fail for me.

1610,Is it too clingy to want to be put first sometimes?,"In my last relationship my girlfriend put everything before me. Her job, her chores, her dogs, all came first, always, even though I was always willing to shift things around to make time for her. 

Not that I ever asked her to drop anything, but like, I would take days off work to go on dates with her when she was available, but she saved all her days off for vacations at the beach with friends. I would front load chores in the day or do them after dates to ensure we had time to talk, but she was often too busy to even reply to texts. Even when I came over to her house we would spend at least half the time playing with her dogs because she didn’t have time to exercise them earlier.

I get that life doesn’t stop happening and people need to put other stuff first sometimes, but I’d like to be in a relationship where \_I\_ can come first sometimes.

So like the title says, is that too clingy? Or is it a reasonable thing to want in a relationship?",dating
1611,This guy told me he was poly and had a gf on the 3rd date,"I went on a third date with a guy recently. Neither of the other two dates had been very serious, just short coffee/drink dates, but I thought he was nice and there might be potential. Then on this date he told me he is polyamorous and has a girlfriend.

I was really grossed out and I don't really have a filter, so I told him that's awful and asked him why he didn't say that on his profile. He claimed he did, but I pulled up his profile and it clearly did not state that anywhere. He then became incredibly offended and said I'm basically a bigot for not respecting and accepting those preferences with grace and love. I said it's manipulative and disgusting to take someone on a date without clearly stating that you have a girlfriend, and he argued that I didn't have to state that I'm monogamous, so why should he have to state that he was polyamorous?? And that it was some societal double standard?? Which I'm not sure about.

He texted me paragraph after paragraph about why I'm so terrible for my reaction, articles justifying why he would wait to ""come out"" as polyamorous, asking me to reconsider, etc. I blocked him, but I feel awful and so depressed about the entire thing and some of the bitter things he said to me in retaliation (""Oh, no wonder you're single if you act like this. I really thought you were a caring person. Good luck ever finding anyone with that attitude. Have fun being alone forever."" Etc.)

It just sucks and I can't stop thinking about it.",dating

You don't know those exes, you can't know if they're telling the truth about them and most of all, it means they're full of resentment and haven't gotten through that separation yet.

***A person who is genuinely interested in you will focus their attention on you and not on their exes.***

1614,My boyfriend won’t stay hard…,"My relationship with my boyfriend (29) has been a dream come true. It’s the healthiest and most loving relationship I’ve ever been in. The only problem… he goes soft during or at the start of sex. In the beginning sex was amazing. He went soft one time and it’s triggered for it to happen almost every time we are about to have sex. 

He states that his mind goes through a loop of “not going soft” when we start getting frisky and then it happens. He states he can’t break the loop because it just happens when he starts thinking of it happening again. He told me it’s not me and that he finds me attractive. He’s tried drinking plenty of water, working out, and relaxing his mind (which helps sometimes). He spoke to a doctor who recommended the same thing. 

I’ve been patient and understanding, trying not to add stress… as I know this is tough on him. I advised to take sex off the table for now until we can figure this out. 

From a male perspective, can anyone give me some insight or have experienced a similar situation?",dating

1616,"Girlfriend lied about sexual past, is this a big deal?","I met my girlfriend at work, we started talking and hanging out near constantly; the spark was there and we started dating around 2 months after we first hung out. Around three weeks into the relationship I brought up the fact we had not progressed sexually beyond just making out. I’ve had sex with around 5 different partners and I simply expressed that sex was something I valued in a relationship and I wanted to help make her feel more comfortable. She told me she’d never had sex with any of her past partners, and that she could be asexual. I said that I would not want to be in a sexless relationship but I cared about it her a lot and I would wait for a while to see if things worked out. Fast forward to a few weeks later and we’ve started having great sex daily. I thought it odd she told me she wasn’t particularly interested in sex given her current behaviour but didn’t bring it up with her except in a joking way. Fast forward another few months and we were talking about open relationships due to her friends current situation. She then mentioned that she was in an open relationship at 16 and slept with multiple people outside of said relationship. She also mentioned that they didn’t get along so well but the sex was good some she stayed. I struggled with this, not because of the sexual partners or the number, but the circumstances of the open relationship. I worry she will require more parters than just me given her history ( she stated she really enjoyed the open relationship). Additionally I feel the fact she posed as essentially a virgin is sort of a red flag. Again I do not care about the number of partners simply the circumstances and the dishonesty",dating
1617,"Men, do you ever regret losing someone who was good to you?","I recently have been reflecting back on a past relationship and wondering if they regret taking me for granted. I know I was really caring and supportive towards him. He would randomly tell me how my love was felt everyday. However, he had attachment issues and tended to self sabotage the relationship. A few days ago, a friend of mine was venting to me about how he screwed up with someone he liked and how he realized when she was gone, how much of a supportive person she was. And I guess I just want to know if this is a common thing? Or if anyone else has a similar story. We’re you just not ready for a good woman at the time? And what exactly made you regret it?

1618,"I went on the worst date imaginable, and he STILL married me!!","Many years ago (15) my bf took me out for a seafood dinner for Valentine’s Day. I have chronic stomach problems, which I was medicated for, but I wanted to have some cocktails to celebrate the occasion so I did not take it this evening.
We live in a very small town in Missouri, so to get to the restaurant we have to drive over an hour on a major interstate (I44). Towns and rest stops are few and far in between.
We had a beautiful dinner, very romantic with martinis (my fave). It was now nearing 8ish so we decided after dinner to start the hour long drive home. We drove about half way and it hit me like a Peterbuilt. I had to go number two. The way my stomach operates is; 1:I get the poop pains. 2: I have a “movement” within minutes. And tonight I did not take my meds. Oops. We were about at the halfway mark home. I started to sweat, to panic. I knew there was a rest area in about 3 miles. NOPE!!!!!! I had to tell him to pull over immediately, on the side of a major interstate. He pulls over, worried about me and as soon as the car stopped I jumped out and hiked up a small embankment, I trudged through the trees, and got all cut up. It’s freezing out, about 25f. There were no leaves on trees so I could see the road clearly. I Barely got my pants down before having the most awful watery diarrhea! Sadly, I tried my best but some got on me. After I was done spraying the hill I went back down to the car to see if I had a napkin or ANYTHING I could clean up with. I found one napkin. It wasn’t enough. I had made a mess because I was in such a hurry. The only item I could find to clean my hands up at all was a industrial size windshield washer fluid. I did my best with that and got back in the car in tears, mortified from embarrassment. I knew he had to smell it. We took off, windows down, made the rest of the drive. Got home, stripped, put my clothes in the washer and took a shower. 
I was so humiliated, but he felt terrible for me. I apologized. He says when you gotta go you gotta go. He assured me not to worry about it. He made me feel a bit better.
Anyways zip forward 15 years married with two kids. We are happy….. but now he is well familiar with my crazy digestive system… when my tummy hurts……… we stay home till it stops. Lol",dating
1619,Am I the only person who doesn't want to have sex with multiple people during my life?,"Am I the only person who just wants to have sex with one person in my life? I guess you can say I'm old fashioned when it comes to dating and sex. I view sex as such a special thing between two people and I honestly couldn't imagine doing it with multiple people during my life. I feel like I'm in the minority here though. Literally half the girls I see on dating apps are just looking for a quick hookup or a fwb situation.

Even among my friends, a lot of them are just talking about sex like it's nothing. As if it's just a handshake or something. I was talking to a friend recently and he told me that he and one of our female friends hooked up. Basically my friends went out as a group and they were drinking. As they all went home he and her took the same car home. He went to drop her off before walking to his house and literally hooked up on her stairs while her parents were sleeping in their bedroom. I was just like wtf. They kept hooking up for a while after that (even though he told her that he wanted to purse a relationship with her). Even some of the locations they hooked up in was wild to me. Then my other friend who was with me when he was telling us this says that he doesn't want to sleep with multiple girls and sometimes regrets losing his virginity to his ex. And then that same friend is talking about hooking up with these random girls he meets.

Back in like 2018 or 19 an old friend of mine got his first gf. And he was telling us about it and all. One of my friends (let's say B) asked are you guys sleeping together and he respond of course what would be the point of us dating then. Then B said that I don't want to immediately have sex with my gf. My old friend said why do you want to date then if you're not going to have sex with the girl? I responded telling him that I'm looking for an emotional connection and someone who I can spend my life with not a fuck buddy. His response was if you're looking for an emotional connection then just make a bunch of female friends and call it a day.

Like idk no hate if people want to sleep with multiple people cause you can do what you want to do but that's not what I'm looking for. I realize how hard it is to find someone who also views sex the same way that I do but I don't know I'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way as I do because it feels like no one does.

TLDR: Does anyone else want to only have sex with the person they'll end up marrying? In other words, does anyone not want to have multiple sexual partners during their life?",dating
1620,friends keep making fun of me for not getting girls,"They brag about it all day. 

They talk about how I'm a loser cause I don't really have anyone. I don't have any family and they are my only ""friends"" I've been alone my whole life. They make fun of me for knowing anything about anything. 

For example, I got a degree and am working on some certs too They always make fun of me for it and act like I'm not living life cause I want to learn things. If I bring up a fact about literally anything it's ""oh look he thinks he's smart, when really he's just a dumbass"" or they call me the R word. 

Women date them and have sex with them and today I was being made fun of for never being with a girl again, I got pissed this time and said it wasn't for lack of trying because I have had every dating app in existence and I just don't get matches, I've asked girls out IRL and am rejected every single time.

1622,Megafail,"Just thought I'd share a little story about an online brunch date, first and last meeting.   


It's Saturday morning, we meet for brunch at a cafe. She's wearing sunglasses and speaks extremely minimally, it's clear she's hungover, and seems to have attended out of obligation like arriving at work on a Monday morning regretfully. 

Initially I went in with an understanding mindset, and appreciated the effort to turn up at all. But it began to bother me when it went on like this the entire time, wearing the sunglasses and barely communicating at all. However she did eat a meal and enjoy a coffee, which I paid for and of course she made no attempt to pay. 

Here's the interesting part... She'd parked illegally at a different business across the road, and I'd parked down the street. So we parted ways right outside on the street and I walk to my car. Once I reach my car I receive a text message from the girl which was surprising. She sent the following complaint: ""Someone just crashed into my car in that carpark, CANT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME on this terrible date just to get my car wrecked. Don't bother contacting me again""",dating
1623,Is dating in your 30s impossible?,"I am a 32yo guy and it feels I will never be able to form a pure and loving relationship these days.

I had a 4years long relationship when i was 25 and at the time it seemed magic : it was very intense and we couldn’t spend a minute without each other. It was probably true pure love (at least for a while).

But nowdays i just feel super disillusioned about couples:

-people in their late 20s/early 30s have all had serious relationships by now and i feel i will never be able to create a « fresh » connection like when I was younger. There will always be comparisons with exes etc…especially if the split was a recent event

-all the failed relationships i had over the past 3years (cheating, arguments, people with too much emotional baggage…) make me unable to see value in being with someone for the long haul.. So i stick to hook-ups and fwb type interactions…

it’s a pity but i don’t know how to get out of that cycle…",dating
1624,The familiar love bombing patterns I’ve noticed from someone who is anxiously attached.,"I’ve had low self-esteem my entire life and have always, always been drawn towards narcissists and love bombers. I know I have an anxious attachment style and I am actively working on that (my parents were not around that much). 

I recently woke up and realised that I’m not going to find true love if I don’t start changing my ways and my attitude towards the men I am drawn to. I realized I can continue to blame these men, but I’m also allowing it to continuously happen by ignoring my gut and not listening to how they make ME feel… which, in hindsight, is usually not very good.

When we are desperate to find love, we will do anything to keep people around. We will overlook our own feelings and fixate on how to perform to make them like us or choose us. I have started changing my mindset from “but I really like them!” to “how did their behaviour make me feel?” and realizing that I don’t want to feel anxious, sick or bad about myself every day. (Note: if you’re feeling anxious about them not texting, or their on-off behavior, they are not right for you and your body is warning you about something.)
  
I started making notes of the six guys who ended up screwing me over badly the past couple of years and noticing VERY distinct patterns that I wanted to share. It’s almost text book. 

In my desperation of wanting to be “chosen” or wanted, I’ve continuously overlooked their bad behavior. These men are different ages, different races, different everything… but their behaviour is 99.9% the same. I’ve spoken to other women who’ve gone through it and they mention the exact same things. I wanted to share what I’ve noted in case it helps someone else.

1. These men are very complimentary and flattering at the beginning. They take you to fancy restaurants; buy you gifts; tell you about the trips/holidays you’re going to go on together (future fake); want to spend a lot of time with you. They tell you how beautiful you are or make ‘jokes’ or comments about having a family with you. Sometimes they will organize dates in quick succession - I‘ve had guys organize 3 in a week. It feels wonderful because you feel like someone wants you and sees you as a queen. Who doesn’t want to be adored, right?

2. They are quite touchy feely in the beginning, especially on first dates, and more than you’re perhaps comfortable with. It can be touching your arm to your leg, to holding your hand. They also push for sex very early on. I notice that I tend to feel uncomfortable with what they’re doing deep down, but I will tend to ignore it because it means “they like me”.

3. They always want to stay in touch with exes for some reason… and there tends to be a lot of them. They mention them on early dates as well.

4. Their texts or contact is very sporadic, which means you keep checking your phone to see if they’ve messaged you. It makes you anxious because you’re worried they will disappear.

5. As soon as they open up to you emotionally, tell you about their traumas or feel like they’re getting too close, they will either become very distant or cold with you, and/or simply disappear. I’ve had guys ghost me after sex, to other guy’s body language change right in front of you. If you confront them on their distance, they will continue to tell you what you want to hear: “Sorry, I’ve just been really busy”; “I really want to see you, I promise” etc. You end up obsessing because you hope it’s just a blip and that they’ll revert back to treating you wonderfully again. But usually they’ll just go silent, making you continually wonder what you’ve done wrong.

6. I notice that most of them have traumas or need therapy and will not get help. They also tend to have relationship issues with their mothers. (Btw - you know who else all have problems with their mothers? Narcissists.)

7. This whole process can happen within just a few weeks. It leaves you feeling confused and hurt, because they tend to discard you as soon as you feel things are going good. What did you do wrong? What did you say? Were you not good enough? 

I think this is hard for women predominantly because we’re conditioned to think that romantic gestures like these are a sign of love - i.e having your Cinderella moment. It feels very addictive. 

It also becomes harder dating men who don’t do do these things, because you don’t get the ‘high’ that comes with it. You start to question whether you do actually like someone, because you’re not getting that adrenaline hit in your heart.

The other thing I notice about love bombers is that THEY ALWAYS COME BACK - or at least orbit you, i.e keep tabs on what you’re doing on social media. They can do it for years. I don’t get it. When I’m done with someone, I don’t want to see what they’re doing or what they’re up to. Love bombers will keep you around and come back when they need attention. Your best bet is to mute or block them & not to reply. 

Finally, the no-contact rule is the only thing that helps me get over these people. Delete them from your socials and your phone, or even better, just block. I used to unfollow someone then check on them to see if they were still following me. It’s not healthy at all. They are like a drug you need to wean yourself off from.

Oh - one more thing. Even if you do follow them on socials or check up on them, you will notice that they never have successful or meaningful relationships. They don’t last very long. Not one of these men have gone on to being happy - not one. 

I am not over my anxious attachment style completely, but ever since I’ve started putting my needs before theirs, I’ve noticed I can get over these people a lot faster and see their behavior for what it is. We all deserve to be loved & it’s not our job to fix people who jump from relationship to relationship without healing their own traumas first. ♥️",dating

1627,Does being intimate with a woman make a man value her less if he hasn’t committed to her yet?,"I’ve (19F) been told by some of my male friends (19-23M) that once a man has “had a taste” of a woman, he starts valuing her less. I’ve personally never had sex because I’m saving myself for marriage but I have had foreplay with other partners. When I asked some of my male friends for advice, they said that I should withhold almost anything intimate until it’s been a long time and/or he’s committed to you because once you give him what he wants (sexually) he will have that power over you. Of course it sounds a little toxic to me that’s why I need a new perspective.

Although I’ve seen healthy long lived relationships, they’re mostly from older people. I’m in my early 20s right now and I feel like everyone around my age are just so immature and inconsiderate.

1631,I think dating apps are destroying the dating world.,"I'm really struggling with dating the last year and I read many times on here that people are in a similar situation. I have virtually no succes on dating apps, I get some matches, but barely any conversation and definitely no dates. I started going on speed dates as well, which I thought was going to work better because it isn't particularly cheap, you have to do the effort to actually show up, you meet people in person, so you get a first impression,...  But no, it's basically nothing better than online dating, except it's in real life. I get matches but that's about it, I text them asking to go on a date but I either don't get any reply, or they accept to go on a date but cancel last moment or something like that.  


I'm really starting to think that dating apps are to blame for all this behaviour. Because of dating apps people have too much choice and don't know who to pick anymore. It's like a seal swimming through a school of fish. If the person they're interacting with doesn't blow them away from the first moment they just move on to the next hoping that will be better, but they don't want to do any effort to actually get to know someone.",dating
1632,Was I the one in the wrong?,"So I (F 26) went on a third date with this guy (M 27) a few weeks ago and it went really well. After getting dinner and bar hopping, he asked if I wanted to come back to his place or go to mine. I felt a little pressured, but i agreed that he could come back to my place. Once we got back to my place, I was feeling nervous because I wasn’t sure that I wanted to do anything sexual so soon. 

We started to make out and then got on my bed (i live in a studio with no couch so the bed was really the only option) and continued making out. He pulled me on top of him and i grinded in him for a second or two (with our clothes on). He then proceeds to try pull off my bra and I stop him and mention that I really did not want to do anything sexual so soon. He then proceeds to get mad at me and tell me things like: “I haven’t had situation since freshman year of high school where a girl hadn’t gone past second base” and “I’m just trying to give you advice but don’t ever do this again” and he kept asking why I even “invited” him over. All in an extremely condescending tone. He excused me of blue balling him, etc. 

I think he sensed that I was upset and then pulled a total 180° and started being nice and cuddling me. All while I kept saying that I felt bad and basically apologizing. I didn’t really know what to do. So I offered to give him a blow job basically because he made me feel so guilty. The icing on the cake is, when I was while I was doing so, he called me another girls name… I’ve never felt so disrespected. 

Obviously things did not work out, but I am wondering if I was in the wrong here… was I leading him on or is he just extremely entitled? Me hesitantly agreeing for him to come to my place was not an invitation for anything sexual to happen in my opinion. Should I have never made out with him? I’ve never experienced anything like this before. 

TLDR: guy came over to my place and got mad at me for not wanting to do anything sexual",dating
1633,It Constantly Surprises Me How Many Otherwise Compatible People Just Don't Make Time For Dating/Partners,"Whether it's a job, life events...etc. It just floors be that some people don't seem to realize that their lives don't seem to be compatible for what they're looking for. 
I definitely understand it being hard to plan around work (I'm a Sous Chef myself), and I get peoples lives being busy, I love that yall have hobbies, good friends, the independence is really attractive ngl... However, I see so often this inability to plan time around a partner(s), or just simply not wanting to move things around. Either because you (understandably to a point) don't know if this person is gonna stick around/be safe to date..etc, but I dunno, and I totally get there's an element of ""they're just not that into you"" as well sometimes, just wish some people were more honest about communicating that, and I wish others were better at receiving that kind of news so that that communication could happen more often. 

I've unfortunately had to let quite a few people in my dating experience down saying I didn't think things would work out because of this. I dunno, I guess I'm just frustrated that so many otherwise compatible people just don't seem to have or want the time to pursue the kind of long term relationship I'm looking for, despite so many saying that I exude a lot of what they want in a partner, and value/want the same things as so many in relationships.",dating
1634,Boyfriend cheated,"I (31) am awake, and my boyfriend (42) of 2 years was using his phone to cast Netflix to the tv. He fell asleep, the tv asked if we’re to continue watching so I opened his phone to say yes. 

I have known his password for maybe a year but in the initial stage of our rship, I had told him I trust him and will never search his phone and I didn’t expect him to search mine aswel. If he  does have to use my phone I hand it to him freely and he does the same, in fact he was the one who told me his password.

Anyways, upon telling Netflix to continue playing , I decided to search his phone. Which is a promise I broke. But to my surpised I found a conversation of him speaking to someone on Jan 9, the conversation had been building over a few days it seems and on Jan 9, it progressed to them meeting up to have sex. It mentioned up to the very point where my boyfriend told the person that he was on the way, what road he was turning on and that he has arrived and  outside, the person said their pu*ssy was wet and waiting. My boyfriend explicitly said he was going to Fck the person raw and pump his load in the person. 

The only message after that was the person saying “I take it you didn’t enjoy that as much as I did”. I gather that is because nothing was said after the meet and the number is now blocked. 

I don’t know how to proceed because the way I found out is me breaking his trust as well. 

I’m suppose to move in  officially with him July 1 and have already given up my apartment.

It surprised me because for me (28F) and many of my girlfriends, it's the exact opposite. If I'm in a fwb/hookup, it's only if the guy is smoking hot. Whereas if I'm going to be in a relationship with them, I don't care as much about hotness because if their personality is great, that matters to me too.

This wasn't because she went to therapy because she was already there and things didn't seem to change. But instead, it was because I was giving her plenty of love and affection. People kept telling her she just needed to go to therapy and everything would be fixed but turns out all she needed was someone to hold, spend time with, and have sex with her. And as long as her physical and emotional needs were being met she was fine. So in summary sometimes the cure for loneliness is not being alone for long periods of time.",dating
1640,Girlfriend (23f 21m 6 months together )claims to have been attacked,"Ok so I 21 male and my girl friend 23 female have been together for 6 months and yesterday my gf wadacting really weird and was off for the whole day and I kept asking her what was wrong and she wouldn't talk anyways let's fast forward to last night we were about to get freaky and she takes her cloths off and everything and I seen hickies on her neck and on her breast I ask her about them and she breaks down and tells me that she was raped I immediately got dress and was like we need to go to the hospital and get a rape kit done for you, her response was no she doesn't want to she doesn't want to go to the police she doesn't want to go to the hospital or anything and it's really making me question everything because she has no signs of putting up a fight like no bruises anywhere I'm really lost and confused with the whole situation and need help with it I kinda believe her but at the same time I don't. Every time I try talking to her about it she blows up on me or she just shuts down, any advice would help thanks.

Update 

So I’ve take the advice from everyone on here, I decided to do research on my own about the area at which she said she was raped I pulled up to the area and noticed that there are cameras, from the house close by and that there are camera at the actual park, since I noticed that I came home and told her that she should really go to the police over this and that I’d be with her every step of the way I told her about the cameras on the homes that would pick up the incident and that the park had cameras she immediately said for me to leave the situation alone and that she can handle herself, I really don’t know what to do from this point onward, I’ve been over thinking like crazy, I feel bad asking her about it because ik if it did happen it’s traumatizing to talk about so moving forward i don’t know what to do any insight would help.

Update:

I didn’t want to get family and some of my friends  involved but I had no other choice in this situation  I called my mom to talk to my mom and get insight on her and she told me that I need to leave immediately and then she said with all the evidence that is in front of me I should be smart enough to see through all the bs, after the phone call with my mother, I called my two of my friends and one was a girl that I knew got raped in the past and asked her about stuff and she told me to run for the hills that I’m getting played like a fool and being cheated on so ig that it’s time I leave, thank you all for the advice and for the comments.",dating
1641,Getting into a serious relationship early-on in life is the BIGGEST life hack of all time. No wonder our ancestors married early with just good-enough partners instead of getting into this whole cat-mouse race of dating.,"To me, dating is a massive waste of time and it was the biggest hassle of life until 3 years ago when I met my partner. We are not ideal-made-for-each-other romantic-novel-couple but we are very comfortable with each other. I decided (in my mind) that I'll marry her just a week after we met. And these 3 years have been the easiest, happiest 3 years of my life.

Since I'm in this relationship, I have so much free time and mental space that I sometimes feels like I'm doing something wrong with my life. I started working out regularly, reading a LOT more books and started a side-gig business too.

I'm pretty introvert with a laid-back personality. So this whole elaborate shopping, malefashionadvice, dressing ups, presenting yourself to women, competing with better-looking men, competing with richer men, asking women out, playing to her tunes until she agrees to meet, meeting and (hopefully) taking it forwards, if not then repeat from square 1 - gave me anxieties. I felt miserable in this rat-race and always wondered why was life so difficult.

Ever since getting into this relationship, all of that is gone. I wear what make me comfortable and sometimes GF gets me the clothes she thinks looks good on me (and that's all I care). I don't care what the girl next to me in a restaurant/bar thinks of me. I don't give a crap if some girl ""gives me a signal"", or if someone adds me on Instagram. I don't even use social media too much anymore or build my ""presence"" there. I don't need to do things like going out often, increasing social circle to get more dates. And I don't need the constant agony of online dating anymore.

I can't list in what ways my life has gone from 4/10 to 11/10.

The older I'm getting, the most I'm realising why some people are conservative towards dating and marriage. Why some people have settled with their high school sweetheart without trying too many ""fishes in the ocean"". Those must be the smartest of all men imo.

Edit: I think many people are confused. We live together but we are not married yet, she's going through her PhD and I'm going back to college to get an MBA so we'll marry within a couple of years. 

""He didn't say anything nice about her girlfriend, what's a horrible person"" - Well that's exactly the point, random strangers have nothing to do with what my gf means to me. The whole point of this post is how a stable relationship has made my life easier. And how much detrimental the flawed concept of unlimited fast-dating is. 

An alarming number of people in this comments section seem to want to date a person who would ""make them happy"". I don't think even a perfect partner can make you happy if you aren't happy yourself. I was very happy even before my gf came along (except for the dating agony).

I might be wrong for the blanket statement that whoever marries early is a smart person. That may not be true but the statement that ""by dating more people I learn about myself"" is just as cringe as those meaningless hustler statements from success gurus e.g. ""goal is not a destination it's a journey"" or some shit.",dating
1642,How a tinder match gave a traumatic experience ( read for your safety),"8 months ago I met this guy on tinder , we texted for few days then he asked me out , the first date was good and he was nice there was no red flags 

After the 3rd date we had sex then we admitted both we liked other and we want to give a relationship a try so we both deleted tinder after 2 weeks , few red flags about him started to show like controlling he would want me to share my location if I went out ,he called me everyday and if I didn’t answer he would get mad also he would get mad if we didn’t have sex every time we meet and I wish I have stopped talking to him since I saw that red flag but I was so stupid I decided to ignore it and thought he just being insecure and he would change later 

Fast forward to the traumatic night , we decide to go to the beach park he was so bored and stressed that night so he told me he wants to go to a calm place And he knows a good spot where it’s dark and we can see the city view it was also close to the beach park I suggested but when we drove there I never knew this spot exists it was empty place , dark area literally no lights, no people ,only very few cars there

I asked him if it’s safe for us to be there he comforted me we will be safe no worries anyway we went there, we were inside the car enjoying the view but he was still stressed so I tried to talk to him to see if he wants to vent or smth he said he wants to make out so we Made out then he suggest to have sex in the car I said ok and when we start to have sex I wasn’t comfortable at all I stopped him and told him I don’t want to do it here or today I’m sorry , he changed so fast he got so mad and screamed to get the hell out of the car If I truly love my life or wants to save my life as what i understood, I was literally begging him to just drive to the main road then I will take a taxi or call a friend because In that area there was no phone signal literally no main road and no lights, I was so fkin scared and just begged him to not leave me he pushed me out and drove away , I didn’t know what to think or what to do ,it was absolutely dark area I start hearing dogs and got so fkin scared so there was no way out but for me to open my phone flash light and to fkin run till I find a light or a main road because if I stayed there I would get 100% kidnapped or killed and wouldn’t be found .

I start running like crazy i don’t know where or which direction I’m running towards , he came back and almost hit me with his car I fell back I was so scared I couldn’t see it’s him and his car I thought it’s someone else and I’m definitely kidnapped , he came out of the car screaming saying “ because I love god I won’t fkin leave you here I just wanted to scare you because you made me mad “ , I didn’t say anything I just wanted him to take me to a main road and get a taxi and get tf outta there , he was my only solution and I thanked god he came back .

He was screaming after I got inside the car and called me all types of insult I still didn’t say anything so he won’t take me back to that empty area again , we stopped at a gas station that where I got out fast of his car and there was few taxis so I was walking towards it , he grabbed me violently by my arms and asked me to pay for the gas I answered “why please just let me go it’s enough you can’t do anything there’s people around us “

He said it’s repayment for all the money he paid for our dates , ( mind you He only paid one date and I paid the rest of the dates and he only paid like 20$ something like that for one date ) and he wanted 100$ for the gas , he literally threat me to pay now or he will harass me in my work place if I didn’t pay for gas now so I just gave him the gas money and left fast and took a taxi and reached home safely 

After that night I didn’t talk to anyone for days I was so sad , mad and traumatized because I already have phobia from dark empty places and the fact someone I trusted gave me that horrible experience for just saying no to sex , made me completely not trust any fkin online dating  app again and of course I haven’t gone to any date from tinder again I deleted my account on it and blocked that asshole

I’m so sorry it was long to read but I truly typed this for you to pay huge attention to your safety when you are on tinder date or any other dating app please ,stay safe and thanks for reading

Edit : thanks so much for the supportive comments , I forgot to add a detail : after I blocked him he texted from a fake number apologizing for that night and the reason he was mad and stressed his mom yelled at him LMAOOO I shouldn’t laugh at my pain but it’s ridiculously funny reason ugh , he probably felt good to take his anger on me cuz I seemed dumb in his eyes",dating
1643,Is it possible to know within first two dates that you could be really really good with someone and probably love them quickly?,"Feeling a little like a weirdo right now. Like actually crazy. Went on two dates with this guy off of tinder - dates both lasted 10+ hours/ ended with crazy compatible sex and at the end of the second date we both admitted we really really like each other-more than anyone before. Issue is I don’t know if this is normal at all or I’m being dumb/lustful/caught up/whatever. He is only visiting family in my city anyway and we would immediately go LDR. I feel dumb. I’m so confused.

Edit: thanks everyone for replying! I get a little overwhelmed by more than like 5 comments so I’m just going to cover some things here. 

I’ve thought about everything a lot in the last few hours. 

I do appreciate everyone who brought up love bombing. My best friend also brought it up cautiously to check. I am aware of the love bombing concept and while I do understand it’s very tricky to detect/ unravel I strongly do not get the feeling that this is the case. 

While he has been very complimentary and paid for most things for our dates and admitted many times he likes me/ we click (signs, I know) I think we’re both weirded out by it. Neither of us are dumb enough to bring up words like “love” or “soulmates” (except I did to describe my best friend lmao). We know it’s impossible to have love at this point. He hasn’t said anything like “he can’t live without me” or has smothered me outside of our dates (at all. He’s a “doer” so not on his phone much). We have barely discussed our future at all. It sounds like he is/ has been cautious about getting into a relationship right now because he travels so much and at least at the very beginning of our 2nd date sounded satisfied letting “us” end after he leaves and enjoying the moment. However, by the end of the 2nd, sounds conflicted now, like I am. If I do catch whiff of anything like “love” and “can’t live without” within 2 or 3 months I will be much more on my toes. Plus, maybe I’m wrong but I think it’d b hard to control/ manipulate me from another state lmao. 

To end, to all pointing out that this is mainly just infatuation/ honeymoon phase I also do understand that as well unfortunately. I know that if I in theory got into a relationship with him, it wouldn’t always be this passion. The real him is still even deeper. But the fact remains I’ve still never felt this way about someone before. I can’t express how well we click naturally on so many levels. I thought about it and thinking about him dating someone else? I feel like she’d just be the luckiest fucking person in the world. Like it’d be unfair. 

I don’t want to do anything rash like commit to any sort of committed relationship off the bat/ within the first three months esp if it’d be an LDR. But I think I’d regret just letting him walk away. I’d always wonder. I’m going to pursue with caution. And if I end up getting fucked over lmao, well it’s nothing new. Nothing learned nothing gained, right?",dating
1644,"Me a girl, asked for a guys number and got it!!!","Girls, honestly go ask the guy you think is cute for his number. A wave of confidence washed over me, I was so nervous and shaky and couldn’t believe I had actually done it… that he actually said yes and gave me his number!",dating
1645,"He declined hooking up, what does this mean?","I went on a first date and he didn’t want to hook up. I borderline invited him up when he dropped me off but he said he didn’t want to put himself in a position to have to spend the night or have a “night cap”. He did kiss me before I walked into my place but he didn’t text me the next day at all. He also didn’t touch me at all the whole date. Not to hold my hand or put his arm around me. I’m wondering if he didn’t want to hook up because he wasn’t interested in me physically? Or maybe he doesn’t hook up with people? I’m very open about sex so I don’t believe sex and commitment have anything to do with each other. I’ve been single for a while so I’ve had FWB and dated around for a while. More recently I decided to stop dating unless I see a future with the guy. Do you think him declining means he’s uninterested??

Edit: it’s not THAT serious you guys. The date was a lot of fun and we both vaguely mentioned wanting to go on a second date. In my experience, men only go as far as a women would let them and I’m in a bit of a debate on if him rejecting hooking up meant something different as it gave me mixed signals from the way the rest of the date went.",dating
1646,How do you date in 2023 if you aren't interested in using dating apps?,I want a relationship to develop organically. I want to get to know the person first. I'd actually prefer a relationship that starts out as a friendship. I feel like this is the best way to form a romantic relationship because you know the other person likes your personality and isn't trying to use you But how do you meet someone naturally when you don't have school to facilitate that?,dating
1647,Why don’t guys like sex?,"Just hear me out (and don’t send me creepy PMs). I’ve been casually dating and met a few guys over some time. I make sure there are no red flags and they meet my standards. They treat me good and tell me we are on the same page about casual DATING. Things eventually lead to sex (3rd date or later) and we have a great time. They look like they are having the time of their lives but after that first night their behavior changes. No longer do they want to go on dates, do cute things, or spend time together. Heck, with most guys they don’t even want to hook up again after the first or second time. They completely lose interest. I would love a consistent dating for fun (especially sexual fun) or even a FWB situation, but seems like guys don’t enjoy sex and only like the chase/accomplishment of getting a girl. Why is that? For me, if I enjoy someone’s company and sex I want to repeat the things I enjoy. Please help a confused girl out.",dating
1648,Act like you don’t care.,"For context, I’m a 24 y/o guy. I’m decently good looking and fit.

Often you hear in the dating world to act like you don’t care, which is true. Once the scent of desperation fades, women become attracted to you. 

When I was 18-20 I was an idiot. I would go out with the intention of meeting girls and I realized at one point how stupidly obvious that was to them. I self reflected, grew as a person and now treat women that Im attracted to as I would anybody (as I should have when I was younger and stupid!) and I gotta say, it really does work.

That’s why men in relationships say they get way more attention the moment they get a girlfriend it’s because they are confident and at ease talking to women, since they are already taken. 

Now… when I say act like you don’t care. That doesn’t mean not showing interest or flirting! What it means is don’t text back fast or seem eager. Chat a bit, plan your date, and leave her wondering. 

(I am aware everybody’s experiences are unique. If texting each other everyday is working for you, fantastic. If it’s not broke don’t fix it. This is a broad statement / piece of advice that has worked for me.) 

Its also a good way to find out if a girl is into you. Stop asking questions. Does she text you back trying to keep the conversation going?

If not, who cares and move on.

Good luck out there, Gentlemen.",dating
1649,So annoyed about my “situationship”,"I (22F) met him (26M) on hinge a couple of months ago. Everything was amazing, although we were very different it was so easy to be with him and he would often tell me how nice it is that he can just be himself around me. We would go on dates almost every weekend (we were both usually too tired to plan things after work) and we often talked about future dates and things we would like to do together. 

Fast forward to about a month ago, he explains that he is not emotionally available enough to continue to date me and thanks me when I said that I understood where he was coming from. I also left it up in the air that he should reach out to me when he is feeling better. 

I’m just annoyed, why would you actively pursue someone if you aren’t emotionally available? If you aren’t feeling ready for something then why lead me on? I just hate that I wasted all that time and effort on someone who probably wasn’t in it from the beginning.",dating
1650,hook up culture sucks,"urgh i feel stupid and i’m venting but i want to let it out i am embarrassed to tell my friends.

i met a guy on hinge and he was really nice and a sweetheart. we texted for 2 weeks before meeting, i didn’t have the time to hang out sooner.

the day we did hung out was really nice, we had a walk at the beach and we ate and then went back to his. causal. 

next day we hung out and we hooked up and now he hasn’t text me. i feel used and ugly. 

my issue is i don’t mind hooking up as long as i know it will be that but this guy had me texting him, getting to know him for 2 weeks and now he’s gone.

1651,Whats up with men defending f*ckboy & infidelity tendencies with science??,"So, I've been watching this debate on Youtube by Whatever - HEATED Debate With College Girls, and I've also come across men, whose answer to why promiscuity is frowned upon in women, but encouraged, is:

1- Men have to work harder (*I understand this part*) , but

2 - Apparently they all use the scientific excuse of spreading genes. *And before you defend this - In fact, I also just came across a scientific study that said that women having multiple partners is better to ensure a healthier population, so there, it's crushed.)*

And in the debate , this self-proclaimed ""alpha"" male, like all guys striving to be alphas, blames the women for making themselves available. **This is definitely not a battle of genders, everyone involved is making the conscious decision to sexually pursue the other.** He says something along the lines of ""if it wasn't on the table, then men wouldn't do it"".

So what I'd want to know is, if a guys in a relationship, how is any of these a valid excuse for infidelity?

Are they animals? Amongst the things that put us at the top of the food chain are discernment, consciousness, morals, higher intellectual capacity.. etc.

The guy said ""Oh, yeah I have a wife, she's loyal, but I may have some side action"" ***Like... Hello?*** How is this person being looked up to? (*Idk if he is, but apparently he was getting praise in the comments*). I would lose interest and respect for any guy that's this way, even if he had all the traits of a dream man, he instantly turns to a cockroach.

Regardless, monogamous relationships are called just that for a reason.

How is this even fair? ""Oh because I'm a man, it's in my nature to spread as much offspring as possible"" Like.. dude gtfo. I've always dreamed of finding the man of my dreams, but this puts me off having hope, entirely. Fuck. That.

If being in a relationship means accepting that my partner will always be thirsting and lusting or wanting to sexually pursue others, even on rare occasions, I'd rather stay single for the rest of my life.

Is there a guy that will make a conscious decision to just want one person, without ever feeling tempted? Procreate with 1 person?

If you dare to say he could get bored, like... That's what healthy communication is for, in relationships.

To stroke his ego? Is it not enough? Does he need more approval?

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

*OK, I haven't got through all the comments, yet. I realized I needed to be more specific in the things I wonder about.*

*What I meant to ask was if men have this subconscious hardwire / natural instinct to just pursue any woman. Subconsciously. There's a comment mentioning testosterone , that a guy said he'll undress women in his head, cause of the hormone. This is what I wanna know. Is it nature?*

*And, I got a dm from someone kind enough to explain things to me and hear me out. They mentioned that there are loyal men, as most of you mentioned, which is good. I get that, I'm very happy to hear that.*

*I'm asking a genuine question, cause I am curious.*

*Keep in mind, I see these people a lot. I'd be talking to some guy, trying to take me out and whatnot then find out they're married or something... So excuse me if my question offends you. Keep the negativity to yourself. I'm genuinely curious. I don't mean to point fingers or generalize, so sorry if my choice of words made it seem this way.*

*Insight to where I'm coming from:*

*I was raised by a single mother and am an only child, which doesn't help me find an answer.*

*I once spoke to a guy and he was so adamant about pursuing me and taking me out, but later got a text from some random woman asking me to ""stop talking to my husband"" IM LIKE YO?! IM TALKING TO SOMEONES HUSBAND? Like... Yikes man. I had a conversation with her, then I confronted him , he said she was his ""crazy ex"", I decided to never speak to him again.*

*Keep in mind this is not the first time something like this happens to me.*

*I had a lot of guys try to take me out, then find out they're married , by their friends, or they tell me like yeah I'm taken.... I know a lot of women around me who's husbands have been disloyal etc  horrible.*

***That doesn't mean I'll think all men are that way. Here, I'm talking about the claim that men are hardwired, and use stuff like this science to back their claims up.***

*I have the guys following an ""alpha"" path or person, telling me stuff like this, when I ask why men do these things, or why its okay for them to be so promiscuous, but when it comes to their women its like nope.*

*I'm 26, and I envision a relationship with a man on my level. I'm honest, loyal, intelligent, etc. My ideal relationship is based on a strong foundation, held and created by 2 individuals.*

*Then I stumble across videos like these.*

*I know I can be loyal af and not desire any other person ever idc if they were Hercules, I know I'd see my partner as Zeus or something. That's why I ask.*

*So excuse me if my question offends you. lmao... Anyway, I'm intellectual enough to want to ask and know. I'm on reddit to ask for people's insight, opinions, and to learn more. Maybe my choice of words, wasn't the greatest, but you got the gist, and that's what's important.*

*I'd appreciate it if people didn't comment so aggressively, it's not a good look for you. Answer with your honest opinions. It is the internet, so whatever. I'm unphased by aggression or toxicity. I'm sorry if you were hurt in life, and feel the need to project it in the comments. I hope you find sunshine and rainbows someday.*

*I'm not talking about the harsh truth, I'm down for that. I'm talking about choice of words, in a sense. Name-calling or pointing. and Yes, I appreciate everyone who's answered this, thank you for giving me insight and educating me.*

1652,Funny/bad stories from dating apps?,"I'm 28M from Glasgow UK. I've had one relationship back in 2019, someone I met on Match dating site, lasted 3 months till it ended. Been on apps like Bumble, Tinder Boo and Match over last few years, been a rollercoaster ride to say the least.

These things are a double edged sword at times, sometimes people have met on them had kids, settled down and married, some people have had their time wasted. Some catfished and call offs at the last minute.
Sometimes in life, you've got to see the funny side of things.

One of my stories comes from last year, I matched with someone from my work last year on Tinder (different office) 
She got chatting with me, her profile said that she was chatty, we got chatting, she mentioned people from my work and asked if I knew them, even mentioned my boss, we got chatting , she took a while to reply (she said she was against ghosting others) then we arranged a date, on the day of the date, she called off last minute, we planned to rearrange, so I sent her a mail asking if she wanted to hang out on Sunday, (got her number on WhatsApp and we spoke from there)
Her status said online, but she wasn't looking at the message, she was at it, playing games and wasting my time, if she was that interested, she'd be banging my door down. Blocked and moved on 🤣",dating

1658,Dinner at his — we all know what this date is,"I (25F) am going over to this guy I’ve been seeing(28M)’s place this week because he is cooking us dinner. This will be our 4th date, and I’m well aware of the context of the date, but I was wondering what the social graces are as I haven’t dated much since college. 

I told him I wanted to bring something, and he said beer would be great. I will grab a local beer from my shop as I consider myself quite the beer connoisseur, and he has told me in the past what kinds of beer he enjoys. Should I bring anything else? He has a home outside the city, and I feel it improper to show up without flowers or something, but he’s not a gal-pal, so I’m not sure what the protocol is. He has a dog, and I was also thinking about maybe just bringing a toy for the pup along with the drinks.

1659,Never Felt So Confident...," 

I'm (27M) a relatively lean man who goes to the gym around 2-3 times a week..

My GF (26F) cooked lunch earlier and I have eaten a lot (she is a really good cook). Afterwards while we are sitting together on the sofa, while watching Netflix, she stared poking my bloated belly while smiling and I said ""stop teasing me, I'm working out so that I'll have abs😅"" she said, ""nope I think you look a lot hotter with this (squeezing my protruding belly)😊"" And then proceeded to lie down on the sofa and used my belly as a pillow...

I realized if a woman actually loves you, she wont care about how you look and will make you feel confident regardless.

Now, I'll still work out but just to maintain a lean healthy body and not for looks since the only lady that I wanna impress already thinks that I look great...

1661,5 things I LOVE about online dating after a year,"There is a lot of negativity towards modern dating, and I have my worse days with it too. But I also like some aspects of it, so I thought I'll add a more positive take on the subject.

Context: I'm a mid-20s male from an EU country, in a big city. I registered on several dating apps a year ago. I only look for a relationship - so far, unsuccessfully. In one year, I've been to about 50 dates, most of them first dates.

So my five favourite things from my experiences:

**1) Widened my perspective**

Most of my friends and family comes from the same ""bubble"", and have a similar viewpoints about many things. With these dates, I've seen many different backgrounds I would not come across when dating from extended friend circles, school or university. I also know much more about the daily experiences of people in many industries, companies, living in different neighborhoods etc.

**2) Taught me to take rejection**

For the first few times, getting rejected, being unmatched or ghosted was gruesome. Eventually, I learned to see things statistically, and not taking anyone for granted. Now I'm not afraid of some saying no for a first or second date, or suddenly not replying, because I know I someone else will say yes.

**3) Taught me how to reject someone without hurting their feelings**

I learnt that almost everyone responds well to direct communication, and respects my choices, even if they expected something else. I was always terrified in similar situations before, even remained in a toxic relationship for a while, because I was afraid of breaking up. Now doing these ""mini break-ups"" several times, I doubt this will ever ne an issue again.

**4) Made me better at talking to anyone**

My experiences made me a better listener, and taught me how to ask better questions. They also made me better at talking about myself in a way that's interesting, humble, yet makes a good impression. I'm better at breaking the ice, doing small talk, but also initiating deeper topics.

**5) Taught me how to better ""brand"" myself**

For the first few months I barely had matches, and I had to work on my profile a lot. I learned how to give a good, but honest impression of myself in only a few pictures and a short bio. This could be useful for writing a CV, social media profile, or even copy for a product.

Overall, this was a difficult journey, but I think it gave me a lot of good experiences in exchange for all the time and the stress.

1662,I think I’m falling out of love with my husband….advice?,"Recently I randomly started disliking my husband. Everything he does irk me his existence irritates me. I don’t know what it is but i have reasons I might be falling out of love with him. 
Reason 1 He doesn’t clean after himself he leaves countless of dishes in the sink and when I mention it to him he says he’ll do it later but never does. Im always working but I had a surgery which allowed me to get 2 weeks off of work despite being in pain I got up early and cleaned the entire house for hours. I told him to keep up with the cleaning so it won’t get bad again. What did he do? Drop clothes on the floor, leaves dirty bowls on the dresser, and cotton swabs with ear wax left on the dresser. 

Reason 2. His personal hygiene isn’t the best he could go throughout the whole week without showering. I remember he was off of work because of some class for 3 weeks he didn’t brush his teeth shower or nothing. I tell him countless of times how I want him to start fixing his hygiene he tells me “he doesn’t like water” which pissed me off. 
Reason 3. He rarely takes me out or do nice things for me, grocery shopping is the funnest thing we’ve done. When I ask him to take me out he says he doesn’t have money but when his friends ask to go somewhere he would take money from our savings and use it to go out and sometimes he would use his credit card that he’s trying to pay off because he’s in debt. Flowers? Never heard of it. 
Reason 4. He spends the majority of his time playing videos games. From when he gets off of work at 3 till 2/3 am the next day. He’d stop every 2 hours or so to say something to me then that’s it. 

There’s more reason why I’m feeling how I’m feeling but these are my top things. I don’t know what to do about him, advice? 
SN: I’ve expressed how I feel about these things to him multiple and nothing has changed",dating
1663,Guys should be less afraid to talk to women in public,"Recently I have had much more success with dating since overcoming my fear of talking to women in public, previously it would all be through dating apps.

The most common excuses I see and I also used to give are 'oh I don't want to bother them' 'I don't want to be a creep' 'it's weird, no one does that' 'I don't want to get rejected in person' bla bla bla

The problem is that mindset is totally wrong and they are all simply excuses that you use to avoid going outside of your comfort zone. There is absolutely nothing wrong with approaching a woman you find attractive in public as long as you do it in a polite and friendly way.

Worst case? They will say 'I have a boyfriend' 'I'm not interested' 'I don't give my number out' or rarely just ignore you completely.

The thing is, those results are actually positive. Because the fact you even had the balls to approach her in public is 99.99% better than what most men can do nowadays. 

Often, if they 'reject' you they will even compliment your bravery and confidence, and take it as a compliment. In the end, the approach will bring a smile on their face that someone nicely approached them and was interested. (yes, some girls may be 'offended' that a man approached them, but let's be real who would want to date someone like that anyway). 

Best case? The brief conversation flows and she has interest in continuing the conversation online and you can arrange a date. 

It's really a win-win situation.

Of course, it matters how you approach them, but it's not rocket science, just need basic body language reading skills and don't push them or take too much of their time, keep it brief, be honest that you find them cute/beautiful/whatever from the get-go, if they're not interested who cares just let them take it as a compliment and move on. Don't approach people who are clearly in a big rush, with their family, on the phone etc etc. Eye contact is often key, if you catch a girl locking eyes with you (for more than just a brief glance) it's often but not always a sign she likes what she sees. 

I have now done this many times and never had a bad experience, worst case is just a polite rejection to exchanging contact info, but you can't take rejection personally, they could have a boyfriend, they may never give out contact so quickly, they may simply not be attracted to you, they may not be looking for any type of dating right now. Who knows and who cares, even the most attractive people in the world will get rejected multiple times. 

Usually I just say 'excuse me' to get their attention and just be completely honest to start, 'I think you are cute' then proceed with a basic introductory conversation, name, age, what they do, where they're from, keep it brief and say 'well I don't want to take too much of your time, but would you like to exchange (phone number, instagram, whatever)'. It should be pretty obvious if they have some level of interest in you or not by their body language and how they engage in the conversation, obviously if I can tell they are not receiving it positively I won't ask for the contact at the end just say have a nice day and move on. 

Some examples of where I have done this:

1. At a bus stop - was waiting with my friend for an Uber, saw a girl walk past me who really caught my eye and she sat down at the bus stop, went up to her and just said 'excuse me, I really like your style!' her reaction was really positive and we talked as above for a couple minutes, 3 days later we went on a date!
2. On a street crossing, she was waiting to cross as was I, I left my friends and went to talk to her, 4 days later we went on a date!
3. Bars/Clubs of course is the easiest place to do this, but there is something much more satisfying about doing it totally sober during the daytime.

Now I have learned that the reality of approaching girls in public is much different to how most people perceive it to be, we always think about the worst outcomes and blow it out of proportion, if someone politely came up to you and said hey, I think you're cute, had a brief conversation and asked for your contact you would be pretty happy right, even if you weren't interested in them. Just do it in the right way. 

Does being attractive help? Of course it does, as it does with every single aspect of life. No one can change that, but confidence is very attractive, and having the confidence to go up to a woman that caught your eye shows a man who doesn't live in the confines of fear.",dating
1664,I think I just got ghosted after a first date,"I’m not gonna lie, the first time I saw his face he looked different compared to his photos. Cute, but not as cute as his pictures. But I still kinda liked him because he was nice and tall. We cuddled, watched movies and made out. He complimented me a couple times, saying I looked good then I’d get shy then he’d laugh. He also told me I was good at kissing. By the time he was leaving he hugged me a lot and kissed me more. To me, it was a cute little date, lots of smiling. Then on his way home his texts were dry and his texts were dry on the next day, saying “haha” “cool” “yeah”, like one word or two word replies so I did the same, then he told me he had some stuff to do and I responded with ok, good luck with that and that was my last response, I know he’s been active but he hasn’t texted me the whole day. I just feel anxious and can’t sleep properly knowing that maybe I’ve just been rejected, I can accept rejection but it makes me feel like shit because I actually liked him and was comfortable with him. And I don’t date much so I’m not very used to this feeling. I just want advice to help me clear my thoughts and feel better :)

Edit: I made it clear to him that I don’t hook up/have sex with people I just met and he understood that then said he wanted to see me and take me on a date.",dating
1665,"Living with your parents shouldn’t be frowned upon anymore, in light of how ridiculous the cost of living has become","Minimum wage has barely (and I mean BARELY) increased over the years, despite inflation rising rapidly. If minimum wage kept up with inflation, it would be much higher then it is now. Someone making 40k a year can barley afford to support themselves anymore. I believe this is due to lobbying and corporate greed. My main point, however, is that in the dating/social world, people tend to look down on those who live with their parents in their early-to-mid-20s. With the cost of living being so unbearably high, and wages being kept at (let’s call it what it is) slave wage, it should no longer be looked down upon.",dating
1666,"Random girl approached me, what is your opinion on the interaction?","So I went to a fairly busy cafe/bookstore. Right when I walk in a see a girl staring at me and following me with her eyes. I look at her and she looks away but quickly keeps looking at me. Like turning her entire head to look at me. Well I notice she gets up and starts heading in my direction. To be honest she was a very unattractive girl. So I quickly walked out of the cafe. But I turn around and see her still following me out. She approaches me to my car and awkwardly introduces herself and ask me question. I’m in shock so respond briefly. She eventually leaves awkwardly. 

Well I felt like she obviously found me attractive however I didn’t feel the same. I felt really bad about how I wasn’t responding perhaps the way she imagined.  Well what are your thoughts about this?",dating
1667,Should I back out of this date - following naked girls on IG?!,"So I’m supposed to go on a date with this 40-year-old guy that I met on Hinge this evening. Decided to see if we had any mutual friends so I looked at his Instagram List and he is following hundreds of bikini/raunchy models on social media. This is starting to creep me out and I wonder if I should back out, it’s just strikes me as someone who is immature or only after sex. Am I reading too much into this?",dating
1668,I think I became addicted to being alone,"Just venting will probably delete. 

I freaking hate dating sometimes, though. It is such a hassle to get dressed up and meet up with someone on a regular basis. I get moments where I get jealous of my friends in relationships and do enjoy being checked up on but anything involving consistently hanging out and sacrificing my alone time sounds like a hassle at times. I love being home alone unbothered, not being stressed out over anyone and just being a lazy ass after work tbh. Or dedicating that time to the gym or being with family.

To be fair, I am just starting off my career and maybe I am just not interested in dating right now. But I also feel this pressure that I need to hurry up and find someone (29F for context). 

ugh.",dating
1669,Don't know how to tell her,"Has unprotected sex with this woman I met in AA. We like each other a lot, I think but she's newly sober and she declared she wants to slow things down after we hooked up. She has pretty much initiated us hanging out and hooking up and I'm by no means forcing anything here. However, the day after our trist my dick was pretty sore I chalked it up to her being kind of stubbly and grinding on me a lot.  She had recently shaved but had stubble growing in. The next day kind of looked like razor burn and the following day all was back to normal. Few days later found a pimple on my shaft. I  did my due diligence and got tested just in case even though this ordeal didnt really look serious nor was it coupled with any symptoms of any STI that I read online aside from the lone pimple. Got my lab results back and apparently I have herpes. I don't know if I got them from her or I already had it as herpes can be dormant. I know that I have to tell her. Things are already starting to die out between us in a way which is a real bummer to me but regardless she needs to know. How the fuck do I tell this poor woman the first time she's hooked up sober she might have gotten Herpes? I've never had any symptoms or outbreaks before and had absolutely no idea. This will definitely ruin things between us but I know that I have to tell her. How do I do this?

Update: upon further testing found that I did not have an active outbreak but still have HSV1 antibodies. Although common and not necessarily contagious I still told her about my status.",dating
1670,My date keeps insisting that she know my job. Red flag?,"I have a 6 figure job that i like to keep to myself because whenever I tell women, their eyes light up. I often have trouble telling the difference between a woman who wants to give me the time of day because of my personality, or maybe it's just the job.

So before meeting up, she says she must know what I do for a living otherwise she's not gonna show up. I told her ""Im doing alright for myself, I don't feel like talking about my job"".

Is this a red flag? It seems as though she doesn't even care about me and just wants to know what I do for a living.",dating
1671,Texting after the first date,"I started talking to a girl online, a couple of flirty messages then I asked her to hang out, she accepted we met and everything went great, we talked for a couple of hours, laughed a lot and really had a good chemistry that I didn't really expect.  After I drove her home at the end of our date we exchanged numbers and that was it. I said to myself that I will wait for her to text me because I was the one who initiated everything the first time and if she really is  interested  she would reach out to me , but it's been almost 2 days and we haven't talked since then so I feel confused in what should I do.",dating
1672,People on dating apps need to stop asking the other out in the first message.,"I don't need to spend weeks texting you before meeting up, but let's at least exchange like 20 messages getting to know each other before you invite me for a drink. I am not going to skip the gym, shave my legs, and put on makeup when all I know about the guy is that he has abs and likes pineapple on pizza.. I get that you shouldn't invest too much before meeting in person, but asking me out without even knowing my personality makes me think you are desperate or have some kind of motive.

Dates are way more likely to be successful if we've shared a joke or two and speak about our dating intentions beforehand. If you want to meet someone immediately just ask for a facetime or something. A lot of people say they hate ""small talk"" but how else am I supposed to vet whether you are a mentally stable human. I won't reply to a guy if he does this and who knows there could have been a great connection if you weren't so rushed. Just venting and open to opposing views.

1673,Everyone seems to wait at the finish line.,"Little rant. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told to “work on myself” or “love myself”. And that “one day” that “special someone” will be there- conveniently when I actually have an established career.

So I’m in the process of improving my career, my looks, everything. But I have to say one thing.

I see plenty of men with drinking problems, drug problems, guys who have served jail time, have success with women. 

Idk- I’d love to find someone who is working on themselves and build together. It seems ridiculous that a significant other is just a trophy for success, and not someone you can build and develop with.

I think the best time to look for a SO is when you are at your beginning stages of your self-development journey. Because they deserve you at your best, if they love you at your worst.

Idk- maybe this is me just justifying the reality that I am unattractive, and that people tend to care about what they can get now. But I would gladly be with someone who wasn’t happy with their life yet either",dating
1674,Guy I went out with pulled out a knife on the first meeting,"So, a few days ago I went on a date with a guy I matched with on a dating site, we met in a bar, had a few drinks and then he told me he needed to grab some things from his place and since it was on the way, maybe we could smoke up together for a while before he dropped me off. He seemed like a nice person so I went with it. We reached his place and it was a three bedroom flat. We were talking about casual things and out of nowhere he tells me he wants to show me something. He went to his cupboard and got one of those hunter knives to me, I was terrified. I was thinking about all the ways things could go wrong. Then he starts telling me about how sharp the knife is and asks me to touch it to prove his point, which I did.
Fortunately he did not harm me, but honestly if I had balls, they would have been in my mouth that day. I don't know what made him think that it was a great idea? I blocked him and never contacted him after that.

Edit: a lot of people are saying that it's just ""boys being boys"" and I understand that it'd have been normal, but it's also about how sketchy he was behaving. I personally love knives and would not have gotten scared in a normal scenario.",dating

The thing is, I don't really like working out and never thought once about bulking up. In fact, i was always accepting of my body. But lately, I've been using some dating apps and it's discouraging that none of the women I liked didn't message me back.

1685,Why are short relationships sometimes harder to get over?,"I’ve noticed it’s been taking me a long time to get over a girl i dated for a short period of 1.5 months.

I think the problem is that it’s so easy to idealize someone when you don’t fully know them yet and you’ve **only**   experienced fun and good times with them. In my case i got along  easily  with this girl and she’s my type. The only dates we had were us   cuddling on the couch, watching movies, talking and being intimate. We   brought eachother food we liked and even tho we didn’t have a strong   spark or chemistry, everything was just comfortable. I only seen her   best sides and it was too short to see real flaws.

I   have no idea what spending a full day with her would be like. I don’t   even know what it would be like waking up next to her in the morning or   getting into a argument. I have no idea what it would be like to go   through a difficult time with her. I don’t even know if we would really   be compatible. Hell, i haven't even seen her outside the house or done   any normal, mundane activity with her.

Now  my mind is free to guess on what it could have been like if we had  continued. And ofcourse, it makes up all the **best possible scenarios**.   She’s suddenly the potential dream girl i lost. It’s hard to shake  this  feeling. She left me for her ex who came back, so i guess i’ll  never  know what it could have been like if her ex had not came back.

1688,Are men never really interested in knowing women at all?,"This has been, almost without exception, the case when I go out on dates. After a first or couple of dates, I know so much about them - their interests, education, work, what they like and don't like, birthdays, hobbies, travels etc.

But I find the men are rarely ever interested in getting to know you as a person. All they seem to be interested in is if you are nice and/or pretty and will fit into their lives. The conversation flows, but it's almost entirely centred around him and what he thinks and what he wants. All they seem to do is evaluate you as a person but never really want to get to *know* *you*.

1696,Gf fully against any kinds of birth control,"So my lady (24f) and I (24m) enjoy a very fun and exciting sex life.  

The past 4 months we’ve essentially had to use 4 plan B’s.  Sometimes she’d just decide screw the condom and i (stupidly) obliged because it feels incredible.  

Recently we decided this isn’t worth it and have been doing only condom sex.  Well there was this incident where she felt like some semen was in her (i agree btw).

So she’s taking another.  I feel horrible because I know these pills are not easy for a woman to take and can take a toll on their bodies and mind.  She’s stressed about it and so am I.

We both dislike condoms but know it’s all we have.

She’s pretty much completely against any form of birth control.  The pill she’s not good at remembering and hates the hormonal part, and IUD she’s against as well.  All the other methods she feels iffy about especially if they’re hormonal.

I don’t know what I’m even here for other than to ask if anyone has this experience?  What did they do? I feel like to be careful enough is just not really having sex the fun and exciting way we both love.  Like getting rough and crazy kind of just amps up the risk it seems.

I feel like i can’t win and don’t want our sex life to be hindered.  Selfishly i wish she’d change her mind about birth control but I also don’t want to try to “convince” her of it because it’s her body and I 1000% respect it.  I just don’t want sex to be a source of anxiety for her or us anymore.  

Am i crazy for feeling this way?  It’s tough for me i feel as well because my last couple of people I’ve dated have been on birth control so I’m not used to this and it could be affecting my mindset on this.  How would you go about this scenario?  i just have to be more careful when having sex it seems.

My ideas are:

No longer having sex to orgasm while I’m still inside (with condom on) i should just pull out - sad though because we always orgasm together and it’s so intimate :(

Use the spermicidal lube condoms?

Have less sex - obviously sucks

EDIT: For all mentioning vasectomy, I do feel I’m a bit young for that and also we are pretty new to being partners.  

We were old exes and found ourselves back to each other but only officially became a couple like 2 weeks ago but have been “dating” for like 3 months.  Vasectomy seems much more intense than standard BC from my research and seems like something you do when you’re very sure about not wanting kids in your future (which i kinda want kids and can’t afford to do all of these surgeries)

Edit:2 i realized i kind of mistyped when I posted this at like 1 AM - there were time she said fuck it to the condom and times where I was like fuck it too.  We both were being stupid, but recently said fuck that because it's not worth it, but then this condom thing happened and kind of fucked us both up.  The condom didn't break but we were having rough and deep sex and when i came and we wrapped up and I pulled out, she felt extra wet and thought it was semen, I agreed with her and she took another plan B - it seems anomalous tbh, but has started a convo nonetheless

Edit 3: added to 2, she is definitely not trying to trap me into a pregnancy",dating
1697,Hate myself for not being attracted to him,"I went on a date with a guy awhile ago he wasn’t my type at all and didn’t really find him attractive but I always try and give ppl the benefit before I judge their appearance. I only matched with him tho cause of the comment he left and we made great conversation after that. Fast forward it’s been maybe a week, and he asked me out on a date. I decided hey he might look better in person give it a shot. Boy was I wrong.. he tried to dress nice (I think) showed up in some joggers and a purple sweater (he had asked me what my favourite colour was before the date) found it to be sweet to know he listened and remembered what I said. Once I saw him though, I literally wanted to pretend to leave for some reason but I’m glad I stayed. We talked for hours and hours at the restaurant , but I felt no spark unfortunately. I know he felt something though cause of how he was acting, trying to hug me and touch my hand. I should’ve listened to my gut tho and not gone on the date. I feel so horrible. But now I have to say I’m sorry I don’t think this is going to work out or something. Idek tbh he’s so nice but I just didn’t feel anything and it sucks!


Edit: there are a lot of replies I wasn’t expecting so many. But thanks I don’t feel so bad about not finding him attractive and also I just wanted to say, I wasn’t so bothered by how he dressed I just thought it was a bit odd to show up in joggers on a first date. I tried dressing fairly nice myself so I just expected the same. But how he dressed didn’t have anything to do with my attraction towards him. But thanks to everyone who replied with encouraging words i am going to muster up the courage to tell him. Happy dating everybody good luck!:)",dating

1699,What do I do?,"I'm a 35M with a job as a truck driver (local only, so home every day). I work pretty much all day from 6:15a-5p and am usually hungry and exhausted after work so I just drive the hour home, eat and try not to fall asleep before 9:30. 

I haven't been on a date in about 10 years. I don't drink anymore so I never go out to bars or anything to socialize. I feel really isolated and don't know how to go about trying to meet someone. 

I feel so out of practice, so to speak, and out of the loop. Like I don't know how to go about even attempting to talk to someone. I guess it's true that if you don't use it, you lose it. 

Writing this all out and proofreading it really makes it sound pathetic. But I figured, hey, it's the internet. So why the hell not try to ask for some advice. 

At this point I'd even be open to just random flings but I've never been much of a ""ladies man"" that was good at finding women. My last long-term relationship ended in 2012 and I basically psyched myself out afterwards. Now, everyone seems to be married or otherwise unavailable. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for, specifically. I guess it's more of just a ""what do I do/how to I start/how do I fix this situation?"".  

To be honest, I'm just lonely and lost. Short-term relationships/causal stuff would be also great at this point. An actual relationship even better. But I don't even know the first step.

1701,My boyfriend loves me,"Last night my(18f) bf(18m) took me out on a traditional date for the first time. (Dinner at a nice place, told me to dress up, told me not to worry about bringing my wallet). This is abnormal since our relationship is amazing but it has been anything but traditional. After dinner we went to his living room(our dorms have living rooms that are shared by 4-8 people) and we cuddled on the couch to continue watching the show we’ve been watching together. In between episodes, he leaned over and kissed me rather passionately, and somewhat spontaneously I told him I love him. He immediately, without hesitation, said he loves me too. 

This is a big deal for me because I’ve been in too many situations where I’ve been lead to believe someone cared about me romantically only to find out they only saw me as a friend(i.e. multiple dates over several months, flirting, holding hands/cuddling) and even though none of those situations were official relationships and me and bf have been far beyond that point for a long time I still have trouble believing it’s for real and not just in my head.

We talk for a while then he invites me to his house. I reply “No I’m not looking to have casual sex.” He says oh no I don’t want to hook up we can get dinner and drinks if you want sometime. Okay cool, the conversation continues into the next day. 

You should come over he says again. I ask why and he says to cuddle and watch a movie. I tell him we’re looking for different things and he’s like huh? I’m not trying to hook up. 

At this point I tell him good luck with his search I hope he finds someone.

I already told him I didn’t want to come over. Like wtf why can’t people just be honest about what they want. I wish they’d stop leading people on and then gaslighting them into believing it’s not gonna all end up as a hook up/casual sex/one night stand.

Eventually, we decided on a date and rather than me pick a midpoint that's close to the both of us, I went with her idea for a sports bar right next to where she lives. Being that it's far for me, I drove an hour out to get there and got there a little early so I waited. She messaged me that she was live-streaming and stuck in a matchmaking game of League so she was going to be late. 

Once she finally got there around 15-20 mins later, we ordered and chatted a little bit. She wasn't saying much but I was trying to keep the conversation alive. The food came out fast and I ordered another drink because it made sense to chat a little longer and get to know each other. She asked for the check almost immediately.

I have to believe somewhere in the vastness of everywhere and always, there was one guy who was valid enough to be inundated with DMs from women. The way women are by men.

1718,Guys: Are you still interested even after you got physical and couldn't keep a hard-on?,"*Throwaway

Got physical with someone I met twice. First time we got naked they had a boner. But once we got to the bed, they couldn't keep it on long enough for penetration. 

They did manage to get me off several times and giving me head. I gave them head too, but they just wouldn't get hard. 

Same thing on the second occasion. They were hard when they arrived at my place but then when we're in bed, their boner went limp for penetration. Again, they got me off instead and I gave them head and they finished.  

They keep telling me, it's not me, that they think I'm attractive, sweet, kind (all the things they wanted in a person) but couldn't get themselves concentrated enough for keep the hard on. They still want to keep seeing me and is planning for more dates, kept talking about the future dates (further than 3 months ahead). 

We met on a dating app. We've known each other for a week but every time we met in person (4 times so far), it was always fun (even if it wasn't physical) and we have chemistry. They've told me they really like me and I've told them the same. 

This physical part feels daunting for both of us. They told me physical intimacy is important for them and I'm new to sex but I have been preparing myself for a while. So I agreed we'd only do anything I'm comfortable with but I went with the flow. Whenever we kissed, it just felt right to go further. 

I can't help but feel like I'm not attractive enough for them to want to do it, even if they said I'm stunning and really pretty. I feel like shit. 

I know they say men who have trouble keeping it up are the ones who beat themselves up over it, but I can't help the self-doubt tbh

1719,I feel so ugly after moving to a new country,"I am an asian girl, moved to Europe some years ago. I know every European country is different but I don’t feel comfortable to be specific..


So after coming here, I generally feel invisible. I hardly get approached by a guy, whether it’s party, bar or on dating apps. The number of matches or guys that approach me at bars significantly dropped. I had a few dates on dating apps but that didn’t lead to anything.

Back home, I had no problem dating. I was often called pretty and I also dated Asians and Europeans that I found very attractive. (I think those Europeans were generally interested in Asia and Asians. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in Asia.)

Anyway, here, nobody approaches me. I don’t have typical “hot” asian features (like those influencers - tanned skin etc) I feel like I don’t fit into western beauty standard or western asian beauty standards. 

Even at parties, I feel awkward sometimes. Like people rarely show interest in me even as a person or friend. But my European friends, they always make new friends, get approached at bars often..

I think this made me feel really insecure about myself. I feel like I’m not wanted even though it’s not true. I feel like I’m filtered by race first and by looks again, which makes it worse haha. 

I really have no one to talk about this. People always talk about how asian girls are popular etc, or there are bunch of stories where people feel more attractive when they go abroad. So I feel ashamed that my story is actually the opposite lol.

Because of this, it’s pretty hard to get myself as a person across in a bio, let alone a picture, and because of this they’re really hard to use.

Do women read bios of people they’re not attracted to?

I wish there was a dating app that used a bio as opposed to pics lol.

1723,"I'm 41, I got rejected because I have no experience.","Some backstory for context:

My twenties were the period during which remaining alone while other folks mingled around was the hardest. I didn't stay idle, I worked on myself, met new people, did sports, checked internet for advice and asked my friends for ways to improve. I remained the discreet dude who had very good looking friends.

In my thirties I started to let go of it. Stayed at home more, did the stuff I wanted to do alone, picked   
clothes that were the most comfortable no matter if it made me look worse. If I was to be alone, might as well be comfortable. I had given up on dating at this point. I cooked, did sports, did my things, and it was okay as long as I didn't think about love and people too much. I played with the idea of becoming a sort of hermit, I bought a house that is quite remote, and I can work from home.

I still see the few friends I have from time to time. I'm wondering if they haven't gotten the idea that I   
needed someone, because despite them having families it's like they are inviting me out to things that put me in contact with people instead of the usual dinner with their partner and kids.

Not too long ago, I had a woman ask me out for dinner. I met her through one of the event (a concert) said friends brought me too. First time I ever was invited by a woman, I thought sure, why not. During the evening, we broached the topic of dating, I admitted I never had someone in my life. She never contacted me again. My friends told me I should have kept it for myself, as a lot of people at this age don't want to be ""training wheels"" so to speak, and prefer partners who know what they want and don't want in a relationship.

It convinced me again to let go of the idea of dating and love, but I've been struggling a lot more since   
that evening. I feel like I missed out on a lot in life, and it just makes me sad when I see couples or when friends talk about their relationships, be it in a positive or negative light. I catch myself   
fantasizing about finding love, and I don't like it one bit. I hope it will subside in time.

When I go on dates, I sometimes expect too much (which is my fault :)), but I have noticed dating someone is so emotionally and mentally draining. I don't think I'm built for relationships. I don't plan on having kids (at least biological kids). Sometimes I crave for that physical intimacy to just be in close proximity with a woman. Not really expecting sex here (if it happens, great.

1727,"Is it normal to want to avoid hookup culture and wait for ""the one""?","I'm 19, M and straight if that helps with advice. To start off I've only ever been on dates with different people that only last 2/3 times because I don't really find any romantic connection with them. I'm not someone that's really interested in the whole hookup and online dating culture either so I don't want to fake an emotional connection to win them over or anything like that. To me, I prefer to get to know people in-person before thinking of romance.

To me sex is a very intimate thing that I wouldn't want to share with someone I don't truly love or don't think I'll stay with. Because of this I want to save my virginity for someone I'd plan to stay with for the rest of my life and I'd also prefer that my partner is also a virgin because I'd like to be each other's first and have that stereotypical deep emotional bond. Of course isn't to say that I think people that engage in hookups and one night stands are evil or anything like that and shame them, it's just I'd rather have that kind of deep romantic love between me and my partner. 

I'm not religious or ever have been so I don't really look at sex and dating from a moralistic perspective. I've always been raised in a sex-positive household and my parents wanted me to be aware of ""the birds and the bees"" aswell as informing me about safe sex early on. Within my social circle there are two pretty distinct groups. There's one end that kinds of shames and looks down on me for having this idea of romance and waiting for ""the one"" and essentially tells me to get laid and then my mind would change (obviously it would because I would just be a hypocrite then) and whatnot, and then on the other side there's the more ""incelly"" people that are all about pickup strategies, bascially using women as nothing more than sex toys and so on and try to lump me in with them.

I feel like I've missed out on ""young love"", especially with interference from Covid and it kind of depresses me. I feel like with me holding ideas of romance and true love like this, as I get older, I'm just essentially holding myself back from actually having romantic relationships and partners while my peers advance in that regard but at the same time I don't want to lower my standards and cave to peer pressure because that's not truly how I feel.

I'm just not really sure how to navigate this way. I know online dating is skewed more towards hookup culture and one night stands among the younger generation,  I don't really like how it's bascially the same conversations and icebreaker/pickup lines with everyone which feels fake and manipulative to me. That's why as I said, I prefer to meet people in-person via friends, sports and activity clubs and so on but I'm having a hard time finding someone that even shares the same values as me.

I'm just looking for any advice or thoughts. Are there other people that feel the same way or am I just a moron?  And just to say again, I don't hold anything against anyone that doesn't feel the same way as me, it's just that this is how I feel in regards to romance.",dating

1731,Boyfriend won’t let me come to his apartment,"Me(F21) and my (M22) boyfriend have been dating for 6 months and talking for 8. He comes over to my apartment all the time and spends weekends together but I have never been to his apartment and he won’t let me come over. He lives with his brother and everytime I ask him he says it’s because his brother is studying all day and he doesn’t want to disturb him with us both being there and talking. I asked him if I will ever come over and he says in the future but never when. 

About a month ago him and his brother were sick and I made them food and brought it over, and he met me out front of his apartment complex and wouldn’t let me come in. Which I didn’t care at the time because I thought with them both being sick he didn’t want me to come up and expose myself too much. But, now I’m rethinking that day too.

He has met my family and I have never met his. He won’t even let me meet his brother. I asked if I could meet him and he said yeah but kept coming up with excuses why we couldn’t meet whenever we started to make plans. We have not been dating for that long and this is my first official relationship so I don’t know if I am rushing things. I find it weird he won’t let me come over. Thoughts?

Update:

 hi everyone. I’ve read all the comments and thank you for all your advice. I didn’t see him last night but I messaged him about my feelings about this situation and I feel like we somewhat talked in circles for a long time. 

To clarify both of us are students, so we are both very poor right now so the idea that his parents are paying for his apartment is not weird to me at all and we’ve talked about that because my mother helps with my rent as well. So I feel like it is not that. His parents don’t live in the country, he is an international student so I don’t think it is that he is living with his parents. 

I told him that I just wanted to know the truth despite what it was and that I won’t judge him, because I originally just thought that his place was very messy. He tells me that he does everything at the house, cleaning, cooking, laundry, getting the groceries and from what I believe his brother doesn’t really help him with those things. So the idea that the place is messy is pretty likely if he is doing all the household work for two people while being a student. 

However, I asked him a long time ago that I wanted to come over and he told me later. I didn’t push more than that because I thought if it was just messy he could have time to clean it or whatever. However, it’s been a long time and he still has never let me come over even after that so it makes me suspicious that it is not just a mess. 

I confronted him last night and he didn’t really give an explanation. He said he doesn’t really let anyone over, his friends either. But we are still talking this through. I might go to his apartment to knock, but when I went to visit him when he was sick. He gave me the address with the room number Instead of the number of the apartment complex. So when I went looking for the apartment I was lost and he called me in because I was looking for essentially, a different building. He told me he gave me the room number on accident. So I am thinking of going to that room and knocking. But, I don’t know if that even is the real room number at this point and I don’t want to feel creepy going there. I also can’t get in to the building without being buzzed so I would have to wait for someone else to let me in somehow. 

If he does not tell me what is going on today, I will have to end things. But I will keep you guys updated on what is happening! 

Also someone mentioned if he doesn’t FaceTime you at home that is a red flag. But, we don’t FaceTime or call at all tbh. We mostly text. I also have never met any of his friends, which I didn’t think was super weird because he hasn’t really met any of mine either.  We are both very busy so I respected his space but now looking back I am very suspicious and I feel like an idiot. 

I can post more details about the relationship up to now if you guys would like but I don’t want to bombard you guys with information. Again, thanks for all the advice and I will give an update when I have one!",dating
1732,BF had sex with herpes girl,"New boyfriend revealed one of his exes had genital herpes.

1733,"Never anyones first, second, or third choice…","27f here and Idk what I’m doing wrong but for the ten years I’ve been dating as an adult I’ve only had two relationships. One I was the chaser and the other was with an abusive guy I didn’t love and he was only with me cause he had no where else to go. 

The theme has been seeming to be that I get chosen over, discarded or flat out rejected. I have been single for four years and only get fwb offers. Which I reject. But I somehow always end up in a situation where I have to compete with another woman. 

At some point I want my own person.  Who is solely mine and not have to deal with third parties. I’m a giver sexually. I’m a friend. I try to do right and I take accountability for my actions. I may be a bit blunt and guarded. But anytime I let my guard down I get taken advantage of.Help me figure out what I’m doing wrong please. 

TLDR ; I’m tired of being the second choice or second fiddle as a woman in this dating world.

Edit: spelling

Edit: ok guys I went and edited my profiles. I literally had on there that I was just looking for friends like homeboys or smoke buddys. God big facepalm moment.",dating
1734,How to wipe away my boyfriend's insecurities?,"My boyfriend the other day asked if his dick is small. It's not, absolutely not, it's a good 5.5-6 inches when hard, how on earth is that possibly small? 
I told him no it's not small, that he's a good size and not to worry about it so much.
I assured him that I love his dick, maybe too much, and that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it or him.
He didn't seem satisfied with my answer though, it didn't wipe the worry off his face. 
I've always mentioned to him how I love his dick, that it's good and that he made me fall in love with giving BJ's (something I used to hate before) 
But it still seems that he thinks it's not enough
We have a great sexual compatibility, our libidos match. He's a great and quick learner. Everything is great. And I've made sure to let him know how much I enjoy it. But he's still insecure and I don't know what to do. He's stuck worrying about something that doesn't even matter 
What can I do to help him? I love him so much and I don't want him feeling this way",dating
1735,A guy asked if my bum was nice before going on a date. Should I go on the date?,"I matched with a guy on hinge, we took the conversation over to WhatsApp where we've been messaging casually. we agreed on a date this weekend, but as soon as we'd agreed to it, his next message 'P.s quite forward of me but I’m really curious about your bum, as you can probably tell I’m a bum guy.'

We hadn't even remotely talked about bodies/sex at any point in the conversation and I just felt the timing and the wording of this was all wrong. When I didn't give him a direct answer he called me out saying I still hadn't answered his question. I understand that people have preferences, and sexual preferences and types or whatever. But it came across as really shallow and a bit seedy to ask me to give a review of my own butt.. which faces the opposite way to my own eyes. Sure, you can be curious about what someone is really gonna look like in person/on your first date, but I would draw the line at asking a guy how big his dick is or whether he has abs totally out of context and use that as a basis on whether im going to meet them or not.

Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: Guy asks me (F) f I have a nice bum cos he's a 'bum guy' - BEFORE we have even met. Should I bother meeting him?

EDIT: I cancelled the date, explained the disrespect and blocked him. Thank you all so much for your responses. What an awesome community on here <3 ",dating
1736,Is there actually a way to meet people outside of dating apps?,"All the places people suggests seems so unlikely to actually meet someone who is: Single, attractive, approachable. 

For those of us done with college, it seems like the typical answers are: Meetups, hobbies, coffee places, libraries. It seems like it takes significant luck to meet someone at these places, and when you are forcing yourself to do activities you otherwise wouldn't do, it's even more frustrating. 

Is there any real how outside of dating apps?",dating
1737,$250 on a 6th month anniversary gift?,"One day she told me she wanted to go shopping bc I was supposed to get her a sixth month anniversary present. She keeps adding makeup stuff to the cart saying it's not that expensive, and at checkout it rings up almost $250.

I was expecting her to get me something too, but that didn't happen.

I know that sets me up for failure a lot but good dates stress me out a lot. I get this sick pit in my stomach, the “I’m super afraid to care” feeling.

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy

I’m just tired being hopeful, just to be let down. After a while, it takes a toll on a person. And I think I just reached my breaking point.



Thanks everyone!! I’m fine I was just having a moment and just need to let it out. The reality of this world is, people will use your vulnerability against you. So I don’t really like venting to people, that’s why I came on here lol.

1746,Who pays for dates ?,"Hey guys.

So I am now 29 yo and I’ve never had any success with girls and dating. I am average looking and very easy going.
I lately realized that instead of not getting a chance to date at all (because dating girls of my age does not work) I’ll start dating older women as those tend to like me and some of them are good looking. So I started going out with that mindset and recently met this woman. She is around 40 yo and I like her honestly. Only problem is even after the third date she keeps letting me pay for everything. 
Now I can’t afford to take her on dates because she’s expecting me to pay every time we go out. 
Same thing happened to me few months ago with another older woman. I like to act like a gentleman but clearly I am also an early career man and I am not super rich.
Also, I live in LA if that is relevant. 
Thanks guys!",dating

1748,Friends > dating apps for men,"This is a bit Dating 101 for men. Ignore it if it's not useful for you or you already know it. 

For men it's important to acknowledge that dating apps don't work well for most guys. There are just too many guys using them and not enough women.  80 % of Tinder users are men. And the way the algorithms work can make normal guys almost invisible on the apps. 

Apps work for you? Great. 

But if they don't, put your main focus elsewhere. Try to meet women in real life.  Most people still meet offline and then the most common way is through friends. 

Where do you meet women in real life?

*Clubs and bars. 

This is the Tinder of real life. Too many thirsty guys. 
Some men do well in these settings, but not online. 
But for most guys it can be a hard crowd. 
It's ok to approach women here though, bc people go these places to meet someone. 

*In public. 

No. Don't walk up to strange women. It makes them uncomfortable. 

*In a social setting (through friends, hobbies, activities)

This is different than in public, because people go there to socialize and it's in a context. The friends of your friends are pre-vetted. It's not a potential crazy person approaching you on the street. Psychological research shows it's much easier to fall in love with people we meet in a familiar context. Bc your guard is down. 

*Work

Depends on your workplace culture. Many people meet at work. But it's easy to step wrong here. 

*College. 

Yes. It's a place people go in part bc they want to socialize.  Only works if you are a student there too though. And you still have to make an effort to make new friends and go to social events. 





Takeaway is that expanding your social circle and making more friends is a good idea if you want to meet someone for most guys. 

*How do you expand your social circle?

Join new hobbies, activities. Go to social events with your current friends. Try to get to know new people, both men and women. It doesn't have to be someone you want to date. Could just be someone you have fun with and then invites you to a BBQ where you meet a cute girl. 

*Have a lot of trouble making friends? 

Address that. It can be social anxiety, lack of knowledge of social rules, depression, being on the spectrum etc etc. See a therapist. 
Making friends is like the first battle in a video game. Getting a girlfriend is the boss fight. Dating is a way more socially complex process than just making a new friend. If making friends is too hard, you can't get a girlfriend till you fix that bit. 

*Don't want friends? 

A girlfriend is a very high maintenance friend. You won't enjoy it unless you enjoy talking to people and spending time with them.

*Don't have time for any activities or hobbies?

You won't have time for a girlfriend either. 
A relationship takes up a lot of time and effort. 

*Just want sex, not socializing?

Women are on average way less into sex with strangers than men are. So it's a very skewed marked. Like selling sand in the Sahara. 
I'd guess 5 % of guys can get regular casual sex. The rest can't.  Being like 95 % of men isn't a big deal.

*Should I get a girlfriend just for sex then? 

No. Not worth it and not kind.  It's just way too much work. 95 % of a relationship is just spending time with the other person. It's awesome if you like them, awful if you don't. Instead, do what women do and just invest in sex toys. 

Disclaimer: this is a general advice. Won't apply to all situations, all the time. There are always exceptions. 
But it's mostly common sense.

Edit: some people are bringing up "" don't cold approach wome in public"". To clarify: concerts, a book reading, a festival, a sports contest etc. aren't what I mean. Places people go to be social and where you share common ground, it's perfectly fine to strike up conversation. Museums and book stores, common interest places, can work as well. Just be sensitive to signs of them not wanting to chat.

What I did mean was: don't cold approach women in random public places, like on the street or on the subway. It will usually be a wasted effort and women will often react negatively to it. That's not a reflection of you, but of the cold approach strategy.",dating
1749,Are most people really that shitty at chatting?,"Am I the only one who has so many dull conversations where the girl’s replies are one word or short phrases and she doesn’t ask any questions of her own? 

Like I have to carry the conversation on my back, it’s not natural and there is 0 initiative from their side. I don’t think that’s due to my lack of communication skills. 

I don’t think it’s them replying out of courtesy either. I also had girls text first and then have a dull, robotic conversation. I don’t expect anything out of ordinary. Even hearing a basic question would be nice! 

I talked to a gay friend of mine and he has similar experience with gay men.

Therefore, my question is, are people really that terrible at chatting or they are just not interested? I’d sometimes much rather have them stop replying than have a conversation that leads to nowhere.",dating
1750,"She blocked me after our first date with no warning, Idk how to get over it","I \[M23\] met a girl \[F23\] on Hinge a couple weeks ago. We hit it off really well the entire time on the app, cracking jokes, banter, cool stories and all that. Most of the girls I match with on the app are cool, but she sorta stood out for me based on our convos, and her promptness and jokes made me think she might've felt the same way. Anyways, after a week of exchanging numbers, texting and all that fun stuff, I suggested we meet up on last Thursday to grab cofee. Just a chill meet up, nothing overdone. She enthustiastically agrees and we set a time and place. It's an area close to where I work and also close by where she stays. 

The day of, she got to the cafe before me, and once I got there, I immediately thought ""wow she looks amazing"". I probably stumbled on a few words, but the nerves wore off quickly. We hung out there for a couple hours but it went by fast in my head. We were  talking about our jobs, relatable experiences, funny ass stories, things we want to do. It felt nice connecting with her, the things I don't go deep with my other friends about. Afterwards, we walked through town, kept our convos going, and she showed me spots that I wasn't familair with, mostly because she knew the area really well. At the end, she gave me an intense hug, I hugged her back, and said we'd keep in touch for the upcoming week, and so we left. 

I get home about a half hour later, and I check my phone about an hour later so I could text her about how she was doing. I noticed my text didn't go through, her IG is gone when using my account, and she unmatched me on Hinge. All I have left is her name and number, which I'm blocked on. So, holy shit I have 0 idea what just happened. I've spent the weekend kinda sad about it. I hung with my friends the past couple days but it hasn't distracted me enough from it. I'm sure time helps to get over this, but this one kinda stung. I'm probably not gonna hop on OLD for a while, because I think I really liked her.

1752,Conversation with my Playboy friend,"This is more of a discussion topic. But yesterday I was out with two friends of mine, one who is well known in the friend group as a playboy and a female friend. Now the conversation had gotten to objections and rejections from women and how the objection is a test. He gave an example of a woman telling a guy ""I don't date asian men"" (he's Asian). In this example he would reply with a joke ""Oh thats crazy I don't date asian men either."" 

He explained most men see objections as rejections when we're supposed to see them as problems to solve or an opportunity to turn around the situation and still get a favorable outcome. 

Our female friend had chimed in and agreed with what he said. She said its a way that a woman is using to tell if you will put effort in or see if you will work for her.

 A woman brings up a problem for you to solve in the form of a reason to not date you, and its your job to solve the problem while being witty or funny about it. So I just want people's thoughts on this.",dating

1754,"You’re not special. If someone is willing to cheat with you, they’re willing to cheat on you. Don’t let your ego convince you otherwise.","If someone who’s in a relationship consistently flirts with you, tells you they have feelings for you, or is willing to cheat with you, it’s easy to fall into the ego trap.

You begin to believe that you’re more attractive than who they’re with, or if you hear them complain about their relationship, you’re somehow saving them from a bad relationship. 

However, you’re not special.  You’re just becoming involved with someone who seeks attention and validation, someone who is insecure and deceptive. 

Feeling wanted can sometimes lead to the false perception of feelings, but it’s never a good idea to get involved with anyone who displays these traits. 

You are getting a first hand preview of how they will treat you behind your back if you somehow wind up with them. Make no mistake, if you remove yourself, they will soon interact with someone else in the same way, behind their partner’s back.

Don’t allow yourself to be pulled into this emotional trap. If you meet someone who is in a relationship, and they are obviously disloyal, don’t allow yourself to believe things with you will be different for you. This is the epitome of needy, insecure behavior. If you want a quality relationship, one that’s not rife with drama, then never pursue someone who’s in a relationship.",dating

I know it sounds like I'm a prude, virgin, whatever. Well years ago I was the victim of a SA and honestly I've been coping from it daily. I really like this girl and finally I tell her why I don't really add to conversations when the topic of sex comes up or just not wanting to have sex in general right now. I tell her about my SA and how I do wanna have sex eventually but I just want to get to know them more and trust them more before I guess I feel safe with them.

This was a week ago, I haven't had a single message from them since. I've messaged them twice to see if they're okay. I asked their friend who introduced us if they were all right but now they haven't even gotten back to me.

Yesterday I had a breakdown just thinking about her breaking up with me. And today, my worst fear happened. I'm usually always the one who breaks up first, but not this time. It's unusual for me to get so emotional. 

I did not beg her to stay, I did not ask why. But I did respect her reason, and accepted it. She told me we were still cool and wanted to still talk, but it still hurts to think that she won't look at me the same way she used to. 

Today I learned that nothing lasts forever, and I should let the past go. From now on I'm gonna focus on myself more. 

I don't think I'm gonna get over her for a while though.

1765,Deleted all my dating apps and it forced me to come out of my comfort zone. Just had my best date!,"I (23m) have relied on dating apps for the past several years. I did get dates here and there, some second dates, and some talking stages, but never a full on relationship. This might be due to the fact that I’m pretty introverted and a bit shy, so jumping into dating someone from the get go always felt off for me, but I’ve definitely have gotten better at it.

Recently, about 2 months ago, I decided to delete all of my dating apps for good. I wanted to just forget about these apps, because for the most part they made me too insecure at times. From then on I just focused on doing things I liked and being the best me I can be, which I had already been working on by going to therapy for 2 years (and plenty of other things). 

I like myself, and I stopped feeling the need to impress others. This made me more confident, and I can tell.

On Valentine’s Day I went out of my way to give the cutest girl I ran into a rose (which was given to me). Fortunately I found someone, told them I’d give the rose to the prettiest girl I’d see, and told them I hope they had a good valentines. From there things just went right and we exchanged numbers, right after she gave me 2 big hugs.

Today we just had our first date. I took her out to a cafe, and we found out we like a lot of the same things. Music, clothes, hobbies, interests, and our outlooks on life/dating. I took her walking at a park, which was decorated by pretty lights, and we ended up spending our time at a bench for the last half hour. She held my hands first, while she was telling me stories, and eventually I wrapped my arm around her. Since I’m pretty shy, I felt like this was a bold move, but somehow it just felt right. I would check the time for her since she had class soon, but she literally wanted to stay with me until just minutes before her class started. 

At some point I told her she looked too pretty not to kiss, so i gave her a small peck on cheek. Just a soft cute kiss. She stared in my eyes and gave me a kiss on the lips. I was so excited and surprised I didn’t know how to react. She gave me plenty of more kisses, all while holding my hands and rubbing them.

At the end I took her back to campus, while holding hands, and since class was about to start she just gave me a big hug, and before I could even say anything or go for a kiss she gave me a kiss on the cheek and then another on the lips. 

This was by far the best date I’ve ever been on! Excited where this goes, and I’m happy I pushed myself out of my comfort zone to approach her. I know it’s too soon to say, but I’m having a very good feeling about this :)",dating

1767,Was it just sex?,"Dated this guy- went on 5ish dates. First 2 days were big adventures and were amazing. We’d spend every date night together as well and slept together multiple times. After the 2 dates, it turned into chilled nights at his place and ‘Netflix and chill with Uber eats’ even once when we planned to go to a comedy lounge but he said he’d find tickets but never really did.

 Things were pretty fair paying wise but communication wise I feel i always messaged first after dates. The final date he noticed something wasn’t right and I explained all we did together is sexual stuff, I feel I’m being used. He explained he’d put more effort in and he wanted to see where this was going. Said he’d slacked off but he’d try. 

 I left and decided this ‘date’ (night spent at his) I wouldn’t message first. 3 dates later, still hadn’t heard from him. I sent him a message saying ‘so much for trying’ and he responded with ‘I was going to message you tonight’ and then explained where on different wavelengths when I explained how upset I was with his lack of messaging-  I feel used. 

I liked him but he’d often appeal to me as arrogant, a bit up himself and fancier than I’d ever be. He called me chaotic and surprised I enjoyed cuddling? I’m so confused by it all.

I’ve known her for a year and I finally mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date. I’m picking her up at her place, so I thought it would be a kind gesture to bring her flowers.

I was wondering if it’s too pushy to bring her flowers on a first date. I feel like she would appreciate it but at the same time I’m thinking it’s too forceful.

1776,"SOOOOOOO, I may have met someone organically *not* online dating. I swear it's still possible.","TLDR at the bottom.

So it's probably a little premature for a ""success story"" tag but what the heck.

So I [36m] work part time at an auto parts store that rhymes with ~~$~~. A lady came in the other day asking about coolant for her car because it was overheating. So we're walking back to the coolant section and I don't remember exactly what who said but she expressed *thing one* and I COMPLETELY agree with and wholeheartedly support *thing one*. I told her ""heck yeah"" and fist bumped her. Made a joke about something *thing one* people hear all the time. So anyway, here's the coolant, this is the kind your hot-mobile takes.

Again, I don't remember who said what but she said *thing two* which AGAIN I LOVE AND AGREE WITH. I was like ""wow, what a dope customer"" (to myself) like, the first two things she said were exactly my thoughts too. So I made another joke or two. Really corny jokes because retail customer service. I can't tell the dark dirty twisted stuff to customers.

Again, *something something* and I mentioned something about a big boy internship I'm starting. She said she'd just gotten off from her ""big girl job"" doing *thing three* which is an incredibly important and noble thing that I know exactly 2 things about. 1 she is over worked and over stressed and 2 she is under paid (every ody knows these things about this profession) so I mentioned ""wow that's awesome, like a real helpful thing""

So at this point I started to flirt a little... As much as wouldn't be creepy for a retail sales person. I asked her if she needed advice on the coolant. Went out to her car, showed her where it goes in, gave her the general procedure for filling it. She said thanks, came back in for something else, I flirted a teeny bit more and said ""come back and see us.""

She said ""I will. Btw, my name is K."" I said ""my name is fuck-the-emus"" she shook my hand and left.

I didn't think much of it. I mean, I thought ""that girl was cool AF. Maybe I'll see her again, I hope her car is unreliable""

I got to work today and my coworker said ""hey, that girl you helped with her hot-mobile, she came in yesterday and asked when the next time is you work. She said she was having just an awful day and you totally made her day""

So... TLDR, yes I know how creepy it is to do this but i think in this instance it was well recieved... I flirted with a customer and she came back the next day and asked when I worked again.

1777,"Are women more attracted to ""taken"" guys?","I (38m) went out for a drink with my cousin (25f) to celebrate her submitting her dissertation and catch up. She missed most of her summer studying and all her friends and family are away. I knew she was super stressed so I wanted to cheer her up. I have to point out that I am a man that never gets attention from women.

After we had a few drinks, we were chatting and laughing. She then leans to my ear and tells me that a few women in the bar we were in, were checking me out. When I asked her how she knew, she just said she knows because she is a woman and she knows how women behave.
To prove her point she went to the toilet and I had a discrete look around and I guess she was right. As I have indicated in the past, I don't have much dating experience so again I could be wrong.

Also, I am confident, based on past experiences, that if I was alone or with other guys I wouldn't get any attention, but then again, I could be wrong.

1780,"My boyfriend lost his sex drive, and I can't handle it 😩","Hi there, I'm (F31) feeling really concerned and confused about relationship with my boyfriend (M38). We've been dating for the last 5 years and we live together with our cat and dog. Overall, we have a great relationship, with good jobs, no fights, and we enjoy going on dates, supporting each other, and traveling to new countries. We have very similar sexual needs/libido and had regular sex 3-5 times per week.

Over the last year, our sex life has declined significantly. At first, we were having sex 1-2 times per week, but now it's only once per 1-3 months. I've initiated several conversations about this, but every time I bring it up, my boyfriend says that it's not concerning to him. It started being pretty obvious that Ineededd it more than him. 

We had a fight about it recently, and I opened up about how I don't feel connected, loved, or needed without sex. He told me that he's not concerned about it and doesn't have a physical need. I even asked if he's masturbating, but he said he wasn't. I tried to understand why he doesn't want it anymore, but he didn't say anything. His proposal/fix was to buy a new bed because he doesn't find our current one comfortable to sleep on. Another reason/fix he gave me - to do not let animals in our bedroom.We ended the conversation on a very bad note, because I've got very emotional  - bed is not good 😐 is that a true reason?? We have animals and same bed for the lady 4 years, why wasn't that a problem before?

Today, we're not talking, and he seems angry. He told me yesterday that I keep bringing up the issue, and it's not productive because I don't hear his solutions (I hear just it's doesn't help me understand the reasons).He said he no longer wants to talk about it.

 I'm not sure what to do next. Should we just pretend nothing happened? Should we go to counseling? I'm not sure. I'm worried that there may be nothing left in our relationship, and we're just living like good friends. Alternatively, there may be medical issues that are contributing to our lack of sex, but he doesn't want to hear about low testosterone and probably won't go to the doctor. When I proposed having sex days, he wasn't interested ( I don't want to have sex schedule)

I think we can fix our relationship, but I'm not sure how. When he started saying it was my problem, it brought back memories of other relationships where I was told the same thing. I have a physical reaction to this and feel like running away. Maybe he is not attracted to me anymore? Maybe libido issues? Maybe he is cheating, Idk.

If you have any thoughts or advice for me, please share. Thank you.

Update: 

""These days are very hard for me. We talked, but nothing has changed since our last talk. I started asking when he wanted to shop for the bed, and the answer was, 'I don't know.' I asked, 'Do you know what kind of mattress you would like?' Same thing, 'I'm not sure.' There are more things that I have started noticing. For example, he is avoiding me and trying not to interact much. We went to a breakfast place, and there was a very uncomfortable silence. I tried to start multiple conversations, like where we wanted to go for vacation, but he was not in the mood for any kind of conversation. I think there is something else going on, but I can't figure it out. For now, I will try my best to give him space and see if he will continue being weird. All of my questions like 'Hey, are you okay? Something is bothering you?' have standard answers like 'I'm okay.''""",dating

My other reason is because young children in this era are usually so ill mannered and spoiled.

Edit: I am aware that not every child misbehaves. Children are not the issue. The parents are the issue. If a child has a behavioral issue it’s the parents responsibility to address it. If the parent continuously ignores it, they are the problem. That is a very specific situation but that is why I don’t want to date parents with younger children.

Behavioral issues include: bullying/mistreating other kids. Hitting other people. Bad mouthing adults. Doing whatever they want despite their parent saying no. Doing mean pranks. If those are consistent patterns then the parent is the problem.

In my lived experience, women are the ones who usually bow out with a ""I think you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it"" if things are not heading in a sexual direction around date 3.

As a guy, I typically feel pressured on dates to make moves simply because I don't want to be friend zoned / rejected. It's not that I'm some weird horndog who just wants sex, it's just that I know if it doesn't happen around date 3-4 it'll never happen since she won't want to see me anymore.

I've had great initial sparks that fizzled off if we're not getting sloppy by date 3. I'm totally okay with waiting, as I think most guys are, but we're not given that grace.

In my case it tends to be the complete opposite. The pattern is this: I reach out to men that I want to pursue romantically, they friend-zone me, as a result my pool of friends is mostly men who I've attempted to date but turn into friendships instead.


Is there something deeply wrong with me? I feel my friendships with these men are genuine, but I wouldn't want to put off a potential partner because there are too many men in my life.

Edit: Most comments are saying this is indeed a red flag, due to the apparent risk of me cheating with these male friends who I was once attracted to. I wouldn't cheat, but regardless, a follow-up question:


If hypothetically, I start dating a guy, should I just cut off friendships with my male friends? I would be willing to do so if I felt like the new relationship was really going somewhere serious, but I also wonder if it's worth burning those bridges just for a potential romance that might not even work out.

1800,My friend (25m) who has a crush on me threatens to kill himself every time I (36f) try to end our friendship. How do I get out of this situation?,"I have made a mistake, I'm aware of it, no need to tell me that it's my fault.

I'm    married (36f) and a younger guy (26m) has a crush on me. He keeps    saying that he doesn't, but it's obvious he does, he said he'd date me    if I divorced my husband. We are friends, we became friends last year.     He was/is fun to talk to, but I never considered dating him, I wanted  to be   friends.

I feel genuinely sorry for him, a few days ago he sent me a    picture of a little, lonely bird under the rain and said ''I always  feel   like this. But your friendship makes me smile.''

I    wanted to be a friend and support him, that's why I didn't run away.   But he  got too emotionally attached to me  because I'm caring and  older and now... now I'm stuck. Plus, it's not just a friendship, he  always talks   about how I look like a model (not trying to brag, these are his own words),  he says   he looks at my  pics very often and other things like that.

I've    already tried ending our friendship, but he says ''you're killing    me...'' (he doesn't mean it figuratively, he has suicidal thoughts), so I    decided to stay because I was scared. He's not a burden,  he's   actually  a lot of fun to talk to and I care about him, but this   friendship is  inappropriate for two reasons:

\-    I  have a husband and a 20 year old son (yes, a 20 year old son).   While I  know I'm not cheating, it looks different from the outside.

\-    He's relying on me in a way that it's unhealthy. I tell him to seek    therapy, but he thinks psychologists are useless. He does nothing to    improve his depression. Even if our friendship wasn't inppropriate, I    still wouldn't let him rely on me as much as he does. Again, he's not a  burden, I could let him rely on me forever, that's not the point . The  point  is  that he should be able to be happy with or without me.

Yesterday    I said ''I need a break, maybe even a few months... I need to think    about a few things'', he wasn't overly sad about it because he thinks    we're still friends, he was like ''okay she needs a break, but she's    still in my life. No need to panic.''

What should I do? I feel like I'm stuck.

My husband doesn't know about any of this but not because there's something fishy going on here. My husband trusts me (and rightly so, I've never cheated) and lets me be friends with whoever I want to be friends with as long as I'm faithful. There are other female/male friends he's not aware of, but it's not like  I  hide them because I'm having affairs, I just don't bother telling him. I'm starting to think I should tell him the truth so that he could be prepared in case this guy gets mad and  tries to contact him or whatever.

I had to use a throwaway for obvious reasons.",dating
1801,I have strong feelings for my best friend's mom,"So I (23M) moved cities last year after graduation, for work. A few months later, my friend (23M) told me that his mom (45F) was looking also to move deep into the city for a temporary work gig. She works as an event manager. When I heard she was moving I thought I'd fo a favor to my friend and have her live with me for a while. 

I absolutely fell in love with her. I don't think I've ever had this much connection with any woman. She's the kind of woman who has so much layers to her personality that are all so exciting to navigate. I smile and grin whenever I see her. I can feel some heat between us, which she even acknowledged a bit jokingly. 

She's very caring and loving. We're practically in a relationship since I'm so connected to her. To top it all off, she is incredibly pretty. I really want to be with her. I want it to happen so badly, but of course the ramifications are big. Advice?",dating

But also, can we talk about how even when you are upfront, some people are just super pushy about what they want and will continue to pursue, even if you both want different things? 

It’s definitely been so many times where I’ve let guys know upfront that I want a relationship, while they may want a hookup, and will still try to pursue me, even when the intention and boundary has been set. It just feels like people are more obsessed with the completion of whatever quest they are on, versus respecting when you and another person are simply seeking two different things.",dating
1804,I [F 21] feel men offer fwb with me because I'm not attractive enough for a relationship,"I am in my 20's and I haven't had a real offer for a relationship ever. Men are so quick to offer fwb or casual hookups with me and never ever something serious. It's a little frustrating. Many people say it's because of my age, but I disagree... a lot of these men that offer casual relationships to me are quick to get in relationships with other women or have a dream girl in mind.

&#x200B;

Also before anyone says that they must be attracted to you somewhat or they wouldn't go out with you or make these offers. To that, I say there are many people who have lower standards for fwb and casual relationships. I feel like at most I'm passable looking to most men, but I'm never anyone they would show off.

&#x200B;

It's really frustrating because I've tried dating men who are more similar in attractiveness but they've been the same way. I feel humiliated that I'm not really good enough for anything real. I've been considering cosmetic procedures to improve my appearance. I've been doing all the typical things like working out, taking care of skin and exploring my hobbies more.  I have also upgraded my style and I'm in therapy again. I think at this point it's just how I look.

1805,Is lack of sexual experience a turnoff at my age?,"I am 32M. I havent dated anyone or slept with anyone in years. In fact, early 2016 is the last time I ""got any"".

I don't want to scare anyone off regarding my lack of experience. 

Is my lack of experience at my age a red flag? Or are there women out there who would be ok with this?

My short friends get hit on by cute guys especially cute tall guys. They have boyfriends 5’11” and over. I’ve only had two boyfriends (6ft and 5’7) and both dumped me because they liked petite girls. My first one cheated on me for a petite girl and wasn’t ashamed to kiss her in front of me. He seems happier with her than with me. I’m 5’11” 3/4 (people keep saying 6’0”) and know some guys like taller girls but I think they only say that to make us feel better.,dating

1809,Why would an old hookup reach out after 7 years?,I’m honestly really puzzled why someone should do this. I’m talking about a guy who can get anyone he wants (handsome and famous with a reputation for being a ladies man). After 7 years of no contact (I said no to him last time) he was in my city and wanted to know if I wanted to get a drink. We haven’t been in the same city those full 7 years- that he knows of (I was in his city but I didn’t reach out). We are both married now.

1811,Men on dating apps! Why do you ask this question??,"Hey guys, I’ve noticed almost all of my matches (I’m a straight female so matches are men) ask this question at some point: “so why are you on \[insert dating app\]?”

Why do guys ask this question? Personally I have “looking for a long term relationship, open to short term” on my profile and I thought that would stop this question but it hasn’t. I usually don’t know how to answer other than trying to meet someone who I have a connection with and they always say same. So are you expecting a different answer? How is this question insightful for you? What extra info does it tell you other than what my profile already says?

Tbh, now it feels rude to me and makes me really upset to get it so I’ve been unmatching if they ask it within the first couple messages.

EDIT: “short term relationship” means to me 1-3 years and after your feedback I’ll be updating my profile. -regardless I’d still be getting the question with or without that

**EDIT 2: guys I just double checked my profile and I already had deleted the “short term” thing and I’ve still been getting that question!**

&#x200B;

**FINAL EDIT:**

I’m glad this sparked a lively debate, there’s clearly lots of people on both sides.

 **Heres what’s been commented the most from guys:**

* They just want to hookup and see if that’s what you want too
* They’re trying to have a conversation
* They didn’t read your profile / people lie on their profile
* Seeing if you’re a bot

**Most commented from girls who ask this question:**

* they’re trying to weed out the not serious guys the quickest

So after all this my take away remains the same just a bit less jaded/angry. Guys who ask aren’t worth my time because 1. They just want a hookup or 2. They lack basic conversation skills. 

Fellas I don’t think the question is in your favor since there have been too many times a woman was asked this with just hookup intent so now **the question itself is fully tainted.**

“Why are you single?” and “How’s dating going for you?”

1814,So I asked my girlfriend to shave off her moustache and now she is mad at me. What do I do?,"For context, we have been dating for around 4 months now. She has a little bit of a girlstache and although it has never really bothered me I made the I’ll advised choice of bringing it up with her. I’m not stupid, I knew she wasn’t going to like it when I said it and I more so wanted it to be a playful statement, but it has been a couple weeks since then and she seems really hurt by what I said. I’ve obviously apologized to her and said that I find her so beautiful regardless as to whether she shaves her face. 

I won’t lie though. She has told me on many occasions that she prefers me to be clean shaven. This is something I do not have a problem with. I know it’s different because I am a man she she is a woman, but I still don’t feel like it’s a totally unfair ask. Although I admit I did not go about this properly, I do think that one’s partner can rightly have a say in how the other one grooms themselves. Anyone have any thoughts?

Update: so we talked today about it more in detail and I have her a more full apology saying that I was very inconsiderate of her feelings and how it affects the trust we have for on another. She took it very well and apologized for some of the poor things she said while being mad at me. I’m confident that this has been a learning experience for both of us and will ultimately bring us closer in the end. Thanks to everyone who gave me their thoughts!

As a person who also has no experience, I definitely don't judge women who are in that predicament, but I do wonder if others, regardless of age, have noticed similar patterns and why they think this may be a thing. Is it a function of more short-term relationships and FWB situations? Are people just more concerned with their careers and doing things on their own now?

1821,I think I'm actually the problem,"I've been thinking about my past relationships and how they never really worked out. And you know what? It's all because of me being toxic and emotionally unavailable.

I used to wonder why I always attracted people who were emotionally unavailable or just not a good fit for me, but I finally realized that it's because of my own issues.

Luckily, a friend of mine helped me out and gave me some valuable insights about my personality and behavior. I'm not saying that I'm a bad person, but I'm not as nice or caring as I thought I was.

Now, I'm working on myself and doing some serious self-reflection to figure out my actions and behavior.

And if you're in the same boat as me, and your relationships keep failing or you keep attracting the wrong people, you might want to think about doing some self-reflection too.

1822,I 26m made a mistake during sex and now my girlfriend 29f has been distant.,"I need help. A month ago my girlfriend and I were having sex it was hot and heavy. We were both having a good time.

But disaster struck. I pulled too far out, slipped out, and ended up in the 2nd option. All in one go. It was 100% an accident. We both grabbed for it and when I went forward it happened. She screamed and started crying. I was freakingout worried and trying to do all I can to help while apologizing.

I have apologized multiple times and tried to do anything I could think of to try to help her and make her comfortable. She knows it was an accident.

But since then she has been not as close to me as we were. She barely engages with me. The most she would cuddle up to me(which happened yesterday for the first time since). I'm being respectful and not pushing her for anything. She doesn't kiss me or in general, flirted with me since the incident. We were always hands and flirtatious towards each other. I don't want to keep bringing it up.

What can I do? Has this happened to anyone else? I feel like I violated her and now I feel like I SAed her and now she sees me as such. I feel like I'm dirty and that I now repulse her. I love her but this is starting to hurt and I fear we won't be able to move on.

We have been together for 1.5 years. But I have known her most of my life. To my knowledge, she has never expressed past trauma to me. We have done it in the past and are open-minded in the bedroom. She is not cheating or anything because I know people will say that.",dating

I can almost depend on hearing from him throughout the day. We’ve had two dates that ended up being sleepovers, which I didn’t regret until now because it felt right. Yesterday morning I texted him good morning and wishing him a great day. He never responded. I was so confused, again, because things were going well. I texted him again this morning, over 24 hours later, and he said. “Thank you. I’m happy to hear from you.” And I responded, “huh?” To which he said this: 

“This is going to sound some type of way, but I had to be sure. We’ve gotten to a point where I wanted to see if I was wasting my time or not. I needed to know that if I hadn’t said anything, you wouldn’t have just never tried again. Because if yesterday would’ve been the last time you tried talking to me, I would’ve known you didn’t actually care. I apologize for testing you, but again I needed to be sure. I’m very happy to hear from you”

We’re both almost 30 and at decent places in life. I’ve just gotten to a place where I’m happy again after depression and I’m not gonna lie… this gave me anxiety and uneasiness. I don’t think something meant for me should make my stomach turn.

I met this woman at a coffee shop and asked her out to some ice cream. She agreed and we exchanged numbers.

I was setting up the time and place of the date via text. We agreed to a time in the evening the next day where it would work for us. She asks me did I want to meet her there at the ice cream parlor, which I figured was implying if I wanted to ride together or not. I decided to meet her there just in case things didn’t work out and I didn’t want to have an awkward ride back in the same car lol.

The day of the date comes and I’m waiting for her in the ice cream place. She arrives and gives me a pretty big embracing hug, and we ended up getting our ice cream and went to find somewhere to sit.

So the conversation seems to flow effortlessly, talking about careers, fun stuff we did, etc. At one point, she asks me how old I am and I jokingly say I’m 62(I’m 30). She play along and says “wow you look so good for 62. What’s your secret?” I say it’s sunscreen and just taking care of myself. She then proceeds to say “I need to get some tips so I can stay young and sexy like you”. That made me think this was going pretty well.

We continue talking and at one point she brings up that she went to school in Germany for most of her life. At that point, she shares differences between living in America and Germany. I then ask her was was dating like in Germany. She then says “Well it’s…… I have a boyfriend…I’m sorry”.

I was so confused by what just happened. She then proceeds to answer my question like she didn’t just that bomb in front of me. I didn’t even register anything she said because I was still trying to process what just happened. When she was done answering, then ask her for clarification, “So is it an open relationship or something?” And she goes “No, it actually pretty serious.”at this point it was probably clear I was upset. She says “I’m sorry. I should’ve said something”. I then say “Yeah you should have” and walked out if the date.

I drove home still trying to process what happened. Was it not clear that I wanted a date? Did I misread her actions as interest? How can I be more clear in showing my intentions so something like this doesn’t happen next time? I’m a late bloomer when it comes to dating so there are some things I’m still learning.",dating

I hadn't made a move up until this point and was worried she would start to think I'm not interested if I didn't do something soon. So, during the movie I saw she was getting emotional at some of the sad scenes. I put my hand out and gestured for her to hold it, but she put it back on my armrest. Embarrassed, I apologised.

Dating just seemed a little messed up at that point and I didn't feel it was fair for either party involved, so I bit the bullet and did a whole lot of self-work.

Fast forward to last weekend, after a whole lot of soul-searching and even more therapy, I finally mustered up the courage to get back out there. I met up for drinks with a girl I met on bumble, and it was great! At least, I'm pretty sure, she said she was up for a second date at the end of the night, but then texted me a few days later saying she's still working through some trauma from her last relationship and far be it from me to fault her for that. Worst case scenario, she was nice enough to lie to me to not hurt my feelings, but that's not the point.

And this includes women who have already demonstrated that they have trauma or other mental issues.

Women of reddit...what's the deal? Are these women looking for someone perfect to fix them? Because that's not how it works. And I have tried telling women I am working on these things...same response.

1842,Why do some women do this on dating apps?,"So I've been on dating apps for a while and noticed that, depending on the city, you'll usually find 10-25% of women whose bio states little more than some of the following quotes:

""Entertain me.""

""Spoil me.""

""Make me laugh.""

""Don't be boring.""

Etc.

I have my own thoughts on why these women do this, but I want to ask women specifically to get their perspective. I'm curious just because there's such a large percentage of women like this, and it would be extra helpful to hear from those who actually post things like this on their bio.",dating

1844,I think I have a better understanding of how women feel on online dating platforms now,"&#x200B;

TL;DR  I signed up as a girl to hookup site and was astonished by the over saturation and creepiness of guys.

I'm  a guy in my late twenties and I did something I'm not very proud of and signed up for hookup site. I got a handful of messages from girls but they all seem like they were auto generated so I decided to check further. I made a new account this time as a girl in her late twenties  and had an AI generated picture as my profile. During this experiment I  found out a few interesting things:

1. If you're a girl you don't pay to be able to chat on the site
2. There is a checkbox where as a girl you can select to automatically send a message to a guy that matches your criteria
3. Guys suck at taking dick pics
4. The  shear amount of messages I got the second I created my profile was  astronomical. I didn't even get to confirm my email and I already had  like 30 messages from horny dudes and of course like 75% of them were  accompanied with a dick pick. If I had kept my profile for a day I would  probably get hundreds if not close to 1000 messages.
5. Some guys straight up offered to pay me to hookup with them. (why won't they get prostitute at that point? oh yeah prostitution is illegal here...makes sense).

I  repeated the experiment without a profile photo on the same site and on 2 other sites with similar results so I guess it doesn't even matter  how the girl looks as long as she is breathing and exists on the site.

Overall  this little experiment showed me how over-saturated with guys these  sites really are and I think it won't be far fetched to say that dating  apps like OKcupid, tinder and bumble are probably similar. Girls are  probably overwhelmed by the amount of guys which either drives them off  the platform or makes them extremely picky.

In  conclusion I'm staying out of hookup sites since they are hopeless and  probably dropping dating apps as well. Going old school.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

1845,"The guy I’m dating has a small penis, and I don’t know how to move forward…","(24f) (28m) Hello everyone. So for the past month I’ve been dating this guy. He’s great in every ways he’s sweet, kind, funny, understanding, has a good job, etc. I wanted to take our relationship slow so I made it a point to take things slow. Well last night he spent the night and we became sexual for the first time. We DID NOT have sex. He ate me out (which was amazing) and we made out. Well while we were making out I tried grabbing him down there and I didn’t really feel anything. When we were done kissing, he asked me to watch him play with himself (which I’m 100% into) and when he took out his penis I was taken back by how small it was. Like it was so small. 
I don’t have anything against men with small penises and I don’t believe in body shaming. However, I would prefer at least an average size penis. It is as so small when he tried to stick it in, it kept slipping out. Tbh it was such a turn off. I told him that it was fine and we could just go to sleep. The rest of the night and the next day was normal. I acted like nothing happened. I want to continue to date him but I keep thinking long term. It’s really important to me to be with someone that I want ti have add with. But I just do not like small penises at all. Is there a way that maybe I can work on this? He’s a great guy and I want to continue to get to know him.",dating

1851,"If your best advice is always ""go to the gym,"" please stop.","I promise you we get it. Going to the gym helps people get in better shape, be more confident, whatever.

But please. PLEASE. Stop using it as a one size fits all solution to anyone's, particularly men's woes. 

You can go to the gym all you want if you're feeling sad, lonely, confused, whatever. You may get in better shape, sure, but you can still be sad, lonely, confused, etc. You'll be just in better shape with those same issues.

I am not discouraging anyone from working out. I never will. I will always support self-improvement. However, if you go to the gym thinking that lifting weights will magically erase your problems and you push that same thinking onto other people whenever they express their troubles, you're not helping. You're just reinforcing this weird logic that running away from your problems and redirecting your energy is equal to working through them in an actually effective way.

Yes, it's great to get into better shape and to dive headfirst into your interests and things you care about, but self-improvement and sad thoughts are not mutually exclusive. Life is not a constant tug of war between self-improvement and feeling sad and lonely. You can be on the path to self-improvement and still feel sad and lonely and hopeless the moment you leave that gym.

If you're struggling with dating and it's taking a serious mental toll on you, talk to whomever you can confide in and try to get to the bottom of things. Take time to sit in thought and figure out the root of your troubles. Lifting weights alone will not rescue you from your deeper problems.

This is a first for me being rejected because I don’t drink. I still go out to bars, clubs and music festivals. I don’t mind being around it.

1863,He(33M) has been so good to me and things have been amazing but I(27F) might end it.,"We’ve been dating for a little over 3 months now. It hasn’t exactly been exclusive but things have gotten much deeper than we anticipated. We have such a good connection and it’s been unlike anything either of us have ever had. We’ve spoken about what we want in the future as individuals and even discussed what a shared future might look like. He has also expressed that he has no desire to be with anyone else now… but my situation has changed. One of my siblings passed away and I will be taking in her son(4) and becoming his legal guardian. 

To my surprise he didn’t waver. Instead he sent flowers, has texted me everyday since to check in and see if I or my nephew need anything and has even come over to either console me or just spend time with me. Regardless, I know what he wants for himself and I don’t want him to compromise any of that for me. So, I’ve been thinking about ending things or reducing things to friendship. I have a lot on my mind right now so maybe I shouldn’t make any hasty decisions. But this is a pretty big hurdle so early on… I just don’t want to continue for him to either decide that he doesn’t want this or for him to be apart of our lives and potentially regret it. Should I ask for a break so he has time to really think about what he wants going forward? Am I overthinking? What are your thoughts? I need outside opinions.


Edit: Thank you everyone for the feedback! I really appreciate you all for calling me an idiot in the gentlest ways lol.

1865,Success!!!!🤣🤣🤣,"So... Hey guys. I'm done pouting about it, now I think it's a great story to share here! In summary, the dating world is bullshit. Kinda.

I (20M) met this girl at a bar. Our group is both different leagues of a huge citywide casual sports conglomerate. She introduced herself and somehow I got pulled into a round of flip cup standing right next to her. We seemed to have pretty good chemistry, started talking about our favorite movie characters pretty much. I was wearing my favorite leather blazer that she said made me look like Star Lord. I called her Zendaya and asked for her autograph.

I thought I felt some chemistry, so at a later part of the night I saw her, came up and asked if I could get her number. Success! And she said ok. And I'm just there dumbfounded like well that was unexpected

Later I was getting my bike unlocked in front of the bar. Dressed per usual with the leather blazer, speaker backpack, and the black motorcycle helmet, feeling pretty good about things, and she comes out, and being somewhat drunk I expect she's with her group of friends and right there on the sidewalk not feet away from me she says, ""Star Lord asked for my number! And I was thinking should I say no? Should I fake it? He was a bit much to be honest. But I gave it to him."" Something like that.

And I'm like, you realize I'm right here.

The second mindset is all about a guy being persistent. If he really likes you, he'll keep chasing you even after you say no. If he gives up too easily, then he's not the one for you. Some women really believe this, and I think it's part of why some guys can't handle rejection. They think the woman is just playing hard to get.

They never feel the same way and we typically stop talking to one another. The sadness of losing a friend/crush is exacerbated by my tendency to get overly attached to people. Too early and you scare people off when you’ve only seen them a few times and ur trying to make it clear that you’re looking for something long term. I would call myself a hopeless romantic, but there haven’t really been the most opportunities in my life for me to practice romance. I just know I want to fall in love with somebody lol.

1882,Only 12% of people on dating apps find their life partner...,"I just read that only 12% of people who meet on dating apps actually become life partners. I was blown away with that information. Even if it's not 12% precisely, let's say between 10 and 20, that's still a really low amount and I can why there's so many people feeling exhausted, jaded and tired from dating.

I also felt some sort of relief as well I guess? Like all these guys I've met who I enjoyed their company ditched me for their ""endless options"" expecting to find ""the one"" when in reality it's not easy to find someone you connect with. I find it rather funny and sad at the same time.

At the same time though I have probably been on more than 100 dates no joke and by now I might have surpassed the statistic and mathematically speaking should've already found someone.

The whole thing is so weird and at this point I honestly think that it's pointless trying to date. I live in such a big city and yet seems everyone is so disconnected.",dating
1883,"Dating App Fatigue, anyone else?","I’ve been on the dating apps like tinder, hinge, and bumble, and to be honest I think it’s about time I take a real break. Swiping and having conversations that go nowhere with alot of people over time really makes you question if these apps are worth the effort. 

These dating apps expose you to people you probably would not have had the chance to meet otherwise, but I feel that with the abundance of “choices” it gives people the false idea that there’s ALWAYS another person in line. I feel because of this idea the following happens:

-people ghost more frequently
-people think there’s always someone new and better, making comparisons always and looking at the green grass on the other side
-makes dating superficial 

To be fair, I had a girlfriend because of tinder before, but that was few and far in between and the effort isn’t worth it to me anymore as I mature and know my time is worth more elsewhere, but that’s just me.

If they are having enough of a trust issue that they have to post him to a group full of random strangers, then why are they in a relationship?

i personally feel like situationships are for people who are in it for the thrill and just dont want to commit. whether they have good intentions or not, it is not healthy. there is no responsibility involved and people will always end up getting hurt. i have been on both ends of a situationship, and it doesnt feel great either way. the guilt and hurt is insane.

to ""commit"" to someone and become so intimate with them, and then just lose it in a day is rlly sad. 

i dont have a conclusion to this, i just feel like this generation is really in a bad place. it's extremely sad to see this generation seeking temporary intimacy and affection in sometimes not so good places.

The only issue is that she’s absolutely terrible at giving oral. She’s eager to do it but when she does, I can’t help but start going soft. I then have to go into having sex because I feel like going completely soft might rattle her confidence. I haven’t been able to go longer than a minute before telling her to switch. 

I want to be able to talk through it and tell her that there’s room for improvement but also don’t want to ruin her confidence or make her feel bad. She’s otherwise good in bed.

Once I drove 30 miles just to drop off dinner and went to the store to buy a guy medicine because he was sick and we were dating. I would always buy food or snacks and invest my time in our dates, long phone calls, texting everyday. Because we agreed we were interested in each other. Turns out he was still talking to other women from dating sites. Well waste of time. Dropped.

Going on another date. First date spilt the bill, second date. I pulled out my card and he was just waiting there. Did not get a single thank you. That was automatic drop.

Investing my time and energy. At this point investing in my own self care aka sex toys.

1897,Suddenly find out she's dating another guy,"Need some opinions here. I've been dating a girl for about 2-3 months, both aged 39, divorced with a few kids. We've been spending a 1-2 nights a week at each others houses (when kids aren't there), hang out at bars, have fun and just chilling. We also go unprotected. We text each other every day, long phone calls. Pretty much a relationship, but neither of us are looking at more kids or getting married. We share the little mundane details about our days and drama's with our exes etc. We've been having very deep emotional conversations too and what we've learned from our breakups/therapy. Both of us are busy professionals

Recently she's told me that we never had the relationship chat (we didn't) and she's been dating another guy, she mentioned that she's been doing the same with him, as with me. Texting, hanging out, sex etc, she didn't think it was relevant as we weren't in a relationship.

I immediately just calmly said I'm out, I don't want to spend this much time on someone for just sex. I thought to myself that I can ""legally hire"" just sex for a lot less and my thoughts are that if she's investing this emotion in another guy, it can't be that serious with me. I don't want to be a backup plan. She didn't respond well at all to the break up, saying I was gaslighting her - being insecure - when I said I didn't mind what she did, no stress - it just didn't fit what I was after. She was possibly hoping to make me jealous. Maybe to commit.

What are your thoughts? Is this normal now? Am I being the jerk here? It just doesn't sit well with me, even if it didn't technically break a ""monogamous relationship pact"".",dating
1898,To women: Why a lot of men like coffee dates,"We generally ask for coffee dates not to be cheap. But because in the time of dating apps you're not meeting people in person and in person attraction is very different then seeing pictures online. 

For example, I have gone on so many first dates ove the course of my life and spent so much money on first dates with women who don't find me attractive. I wanted to see them again but they weren't interested, and thats disappointing but fine, they don't have to like me, but for me, thats just my money down the drain. I'm not whining because it's money I had, I didn't overextend myself, but it's frustrating to go on first date after first date spend your hard earned dollars on women who aren't interested in you she gets a free date and goes about her life having rejected me, I get nothing from that experience, except money spent. It's not that I need to ask her to split it, if she's interested I don't want her to pay for the date, the issue is always if I'm interested and she's not then as a man who took her out to get to more dates with her then I gain nothing from this interaction.

I love coffee dates because if after meeting me there isn't a connection ok no problem I spent $20 bucks on a couple of coffees at least I feel better about the rejection. And if she is interested in going on a actual date, great, now I feel more confident that there's an interest there and I'm down to spend more money.

This is something women just don't understand. It's not always that guys are broke and cheap we just want to spend money on women who want us, if I meet a woman at a bar I wouldn't ask her on a coffee date, I only do that with women I meet on dating apps.

All we ask as that women see it from our POV",dating
1899,Dating is exhausting - until it isn't,"From my experience I thought of dating as this labourius process of awkwardly making conversation with an endless stream of strangers. 

And to large extent it is. There's a lot of people you just don't have that chemistry with. I thought that was the best I could hope for so I kept trying to make that work.

But then I met someone who I immediately hit it of with. 3 hours went by in the blink of an eye and we have a dinner date next week. Said dinner date was planed while we were still at the cafe! BaD IdEa right? Not if you're both really into eachother.

When it works, it's easy, fun and you can break all the ""rules."" So don't try to force it if you don't feel the spark, just move on. I know it's hard to keep going sometimes and it is exhausting. But you never know when the very next date will hit the sweet spot.

Edit - Thanks for words of wisdom everyone. I know I should temper my enthusiasm and keep my feet on the ground. A great start doesn't guarantee anything.

It's just hard not to get a little excited after a long stretch of medicore-at-best dates. Hopefully it goes well here on out!

1900,Girlfriend gift unappreciated,"BF (23) here.

I gave my GF (23) a new iPhone 14 for her birthday. Her reaction to the gift was unexpected. Maybe I’m expecting too much. 

I surprised her in a very creative elaborative way. She wasn’t shocked. She wasn’t overly grateful. She just said thank you after I asked her a few times on her thoughts on it. I’ve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way). In this scenario, I got none of that reaction. 

In fact I gifted it to her after picking her up from the train station and I got little to no reaction. I made an elaborate plan. I’d pick her up from the train. Her brother using the IMEI number would activate the phone and I’d call her #. Her new phone would ring instead of the old one. She just wasn’t moved by it. It didn’t phase her. No reaction at all. 

I’m hurt for two reasons. It was expensive and I expected more from her. Two, my family were all supportive of this gift and asked me about her reaction. I lied to them to make my gf look good and said she was shocked, astonished etc when In reality, her feelings towards it were subpar.


We are less than 1 year In and I’ve given her other things. Her parents visited her at her apartment the other day and they asked about those new gadgets IE tv, computer + hardware. She lied to them and said she bought it even though she’s a student (can’t afford it) instead of saying I bought it. 

Am I missing anything? I’m just really disappointed and upset.

I’m so scared of catching something and almost to the point of paranoia.  I always ask people’s status, but I’m not sure if that’s enough.  What do you do?  

Guys - what tips can you give girls to protect themselves?

Edit 1:  thanks for all the comments.  I’m glad we can have a civil conversation about it.  

I first would like to apologize if I offended anyone by using “clean” bc I didn’t mean it in a derogatory way, but rather as a synonym for someone who has an STI/STD.  So I’m really sorry for my unintentional ignorance.  

Secondly, I work in the medical field so I always see the “exceptions”.  Yes, part of my fear is irrational, I will be the first to admit.  But part of it is also based on science.  Testing and using condoms are definitely good tips.  However, you can get STIs (eg HSV, syphilis) from kissing or vaginal oral.  Unless you use a barrier, you’re exposing yourself.  Another thing people don’t realize is timing is different for every STI/STD.  It takes a while for tests to pickup certain diseases and infections.  People think get tested one day after they sleep with someone or get tested then sleep with another that same night may very well think they’re negative when in fact they’re not and can spread.  

Last comment - your loins do not communicate well with your brain.  That means that in the heat of passion or when you get along great with someone, the least romantic thing to bring up is STDs.  It’s always so awkward and men always pressure u to have condomless sex bc it doesn’t feel good or I’m being paranoid.  That’s real life.

1908,PSA; Don't be this guy,"Its a nice summer night in the city and my boyfriend just took off with his friends to hit the mountain bike trails for the evening. Most of our friends are either attending weddings or enjoying their long overdue, postponed vacation plans. For the first time in a while I realized I had a full evening to myself without anyone to worry about except ME. Back when I was single I used to love decompressing by going to the coffee shop on my own, or a nice restaurant to treat myself while reading a book. Over the pandemic it was a ritual I lost sight of and I felt excited to get out there.  It was too nice to stay indoors so I packed up my bag with a book, a blanket and a couple drinks, and placed a takeout order at the new sandwich shop i'd been meaning to try.

As I sat in their vestibule waiting for staff to finish prepping my sandwich, I became immersed in the first couple pages of my book. Eventually I looked up and was startled to see another patron had come in, sat down in the waiting area, and was staring directly at me. He smiled a bit when I made eye contact, and I smiled back. Something about his demeanor struck me as being a little bit off. He didn't blink much so his stare felt really intense and he had a very nervous disposition about him and was wringing his hands a little. He asked me what I was reading and for the next 30 seconds we made very painful, awkward small talk about the author of the book. We sat awkward and silent for a moment or two before the server came out with my dinner. I went to wish them both a good night and he cut me off rather abruptly and awkward said ""Can i get your number?"". I've never seen a server vanish so quickly in all my life.I smiled politely, pushing the door open to leave while saying as pleasantly as I could ""I'm sorry, I'm actually in a serious relationship, I'm flattered, but I hope you have a nice evening"".

Those situations don't happen to me very often... maybe a handful of times in my early twenties, but at 30 I've only had one other person do a cold approach on me before. It's awkward and I hate making people feel badly when its not reciprocal.

Across the street there is a big park with lots of green space, live music and sports activities going on. I lay my blanket down and started applying sunscreen. The atmosphere was really light and there were so many people out enjoying the sunshine. I opened up my sandwich and started to read, the sunshine was warm on my back.

Suddenly someone crouched down next to me, and said ""hey."" and it startled me so bad that I ended up spilling my open can of sanpellegrino all over the blanket. When I looked up I noticed it was the guy from the sandwich shop. He had lost his awkward disposition and appeared to be genuinely angry. He let out a frustrated sigh and said, rather icily...

""So explain to me why you are eating dinner.. ALONE... in the park if you have a boyfriend""

""Excuse me?""

""Oh i'm sorry if I made you feel awkward by calling you out on it, but it just doesn't make any sense to me, and if it doesn't make sense, it's a lie. So why lie about it? Do you realize how hurtful that is?""

""I didn't lie about it, I do have a boyfriend""

He rolls his eyes.

""Right. Sure. What is it with girls like you, you don't have the time to be choosy... you are well past your prime at this point.""

For some reason this remark automatically caused me to flush with embarrassment. This seemed to catch the ear of the elderly couple in front of me who was sitting on a park bench.

""Whether or not i'm lying doesn't give you licence to come up and hassle me for not giving you my number. Go away""

He started to address my lack of integrity when the woman from the park bench, who was probably a few inches shorter than me, came marching up with her husband close behind her

""hey, beat it."" she said.

""she's not interested pal, let her enjoy her dinner"" the husband said, closely behind her

Without a word the guy took off. Swinging his takeout bag of food. I thanked the couple, who gave me a small pep  talk (and told me about an outdoor store where I could buy a little whistle from and keep it in my purse, which was sweet of them). They left and I tried to get back to my book but by that point the warmth of the sunshine seemed less soothing and I felt a bit embarrassed and unsettled... so I packed up and went home to lay on the couch watching Ru Pauls drag race until my boyfriend got home.

Rejection sucks. I get it. So does loneliness. The dating world isn't an easy place, and its important to try to be kind to each other, but some people simply don't know how to regulate their own emotions. So stay safe out there and don't let anyone push you around.",dating

1910,A little life advice from your friendly old swamp witch,"1: Never try to find in a new relationship what you had or felt in a previous one. Love is never the same. 

2: Very rarely will someone check off all your boxes. We have social circles to fill in some of those needs. The internet has given the illusion that there is an endless source of people to choose from, and it's a lie. 

3: If you find yourself growing bitter towards dating or the dating pool of your preference, it's time to step away and reflect on yourself. Falling in love requires a certain naivete and trust, and if you lose that you are only hurting yourself and others trying to use them to ""fix"" it.

UPDATE:

Thank you to everyone that has commented on this post. This girl was my long term crush since high school and I was very excited to reconnect with her and potentially have a future with her.

I cut her off about a month into us reconnecting a few months ago. We fucked a few times but I couldn’t bear to have a future with someone like this. We talked but never dated. 

I just needed to know that I really did the right thing. 

She was THE person I thought about when it came to who I wanted to be with for the past few years. I worked on myself for years to get the courage to try being with her and I’m disappointed that she’s not who I thought she was. She’s blocked and I will never talk to her again.

I’ve learned an important lesson: 
Looks are not everything. Character is what matters most.

1915,I asked my bf for a break and he’s not answering at all,"Im (18F) met my bf(19M) at april  and since the beginning of our relationship i noticed the lack of efforts from him but i was okay with it because i didnt want to lose him since he was my first love  but still tried to communicate it with him which will end up with im trying or thats me accept me the way i am , but with after time it was hard specially that he’s not even doing the bare minimum so i asked for a break up after that he left me while i was crying to him about how much it hurts me to feel like im not a priority to him when he got a call from a friend of his .
 after 3 months he asked me back and i had hope that he changed that time and gave him another chance but sadly it happened again and i tried to communicate and still nothing changed so i asked for a week break cause i wasn’t feeling okay mentally and felt like everything was repeating itself and now its been 13 days he’s not picking my messages at all and not even trying to talk no matter how i spammed messages and calls i asked his friend and he told me thats he was out with him yesterday and everything was good now i dont know what to do and if i should count myself single or not

1918,"A girl I’ve been dating almost exclusively has only guy friends, some were former friends with benefits","I’m dating a girl that almost exclusively has guy friends. I’ve read mixed opinions on whether this could be a red flag. 

Here’s the kicker though. One of her closest guy friends whom she sees often for lunch or dinner, I found out recently was also a former friend with benefits. Now, I’m not one to tell people what to do, that’s their deal. However, when this came out, she said they slept together once long ago. No biggy, then a few weeks later it surfaced that it was actually a regular thing for 2 years. 

Normally this wouldn’t bother me but I began to wonder why she changed the story rather than just say so In the first place. So, I asked her why. Then it went back to oh actually I think it was just a few times.. and so on. 

I’ve always believed couples shouldn’t keep separate circles of friends but she always has a reason why we can’t yet all hang out together and we’ll have been dating for around 6 months now.  

She’ll say things like, “just because he’s a guy doesn’t mean there’s anything to worry about. You wouldn’t be worried if it was a girl would you?”

I remind her that this is different in my opinion in that she banged the dude casually for a while and I haven’t even met him.

This is really just for venting, it's not about asking for advice, it's just to vent at how shitty the whole online dating thing is.

In the past few months I've been improving a lot of aspects of my life. I got very fit, I am generally much happier at work and socially, and I even got a revamped wardrobe. I managed to get my friends to take GREAT pics of me, everyone so far (even strangers whom I asked for ratings) have told me these pics look amazing. I even had people message me after months of not doing it just to tell me ""hey I love your new profile pic!""

I also have a pretty good bio which has gathered really good feedback, it showcases my interests, it shows I'm active, passionate, that I like to listen, and it has ZERO controversial statements. Not even claiming which ice cream flavor is better.

And I still get barely any matches. In around 1 month of being back in dating apps, I've had 3 likes in Okcupid, 1 on Bumble, 1 on tinder (never replied) and 3 on Feeld.

A lot of people just say ""oh it must be your bio...it must be your pics"", we all know thats not true, the real reason is simply that men outnumber women in these apps like 2:1 or even more, so most women don't really have the need to swipe on me if I'm a 7 or even 8, because they already have a bunch of >9 going after them. I don't blame women for it, I would do the same, just venting because the system sucks.",dating
1920,I used prostitutes in the past am I undateable?,"So a bit of back story. I was abused as a kid. Nearly murdered. Family nearly killed each other. Broken family. Not looking for sympathy.

Prostitution is legal here and I did talk with the women and they were doing it out of choice.

Times and fortunes changed. I worked on my mental health. Started working and having stability in my life. I feel at some point I might have fixed myself enough to be in a relationship, but with this stain i feel fear about telling a potential partner.

Has anyone been in this situation before and what did u do?

Edit: i think she does truly like me because when i asked her out she was so happy and excited. She told me she got the butterfly feelings. She told me ppl have asked her out before and she never told ppl about it but apparently when i asked her out she was so excited and happy that she told one of her friends about it

She is in a rough situation right now. A lot of stuff is going in her personal life and that's another reason she told me she doesn't want to date. I told her i want to be there for her and support her but she said it's not fair for me or to herself if she dates me

So all her exes were friends and she just loss all those friends when they broke up and she told me if she dates me and the chance it doesn't work out it won't be the same. She straight up told me when u become physical with someone and u see them naked when u become friends again it's just awkward and not the same

Edit 2: she also mentioned to me she needs to work on herself. She did recently breakup and she knows that she shouldn't even date for awhile which is understandable but she also mentioned that she can't date any close friends anymore because she can't afford to lose anymore friends

Edit 3: it's really tough because the things we do right now is basically dating that's why i want to date her. We hangout 1 on 1, she calls me almost everyday. We literally are technically dating besides the physical aspect. I've even asked her if she does this with other ppl and she said no. She is very weird to me because she is completely ok with me dating another girl in fact she encouraged it and told me it prob make it easier but i know if i date another girl my future girl wont be that ok with me being that close with my friend so in the end i'll prob have to distance myself

Forgot to mention that for my sake we agreed no contact for 2 weeks. Even though she expressed to me she is not happy about this she really cares about me and she said if that's what i want then she will go through with it",dating

Anyway, I meet up with him and say my
 peace, he says he was kinda on the same page, ended amicably although a bit awkward. 5 mins after I leave, I get a text saying that “it’s annoying that you dragged it out and felt the need to have that conversation in person” and “that a clean break really doesn’t need an in person date in my opinion.”

I’m just discouraged. I went out of my way to try and do what I thought was the right and respectful thing, and he apparently wanted it in a text. 

I’ve got to get a thicker skin for dating.

I’ve even brought it up before ( I believe you shouldn’t expect people to read your mind what your needs are) and they respond with something along the lines of “oh it just doesn’t occur to me to say it. I THINK it but I just don’t say it.” That’s complete BS because they did the first date or two or always before sex at least. Even after I bring it up, they continue to avoid complimenting. I think if it stops occurring to them to say it means they are already starting to take you for granted, want to keep you insecure, and/or don’t care about your feelings. FYI, I always compliment the guys, so I’m not being sexist that only guys have to one to compliment and the fact that it doesn’t occur to them after I compliment themis a little suspicious.",dating

1941,I left a date early because of red flags and I feel awful.,"I (26M) went on a second date with (24F) and it was the worst “date” I’ve ever been on, but still feel awful for leaving early. 

Met her on Facebook dating, which I’ve honestly met some really nice people and even though they didn’t lead to any kind of relationship, I’m happy I met them. 

We talked on the phone for an hour and forty five minutes a couple of days after matching. During that talk, I got a couple of red flags. I thought that since I didn’t know her, maybe I’m just being apprehensive and judgmental. 

* Drives a car without it being registered
* 99% sure she doesn’t drive with insurance (which is illegal in our state)
* Drives as fast as her car can  go everywhere she goes (made fun of me for doing the speed limit, even though I told her I was in a head on collision earlier this year)
* I get a strong feeling of she wants me to be someone that’s buys everything for her
* She “jokingly” asked for the AirPods Max twice

I know that may not mean a lot to a lot of people, or anyone else. But how people take care of their car is how I can get a reading on people and how they are as humans, and I hate to say she was on the far bad side of things to me. 

I first decided to offer Main Event for our first date, I enjoy going there and will have fun regardless of the date. But after talking with her, I offered to meet up for a late dinner a day prior to the Main Event date to just see if we’re compatible. 

I don’t mind driving, my car gets really good gas mileage. I told her to look for a IHOP somewhere between us, but she went on to say their wasn’t any between us, and the only one was right next to her house. I passed 3 on the way to the one she wanted to meet at. 

Apparently she went to drink with her coworkers before our late dinner, and she said she only had one drink. It looks like she was drunk, like 5 or 6 drinks ( I don’t drink so I don’t have a good measurement) if not way more. I was kinda worried and told her I don’t mind waiting as long as she needs to sober up, but she kept on saying she wasn’t drunk and only had one drink. 

Again I don’t mind driving, so I asked which Main Event she wants to meet at, and she chose the one next to her house, instead of the one right in between us.  Fast forward to yesterday night, we were supposed to meet at 9 for the date. She kept on pushing it back until 10. I get there and she doesn’t arrive till 10:30. She sat in her car for almost thirty minutes eating chips telling me she needs to pee instead of going inside immediately to take care of business. 

She runs inside without talking to me and runs to the bathroom, and is in there for another 30 minutes. She’s on her period so I understand that she has lady stuff she needs to take care of. 

After thirty minutes I got up and left, I didn’t tell her anything and didn’t message her while she was in the restroom. 

I blocked her number and got two private caller numbers on the way home. 

I feel so guilty, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so bad in my life. But it just felt like she didn’t care. 

I like everything organized and planned out, the opposite of what she did. 

Sorry if this post is messy, I’m just feeling “frazzled” just thinking about everything.

Edit: after this date, I don’t know if I’m really ready to start dating again.

Edit 2: she said she woke up to being on her period, is that normal to not keep track of it? Or did I just overthink it?

Edit 3: A: I truly had a severe lack of understanding of the female menstrual cycle. I read through all the messages and I feel bad for making assumptions. I didn’t realize the amount of factors when it came to it. I truly thought it was something that could easily be kept track of. 

B: I might be needing a new number in the near future. I’ve gotten some less than stellar text messages from either her friends/family/ or coworkers, not too sure who as I don’t want to ask.",dating

He has that ""golden retriever energy"" that people talk about, very extroverted, has done so much with his life and has an endless number of stories, and he just really enjoys being nice and social with people.

The problem with this, is when we go out he constantly has attention from women. We go out at least 1-2x a week, and 3 times in the last 2 months a female server we have had has given him her number on the receipt. WE ARE ON A DATE, and 3 separate times a waitress has written her number on the receipt. He thinks its funny and shows me, and the first time I laughed it off, just thinking of the audacity of that girl who did it. Then the second time it annoyed me a little bit, but the 3rd time was the other day and now I am getting annoyed. This isn't just going out to eat, it has happened when we have gone to the beach too, and the gym he goes to (although we don't go to the gym together).  


So I really need advice on how to talk to him about this. I don't want to try and change his fun/flirty personality because I really love it, and he has never made physical contact with these women (that I have seen), but it makes me feel bad... Am I just making a big deal about nothing? My friends tell me I should take it as a compliment that he gets all this attention and laughs it off and doesn't act on it, but I don't know.

For example, I want a wife and kids. And she doesn't want kids at all. So already thats one major difference. Second, I'm a Catholic. She's a pagan. And she's not a fan of Catholicism, so again, not a major match point there.

We're mostly friends through our hobbies, but when it comes to lifestyle we're completely different. Especially because I'm an avid outdoorsman, and she's more of an indoors girl.

I just don't understand WHY she wants to date me when we're just that different?

EDIT FOR EXTRA CONTEXT: She's cool, but its not fair to either of us if the other had to rapidly change their lifestyle to suit the other, so thats why I won't do it. 

Also yes she calls herself a pagan. But doesn't specify on it",dating
1952,Didn’t offer to pay,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been seeing this girl and we’ve gone on three dates. She suggested wine tasting for the first one since she had a monthly membership but then we also got something to eat where I paid. We went on a dinner date for the second one and I paid completely. I didn’t had any issues. For the third one she suggested we should do some kind of an activity. So I booked an escape room. After the game we went to get a drink and something light to eat. I was hoping she would pick up the bill and pay. But no sign after few minutes at all so I ended up paying there as well. I was kinda surprised she didn’t offer to pay at all. Till then there was nothing I didn’t like about her but that made me little uncomfortable if me paying each time is the expectation she has. 

Is this a red flag? I’d like to bring it up to her but also don’t want to ruin this? 
Other thing I can do is to make her plan the next date and don’t pick up the bill at all on the next date. I definitely would like to set forth right expectation cause I don’t mint money lol.

Thank you

TLDR; She has only paid for wine tasting and I’ve paid for three meals and drinks and an escape room. She didn’t offer to pay or showed any efforts to pay the last time we saw and that’s what put me off.",dating

Initially, dating seems to go well with good conversation. However, I cant help but notice that whenever someone comes to my house and asks about the pictures or about my past and I bring it up, its ends not long after.

1957,Being ghosted sucks. Being flaked on sucks.

They'll be wishy washy about meeting up, while making it SEEM plausible that they do want to see you. But you'll never get an emphatic ""YES"" or ""NO"" from them.

At this point, if there was a pill. A drug of some sort, to destroy this disease that is the ""desire"" to associate with the opposite sex for the purpose of procreation or a desire for companionship, I would take it in a heartbeat to destroy that side of my humanity.

It goes like that for maybe a couple hours, then the feeling is over and the prospect of trying to look for a girlfriend, much less keeping and maintaining a
relationship seem far too bothersome and I dismiss the idea.

Dunno why I get these feelings, especially as there have been times in the past when I could have had a
girlfriend, had I simply reached out and made an effort with an interested girl, but on the few times that chance came I just couldn't be bothered. I felt apathetic about the prospect and that a relationship would be too bothersome to maintain.

1964,My (25F) boyfriend (25M) told me he wants someone who puts as much effort into their physical appearance as him - is there any coming back from this?,"My boyfriend of a few years recently told me my lifestyle is unattractive (because I don’t exercise enough) & wants someone who ‘matches the effort’ he puts into his physical appearance & I don’t ‘appreciate’ the effort he puts in on his body. He said he wouldn’t want to raise kids with someone who lives like me. I have since asked for space. He’s followed up to say he thinks I look beautiful/perfect and it’s about my lifestyle rather than how I look. Is there any coming back from this? I can’t help but feel I’ve been told I’m not good enough or attractive enough for him. I’ve been told I don’t meet his standards but he hasn’t broken up with me & I know would be really upset if I end this now, I feel almost like he’s keeping me around but will continue to make me feel like I’m not good enough. How do I stay in a relationship where I’ve been told it’s conditional on me changing when I think my lifestyle is fine. Do I leave him?

(For context, he is an athlete so trains in the gym 5-6 times a week & calorie counts everything. I would describe my body type as ‘normal’ I’m a UK size 10 & I’m relatively active but I definitely don’t eat as healthily as him but also l focus my energy on my career which isn’t physical like his).


Edit** overwhelmed by the number of comments. I think reflecting on everyone’s words have made me realise a few things. 

1) I probably should have included some context on the other things he’s said to me that have made me feel like I’m not good enough(unrelated to fitness). I feel like everything I do big or small is criticised. I think I would find it easier to compromise if I felt like I was also getting what I needed from the relationship.
2) I’m not opposed to improving my lifestyle. I think I’m resentful of being told our relationship is conditional on me changing to fit him, when I don’t expect him to live his life like I do (eg good career is really important to me but I don’t expect or pressure him to want the same salary etc). It’s not that I’m a lazy person, we just prioritise different things. 
3) I’m honestly just hurt by the tone/language used, maybe I didn’t convey that enough in my post because I wanted honest opinions on the content of what he said. I didn’t feel like he came to me in a supportive way. I brought up that I had these insecurities & confirmed them & got annoyed at me when I was upset.
4) I think everyone is right that he has the right to expect certain things from his partner, although I always want to be better, feeling required to change or that I’m not good enough is going to be a recipe for disaster. Given that I can’t promise to live exactly the lifestyle he wants, maybe it’s just time to confront the fact that our lifestyles are just incompatible.

1966,Don’t go after women or men that you know are not interested in you.,"      Don’t waste your time pursuing something you know I’d doomed from the start to fail. It’ll only waste your time. Also try not to focus on dating but perusing something your interested in and be genuinely invested in yourself, love should find itself when you least expect it. I say this as a general statement but it’s also something I tell myself (20m) cause I need to hear it. I’m high functioning on the autism spectrum but I don’t like to say I am because if I do suddenly that’s all I’m thought of as. Especially when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. But I’ve sort of learned the best thing to do is to just live life and dive into hobbies, I don’t know if or when I’ll ever get with anyone, but dwelling on it is no good.

1968,broke off things because of her drug use,"basically what title says. i’m a college student that’s been seeing this one girl for about two months and things have been progressively becoming pretty serious. however, i broke off things tonight. 

she had told me in the past that she’d dabbled with harder drugs like coke before, but i assumed she wasn’t really still. then today when she came over she made an off handed remark about how she had been on six substances today (coke, adderall, weed, alcohol, whippets, and i forgot what else).

now, i drink and smoke weed somewhat frequently so i didn’t care about that, but all of the other stuff really rubbed me the wrong way. i raised it as something i’m just not comfortable with, especially if we were going to become more serious. she essentially said in return, “it doesn’t really affect you, so why do you care? i’m not just going to magically be able to fix the way i cope with all of the things i’ve been through.”

i tried explaining that from my experience, when you’re in a relationship, damage you’re doing to yourself harms the other person too since they actually care. also, it doesn’t bode well if that’s how someone copes… (i didn’t say that ofc)

i feel awful. i really like her and she was super distraught that this was a dealbreaker for me. i hate that i’ve made her feel like a bad person unworthy of love. am i being too close minded? or am i justified in finding this to be grounds to end things? any other thoughts appreciated. no idea whether i’ve fucked up badly or stood true to myself.",dating

ETA: Thank you for all the constructive advice. It's clear I need to have an honest conversation with him about where my feelings are at and then leave the decision of whether to continue the relationship up to him.

I felt there  were a lot of common things between us (Love for movies, both nerds, common native place, marvel/B99 fans).  I resisted saying anything for two-three appointments, since it was her workplace) but after she said she was marvel fan, I thought I should it give it a go. I called her outside clinic for a couple of minutes, thanked for making me feel comfortable while treating me and asked her if she would like to hang out (not 'on a date'). 
She was a bit surprised but she said yes. I took her phone number and again asked if she was okay because she seemed nervous (As was I), she said yes. I texted her that evening thanked her again and said 'hope we can hang out soon' to which she replied 'we'll hang out soon 😄'.  I sent her some Marvel/B99 memes, she reacted with laugh emojis. I tried to be as polite as I can during all this. This was last week.

 Two days ago, I texted her 'if she wants to hang out this week/weekend'.  She said 'No...really packed week😅' I said 'cool 😄'

I went for another appointment today (a lot of cavities) and it was awkward kinda. She didn't about anything non-work related.

Just this week two different tinder matches (both are guys in their early 30s) told me that they are looking for a relationship that is “not a one night stand or a hookup, but nothing serious either”. I was like “ah okay, so like fwb?” and both of them said pretty much the same thing: “well, kinda like that, but I want it to be exclusive, so no sleeping around with other people, just with one partner, but casual, nothing serious cause I’m not ready for that”. 

Is this exactly what people call “situationship”? I’m just so confused. I’m used to tinder guys saying upfront that they just want fwb, hookups, one night stands or any other form of sexual relationship with no strings attached but somehow this new thing seems to be the most insulting and the least rewarding? Like, they want to get all the benefits of the relationship (including the stability and exclusivity when it comes to sex which also provides the safety that one can’t find in random hookups) without actually taking any responsibility whatsoever?

I told him and he was reluctant at first but ended up wanting to do it. Without being too graphic, I was on top and it was good at first but then I got my ahem, period, and it was kind of a lot. He said we should probably stop and I agreed and then apologized. He seemed nice about it and said there was no reason for me to apologize because it’s natural, etc. 

The next day, I felt a shift in his communication & thought maybe he was genuinely busy but from then on, ours texts went from all day to maybe 1-2 a day. I mentioned how embarrassed I was about what happened and he reassured but then dwindled off a few days later til he completely ghosted. 

Before this happened, we were with his friends and he was acting a little distant towards me around them so things did feel a little off then, so idk if something else happened before then.

Tl;dr: I’m just utterly humiliated about the whole situation and am embarrassed. I feel like he probably told his friends about it and they probably laughed about it.

Hi all,

I'm (F31) together with my partner(M35) for 2 years now. When we argue, I want to talk things out. He shuts down/ignores me (over text, we don't live together). He can ignore me for 2 days.

Today I found out that he ignored his mother for a full week!! She started to cook his favourite meal to get things okay again, but he refused to eat it. 

It's like his mother wants to do everything to get things right again. 

I was thinking today and I'm thinking of breaking up with him.  If we have a problem, I want to talk it out with him. He can't,  instead he ignores me. He does the same to his mom for a full week!!! I will be like his mom one day, getting ignored for a full week. Such a disrespect.

I’m conventionally attractive, though nothing special. I’m educated, fun, and I’m a nice person. I don’t have a car or a home or a savings account like some people. I’d love to get married and have kids but most people just seem to want hook ups so I kind of gave up on that.

I don’t know if it’s the guys I’m meeting, but dating has been pretty depressing and so have been my relationships. Guys can be pretty mean about me not having money. Or judgy if I do get a bit and want to buy myself something. I’m not an expensive date, I don’t expect partners to pay for me, but once they find out my about my financial situation I guess they assume that? 

My last relationship was super exhausting. He always judged what I spent my money on, and lorded over me that he made more. If I wanted bread that was a $1 more than the on sale brand, I’d have to hear it. I felt like I wasn’t allowed to have anything because I was/am “poor”. Can’t do anything fun that costs money. Can’t go on vacation. Can’t buy anything etc. Then it got thrown in my face all the time that I was broke and sure, we could get married, but my “financial situation was going to need to be resolved” first. But it’s super hard to escape the cycle of poverty, and the kind of work I do is low paying. 

I want to date and get a boyfriend… somebody. But every dude seems to care about credit scores, debts, what job you have etc. 

Should I just move to hook ups? They normally don’t care right? I would love to date and meet someone but it’s hard to date when you are poor I guess.",dating

1997,I’m tired of being treated as disposable,"I (23M) got stood up last night. Again. I sat around at the place we were supposed to meet at for 40 minutes looking like an idiot. It made me feel sick. I was really looking forward to meeting this person.

I’ve been single for a year now. Back in December I made a promise that I would try to really put myself out there and go on as many dates as possible. But so far it’s been nothing but stressful, painful, and disheartening.

I’ve matched with over 50 women since January. Out of those 50, I’ve been able to get 12 to agree to a date. But out of those 12, 8 have canceled last minute, 2 have stood me up, and 2 barely put any effort to the date I arranged and paid for.

My IRL attempts haven’t been any better. It feels like women make themselves so unapproachable that if I do go up to them I’ll be branded as a creep. I’m not a creep and I don’t want to be labeled as such.

Is this just modern dating as an adult? Why do people think it’s acceptable to use someone for a weeks worth of attention (everyone likes getting a phone notification!), but when it actually comes to meeting it’s like you never existed.

Can anyone provide insight on this? Because I can’t seem to figure it out for myself.",dating
1998,My penis size is putting me in a bad head space about future relationships (Thin girth),"My penis size is putting me in a bad headspace regarding future relationships. My dick size is around average length, just over 5 inches, but my girth is very thin at 4.2 inches.
Over the last year, knowing that I've got small girth has made me start watching cuckolding and sph porn. I fucking hate it because I know I don't enjoy it and it's something I never want to do, but it seems like that's the only way I can have a future relationship is by a open relationship or cuckolding, especially the way society is going with glorifying cheating,body shaming men (penis size) and hook up culture (nothing wrong with hooking up).

1999,Is excessive sex normal in the beginning stage?,"Hi everyone. I’m 23f and talking to 29m. It’s been about a month or so of seeing each other. Our dates went pretty well (made our in the first one), we actually have good convos and can talk for hours. Ever since we first had sex, that’s the only thing that we’ve been doing. It’s been about two weeks since we started and that’s all we do. I’m not complaining, because my last relationship was very awkward and I think we were sexually incompatible (I have a high drive and he had a low drive). The current guy I’m talking to brought up going on a trip together and going to a concert, but that can’t be done right now. He invited me to a bbq at the last minute but I wasn’t able to come. So I don’t think he’s purposely doing this - vice versa.

Would it be offensive to tell him that I want a balance? I don’t want him to think that I don’t enjoy sex. I love sleeping over at his and what not, but I want to see him in other settings like before. And for those in LTR, did you go through a phase like this ?",dating
2000,Do you ladies ghost for this?,"I have my own thoughts on the matter but I want to know what everyone else does. When you’re texting a guy you met in person or off a dating app about random things, and then he makes a sexual comment, do you:

•block and ghost
•correct him and block after 
•correct him and move past it, while raising a red flag 

Example:
You - “I love meditating on the beach. It makes me feel really at peace”
Him - “I mean as long as I get to rub the sunscreen on your beautiful ass I’m down to go meditate haha”

I have friends who manage to find a new crush on a monthly basis but for me it takes a hell of a lot for me to want somebody. It’s a blessing and a curse because it means unlike my friends I can’t get my feelings hurt every other month but it also means when I do want somebody it’s intense and crippling and I can’t really handle the rejection.

However, some girls are really into Korean music and drama, but then they would want Korean instead of other Asian guys, even we all know Kdrama just glorified the Korean guys and those are very unrealistic..

Thanks for all the comments and advices, and I would like to add one more thing is, it's not like we don't put any efforts, and I am sure most Asian guys put more efforts than most Caucasian guys, especially we know we have the disadvantage, but the thing is how can we put effort if we don't even have a chance or equal opportunity?

2005,I’d convinced myself I was unattractive and not worth dating; now a cute girl wants to go on a date with me and I’m terrified,"
I’ve always been an ugly duckling and growing up I had no romantic experience, I really got myself down about it and it really messed up my self esteem but over time I started caring less and less and just numbed myself to it. I still have really bad self esteem but I don’t torture myself over it all, I just had the attitude of it is what it is. I’d missed too many milestones, I was too far behind, I wasn’t attractive and I was too boring, so how could I ever date anyone?

Lately though things have kind of changed. When I go out women flirt with me. I get quite a few matches on dating apps and a few times it’s almost ended up in a date. But there’s like some part of me that still fundamentally believes nobody could ever want to date me even though it’s an irrational thought. I’d totally convinced myself nobody could possibly be attracted to me, and I end up getting in my own way when it comes to dating. I’ll not respond back with flirting, I’ll ghost people who seem interested on dating apps and find some minor fault that means we won’t be compatible, etc.

Last night I matched with a girl on tinder who I’d have said was out of my league. We totally just hit it off. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s cute, I got her number and we were texting for hours and she said she was really attracted to me and loved talking to me and that she’s down for going out and grabbing drinks.

And I’m terrified. Because now this is making me have to confront all my fears and anxieties. Cause there’s the truth; people can want to date me, people can be attracted to me, and I can’t run away from it all forever out of fear. I can’t rationalise my way out of the fact we have chemistry, I can’t find a single reason not to go on a date apart from my own insecurity, and if I don’t take her out I’m basically just admitting that it’s nobody else that’s the problem, it’s me.

I can’t keep letting my anxiety and fear dictate my life. I’m just so terrified to go on a date, I’ve never been on a real date in my life, I’ve never had sex, etc., and what happens when she realises how inexperienced I am, or how ridiculously nervous I am, or a million other things that could go wrong happen? My instinct is just to stop replying to her and forget it happened, but I realise how unhealthy it is. I can’t keep living like that forever, I need to face all my fears at some point, but it just feels so overwhelming.",dating
2006,Is it okay for men to go to a strip club while in a relationship?,"I read this post where the girl told her partner to not go to strip club at his friend’s bachelor party and he said okay and when he went out, he stopped texting her throughout the night and then when she looked at his location, he was apparently at a strip club and she broke up with him. 

Some people said she was being a “hawk” by looking at his location and she is overreacting and to let him have his fun. While some other people including me said that it was a boundary she set, he didn’t listen and her feelings are valid because to her, it was a big deal. 

I am confused about the comments that blamed the girl for overreacting over him going to the strip club. I personally wouldn’t want my partner go to a strip club no matter what the context because Im not comfortable with that. I would also break up with my partner if they said okay to my boundary and went to a strip club.

To add some context:
Not all of them were first dates, she dated one for over a month and then was ghosted but also rejected some others.
She was dating multiple guys at the same time, even did make out with two on them on the same weekend.
She mentioned that she was thinking about been polyamory (first you need to be whith someone for that I guess) and that she was in the past but didn't work.

2008,My boyfriend broke up with me because I wanted to watch avatar the last airbender with him,"I had been seeing this guy for 7 months, over these seven months I had helped him when he was sick and while he sick he said if I hadn’t been there that he would have unalived himself, I had helped him when he had relapsed (he had been an alcoholic) and helped him when he was having a mental breakdown from switching medications. I had also been writing a book to try to make money for us to go on a vacation together. I had also frequently bought him food and groceries and he owes me $140 for all of that. 

He has never been good with communication and it’s like pulling teeth to get ahold of him. But he had also been there for me when I was struggling for the most part. He has looked up things to do to help somebody with an anxiety attack and had helped calm me down before. But he’d also cancel plans quite a bit though, but I didn’t think it was purposeful.  

I thought we had loved each other. He had told me he loved me, I had believed him.  

Recently his grandfather has refused to eat and his family and him were frantically trying to go see his grandfather who is on his deathbed, we had had plans that day (Friday) to see each other for the first time in two weeks and I had been sad when those plans were cancelled but he was going through much worse than canceled plans so I was worried about him and his family and started trying to call to ask if he was okay after a couple of hours and just see how he was doing. He didn’t pick up for hours. 

I have anxiety and with the issues of his I’ve seen in the past I was worried and started having a panic attack, I eventually got ahold of him and had said that before you leave for Michigan can we see each other so I can see you’re okay, he didn’t know when he’d be going but said he’d try.  

After that night I asked about seeing him the next day (Saturday) and we have dinner or if he could stop by my house after dropping family members at the airport as I live on the way, he said no and had promised me we’d see each other the next day. I don’t hear from him Saturday night and had wanted to discuss the plans for Sunday. 

We had said that we would watch avatar the last air bender and I’d pick up food for us after work. I had wanted to confirm I was picking up food and what I should get. Sunday morning comes and I still hadn’t heard from him and began calling to get ahold of him to find out before I went to work. 

He texted me saying that his grandfather had died and that he didn’t get to say goodbye and that I can do what he had told everyone else to and fuck off. I said that I was sorry, that I wanted to hear from him and make sure he was okay but he said he was dropping everything and getting on a plane to Michigan and wouldn’t talk to me for three and a half hours but he said he’d tell me when he lands. 

The entire night goes by without me having heard from him at all and becoming more and more worried and calling more and more trying to get ahold of him. I started having nightmares that he lied about going to Michigan and had killed himself. 

I got very little sleep and when I woke up I texted his mom to see if he had made it to Michigan and to offer my condolences, she said that his grandfather hadn’t died yet and that he hadn’t flown out of town. My heart sank and I feared the worse. 

I call him again and he finally picks up. I was crying and heartbroken he’d lied to me and broken his promise. I told him I texted his mom and asked why he did this. He had said he’d lied because he didn’t want to hangout with me. That I was too much for him. He broke up with me. All I had tried to do was help him, I just wanted to give him some time where he could relax and I could make sure he was okay.  

I’m still in shock that this happened. I thought he and I would be together right now. I thought he was my one. I just want to be happy, I just wanted to love him and be loved by him. I had tried so hard and it hurts so much.

Please be kind if you reply, I’m trying my best right now but it hurts that I won’t be able to talk to my best friend anymore, it hurts that I we won’t talk about our days with each other anymore, that we won’t make each other laugh anymore.",dating

2010,The dating proces has made me stop believing in love...,"I don't think I believe in love. And at most I believe it exists for others, but not for me. It's not that I don't want to believe in love, it's just that all previous experiences for me have been very disappointing. 

Every time I allow myself to start believing it might be possible when it is going well with a guy, it turns to shit. I know dating is about finding the right person at the right time and so many things have to align for it to work. But at the same time, it seems to align pretty easily for others. 

I do tend to be a true romantic at heart which doesn't really help with the disappointment as it hits even harder. I really want to find love. But maybe it doesn't exist and I am just setting myself up for failure? When I say I don't believe in love, I also know it's a lot of fear talking. I don't know when I became such a cynic, but I am. I feel like such a bitter person sometimes and I wish I wasn't, but it's like I can't help it. 

Nobody has ever loved me or given me a chance. And to make matters worse. There was never a reason. I even got, I really like you and I felt something, but then it all went to shit and they started ignoring me. So yeah.... trust shattered. I guess I wonder how other people keep believing in it? Maybe because you felt loved before so you know it exists? I have never felt that. Nobody has ever told me they loved me and maybe nobody will ever say that to me.

I can hold a conversation, I have hobbies, I have an interesting back story, I am a good listener, I am caring and empathetic.

However, I never got dating. I never understood how to approach someone. I never had a hookup or a FWB. Whenever I had a romantic interest in a woman it was always rejection after rejection. I never understood how to ""create sexual tension"" as a lot of people say here. I had a few relationships in my life but in all of them the women approached me first, not me. Online dating was a failure. Very few matches, stale conversations and even fewer dates that led to nothing, so I deleted all the apps.

I feel like 18-25 are the most transformative years of your life. People are making life-altering decisions and trying to figure out what they want to do in life, where they belong, and what works best for them. 

However, it is the norm, at least in America, to look for a partner during these years. I understand meeting someone unexpectedly and wanting to keep them in your life, but I don't understand why people go looking for relationships. Don't you want to explore your own opportunities first? How are you supposed to know where you fit in the world if you only experience life with an SO?

Personally, I know what I want and I don't want to intentionally navigate that with or compromise it for someone else. If I happen to meet someone along the way, great! But why would I make these years more complicated than they need to be by seeking out someone who is navigating their own life-altering decisions?

Tldr: young adulthood is a time to figure out your OWN life and I don't understand why we're expected to do that with someone else

2016,What piece of advice would you give the younger you about dating?,"Pretty much the title. If you could give the younger you advice on dating what would you say?

For me, the three pieces of advice that I'd tell the younger me is:

1. Don't put too much into the talking phase 
2. Don't let yourself get in the way of talking to someone new
3. Don't overthink everything

In the past, I'd put way too much into the talking phase and would be really disappointed when things didn't work out. I think in my mind I figured that if someone is giving me their number and then continues to talk to me, then they must like me and be interested in going on a date. Obviously, this is not the case. The other thing as well is I used to get in the way of myself from talking to girls that I thought were cute. In college, I used to overthink things and think that if I approached someone they'd think I'm being creepy. After a while, I came to the realization that I was really getting in the way of myself meeting new people because I was overthinking everything in my mind. My new motto is just shut off your brain and don't think. What I mean by this, is just treat the conversation as if you're talking to any other person. Don't treat it differently because it's someone that you want to ask out or get their number or whatever the case may be.",dating
2017,The weirdest deal breaker ever?,"So this story begins like any other: 

I (33M) matched with a cute women (39F) on Coffee Meets Bagel.  We had a brief conversation on there before moving to Discord.  We had a lot in common - nerdy, into similar games etc.  During our back and forth she ended up sending me her Bumble profile on Discord, which had a more robust bio to show me.  I than reciprocated, took screenshots of my Bumble profile and sent her mine.  And this is where everything went downhill.

She sent me a message ""Oh you're into horror 😬"" which I thought was no big deal - I told her after sci-fi/fantasy horror is my next favorite genre.  We then talked about not seeing eachother on Bumble, which we accounted for my age search preferences.  I told her that being 39 wasn't a deal breaker for me, which she replied ""As far as dating goes, my only real deal breakers are liking horror or playing blizzactivision games"".

Now previously we had a discussion about Blizzard/Activision and that I don't play their games anymore, although ironically she was sending me OW play of the game clips.  Not sure why exactly this was also a deal breaker, but we at least moved on from it.

But here's the kicker: liking horror was an actual deal breaker.  Surely she was jesting, so I'd asked her if I'm already out for the count.  She quickly replied with ""Mhm"".

After some comments/questioning on my end, she mentioned she had her reasons why but didn't want to explain.  Since I'm no longer a potential suitor, she quickly followed up with the classic ""well if you're not open to being friends just say so lol"".

For a brief moment, I wanted to tell her that not liking horror was the most outlandish and ridiculous deal breaker I have ever heard.  But I decided to take the moral high ground, and close it up saying that if liking horror overshadows the rest of the person I am than so be it.  I was blocked shortly after.

My question is this: am I crazy, or was this women completely off her rocker?  When I think of deal breakers here's what comes to mind: excessive drugs/smoking/alcohol use, no job, unhygienic, kids/not wanting kids etc.  Who knew reading Stephen King would be such a red flag.

Well, what keeps happening is that I’ll be into a girl and I’ll be talking to her and flirting and kind of be in the early stages of talking and my friend will always swoop in and take her attention away. It happened recently and I’m kind of wondering if I’m doing something wrong.

Both of my last two girlfriends admitted they had huge crushes on my friend all their lives. The first girl was never that into me so when she brought it up unprompted and clearly yearned for him it hurt even more because she never yearned for me. 

The second girl admitted it in front of all my friends and it was super emasculating. The first time this happened I was chill with it but the next time I realized there was a pattern.

I found out that with another woman (3rd) I was trying to date she had already dated my friend. LONG AGO another fourth girl who I had asked out and we’d gone out left me for him.

He’s so irresistible that it’s straining my friendship with him and I’m starting to resent him.

I keep feeling like I’m getting sloppy seconds or almost run over by him. While I’ve tried to become better at being charismatic I think I simply don’t have the right personality. Don’t get me wrong I’m plenty dateable but I’m starting to feel like a third or fourth option instead of a priority.

2028,This Girl Just Shattered My Confidence To Date. How Do I Get It Back?,"So, I’m a 23 year old male who met a 23 year old female. We went on a date last week. Everything was good, she came to my house and ended up spending the night. Everything you can expect to happen happened. 

Fast forward and she disappeared for like two days without anything. I told her hey, since we were discussing something serious I’d need someone who’s a little interested. She said that was fine and work had been getting hectic. I said that was fine I understand, what’s going on at work. We talked flirtatiously on and off for a week.

Fast forward to today. This girl pretended to be at my gate. She text me and asked me what the gate code was. I text back only to discover the sad truth that I’m blocked. Now I’m just sitting here wondering what I did so wrong that she led me on to this point—

We had lots of chemistry and after we kissed he told me it was unusual for kissing the be that good right away with someone new. On the third date he stayed over and we had sex twice at night and in the morning. The sex was great with lots of eye contact etc. In the morning he said he slept well because he felt very comfy able and relaxed and that he’d had a dream we were at a party together and he was meeting my friends. Then later in the day texted to say he was happy for a fourth date but only saw it being a casual thing? I feel completely blindsided and questioned him on it and he said it was due to lack of chemistry which I thought we had in buckets.

I feel freer, happier, more attractive, funnier, more productive, etc. Basically I feel more like myself. As soon as I cross the 6-9 month threshold in a relationship, I begin to feel the opposite of all of those things. I hang out with friends less (especially at my age now when they all have kids), and just generally do fewer things outside of the relationship. I don't become clingy or anything, but I find that once my partners start to get accustomed to me and my habits, they start finding me less funny, less attractive, all the usual stuff where you feel taken for granted.

I know the usual advice people give is find a purpose and focus on it and that's more attractive etc..I already do that and it's my number 1 focus.

I feel this way in relation to every relationship I've been in since I was in high school. Not sure if I just always pick the wrong partners for me, or if this is how I'll always be no matter what. I know the common denominator is myself.

2042,When do you start seeing other people,"*STOP not START 

I had a great first date. Texted him first and told him I had a great time and that ""next's one on me"".

Second date yesterday. Took him to lunch, had a more thorough personal conversation, he offered to pay half but I told him no lol (said maybe next time or we can take turns lol). Went back home, got funky, had a lot of fun and he had to go back home that same night because he's got return ticket home.

At the lunch date, I did tell him I don't like two-timing people and I much prefer to keep talking to on person at a time. He said it depends on the person so it's understandable. But the night was a great and he couldn't perform (but he did drove me over the edge and I got there in the end - even managed to do a porny-thing I never thought I could do!). He looked so happy he managed to do it lol

So now we're getting to the 3rd date.

I was thinking I'd tell him I want to stop talking to other people and see if he thinks we could do that together. I just really like him and he said the same thing, and he texted me today to say he'd love to see me again. But at the same time, I don't want to rush him.

Is the 3rd date okay or should I wait a little longer? And what about the other matches? Do I meet them still? (Tbh I don't feel like it because I really, really like this guy)

Because they all turned out horrible, I don’t know what that says about me. First, I am placed on this pedestal: I’m so cute, so smart, so pretty, so interesting, so kind. Then when I start “warming up”, the subtle criticism starts. Why do you wear your hair like that? Why do you laugh at everything, you’re so childish. Don’t ask me about other women you’re insecure. You’re too nice. You don’t listen. It’s like damn this is like my childhood all over again. It’s either that or I start feeling only wanted for my body (sexualized like i am a piece of meat)And then eventually I start hating them and have to cut them off.

I can go out with friends and have fun meeting new women and may kiss a few here and there and on the rare occasion we may hook up. But nothing really ever comes from these, I feel like I almost do it because I lack that physical intimacy in my day to day life. 

I’m also the type of person that once interested in someone will focus all my attention onto them and no one else. However, I’ve noticed a recurring theme that those who I end up really interested in don’t share the same interest level in me, then there have been people who are really interested in me and I just don’t ‘feel’ it. 
I’ve even given it ago because I thought maybe my feelings could grow for them? But I just couldn’t, it felt like I was having to fake interest and that it was not fair on the girl so I let her know that I only saw her as a friend and that she should find someone who feels the same about her. But still she insists that she wants me.. I’ve had to just ignore her in the end. 

It’s annoying and I feel bad because the same thing will happen to me in the people I like.

2048,Advice for Dealing with Anxious Attachment Style When Dating,"I suffer from Anxious Attachment Style.  It very nearly can destroy your relationship if your not careful.

Some things that I have to remember

Your anxious feelings will be at their highest in the first 2 months after meeting someone.  So you need to be extra careful in this time period.  Your going to obsess about whether or not they really like you, will you stop hearing from them one day, etc.  The first 2 months is the danger zone.  Be careful.  After 2 months you'll likely have an idea if things are going well with the person, and you will feel a little more secure, but you got to get through the first 2 months first without sabotaging the relationship.

Don't love bomb.  I'm guilty of this.  In your mind you think you're trying to show them how much you like them.  But in reality you are dumping all your insecurities on them.  Your love bombing them with an over the top amount of affection because that's what you want from them in order to get rid of your anxious insecurities.  Recognize your tendency to do this, and don't do it.  They will feel uncomfortable when you do this.  Instead, be more subtle in your displays of affection to them, especially early on.

Texting as an anxious type...it's going to drive you crazy when they take a long time to message you back, or don't message you as much as you hope they would.  Resist the urge to text bomb them.  If they take 6 hours to respond, just wait.  Wait.  It will be agonizing.  It will hurt.  You will feel like a drug addict that's been ripped away from his steady drip.  But remember this.  If you text them back with a 'where are you' or 'what's going on' or God forbid an angry or hateful type text, you will only make things worse.  You must realize that.  Being anxious only hurts your prospect with this person.  It does not help at all.

If they haven't texted you back for a long time, then they just don't feel like talking to you.  Accept it.  You must be vulnerable.  You must accept that the person you like does not want to talk to you right now.  You have to come to terms with them not being available or wanting to communicate with you 24/7.   But this DOES NOT mean they do not like you, or want to break up with you, or anything like that.  They just don't want to talk to you right now.  That's it.

Now, if they are always taking forever to get back to you, then yes, they probably do not like you.  But if they take a long time to respond to only 1/4 or 1/5 messages you send them and even take the time to explain why they took so long to get back to you, then they're probably someone who likes ou.

Avoid stalking their social media.  Do this, and your just adding fuel to the fire of your anxious attachment style.

Finally, remember that your far more likely to repel someone by being too attached and clingy, then if you were too distant and unavailable.  Anxious attachment minds think the key to winning someone over is going all in - but we think this because it's how we would like to be treated - and we like to be treated like this because we are unwell.  Remember that.  If you think you aren't doing enough, remember that it is better to be on the side of caution and do too little.",dating

2057,She Showed Up Drunk,"Hello everyone, just want to rant a little about my last date.

I met this girl on Tinder (I'm 30M, she's 27). We hit it off pretty well: we had the same sense of humor, both of us are career-focused, etc. We went on a first date at a bar about a week ago, and it went well, though there were a couple of warning signs (she was going through a divorce, had a troubled past, talked about her mom being abusive, etc.). None of this was too major, so I figured I'd give her a second chance.

We decided to meet for a second date at a local park. We were to meet at 6, but I left a little early to see the park for myself and explore a little. Around 5:45, I texted her to see if she was on her way, and didn't get an answer. As 6 approached, she called me saying she was sorry but that there was an accident and she was on her way. She said she'd been having a ""really bad day."" I said it was fine, I wasn't in any hurry and I understand that these kind of things happened.

She arrived about half an hour later. I could tell things were a little off, but I didn't think anything was too wrong at first. I thought she might've been flustered because she was late. She told me she had bad vertigo and that she'd been crying most of the morning because of another guy she'd rejected on a dating app. She said one of her friends had broken up with her boyfriend, so she'd gone to comfort/hang out with her and they had a little to drink. 

I still didn't see much of an issue, as I thought she just had a margarita with a friend or something. However, I was put off by her behavior and had decided I didn't want to keep dating her, so I was trying to find a way to end the date amicably. My intentions were thwarted when she tried to kiss me and I pulled away; she asked why I did that and I told her that I thought we'd be better as friends. She was mad and told me she didn't show up today to be friends. I told her I'm sorry about that, but that I didn't want to waste her time.

The dynamic changed almost instantly. She got friendly again, and kept talking about how great it was going to be now that we were friends, which I appreciated. She asked if I'd like to get a drink with her and I agreed, so we began to walk to a nearby bar. During this walk, she started touching me and getting close again, while I tried to move a little further away. She started making plans and telling me what we could do, and I sheepishly said I'd have to find out what my schedule looks like.

We got to the bar and she ordered a double shot of whisky while I ordered a mix drink. She downed the drink very quickly. She started to forget things she told me seconds ago and wouldn't let me finish my thoughts; she also started to tell me that she could get us a discount at a local hotel she worked at if we wanted to spend the night. I told her I needed to go home and she took that as an invitation to come back to my place. I told her that wasn't going to happen, but she acted like she didn't hear me. At this point, I was pretty done with her and just wanted to finish my drink and leave.

After a few minutes, she took my hand and started leading me out of the bar. She hadn't had any more drinks and my drink was basically half full (we had already closed out our tabs). She went towards her car and I went towards mine, just happy to be away from her. It dawned on me when I got in my car that she was drunk--VERY drunk--and that she probably shouldn't be driving. She tried to call me but hung up immediately; she rejected the call when I tried to call her back. I texted her when I got home and she told me she made it home safe, after which I deleted her number.

I dodged a bullet, but it bothers me that I missed such obvious warning signs early on in the date. We were only together for about an hour or so, but I totally believed that she was just upset and had vertigo until it was over. In retrospect, I think she lied to me about 90% of the things we talked about over text/on our first date; I won't go into specific examples, but there were some pretty outlandish claims that seem impossible in retrospect.

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest. If you're going to go on a date with someone, PLEASE have the common courtesy to show up sober.",dating
2058,"Ladies, would you agree to a prenup?","This is mainly for the ladies although men if you’d like to reply that’s fine.

Hypothetical. You’re dating a man for what you personally perceive to be an appropriate duration of time to determine you’d like to be married to him. When discussing the topic he says he will only get married if you sign a prenup.

How do you respond? Break it off or agree to the terms?

Additional context: 
1. Your partner was previously married and is now divorced, and although no child support or alimony is currently in effect he is still reeling financially from the damage caused by his ex wife. This is the main reason he insists on the prenup.

2. Of all the time you’ve been with him he has given no indication whatsoever of being financially irresponsible and has always been up front about his finances.

2061,Girl made me promise that we won't ghost each other. She then proceeded to ghost me,"*Disclaimer:  Went on a first date with a girl. She has definitely mental health issues and is very depressed (su\*c\*dal in fact)*

That being said; the entirety of the date she kept asking me if I wanted to see her again, she kept asking if I would ghost her but I said I won't. She mentioned this 4-5 times and I even said I promise I won't ghost her.We kept making plans about what we can do together and she was trying to say stuff like 'you can come to my place; I can cook you food; we can go to park'. etc.

She was afraid I would ghost her when she opened up about  her su\*c\*de attempts (she said she is over this, and going to therapy) but I said I am kind of fucked up too, I understand her and I don't judge her for it. I said that even I have some abuse/trauma issues and it feels like I won't be alone in this stuff.

All this happened very early in the date; and after this the date still went amazingly.She even bought me drinks. She literally said multiple times that she was having a great date, and texted her friend *in front of me* saying that she was having a great time. We kissed multiple times and she came back to my place. She said she didn't want to have sex and I didn't push ONE BIT.  I said let's take at your pace (cause she seemed to be in a tough place in her life). I said let's meet soon and she ecstatically said her entire weekend is free.It ended on a good note.

HERE's the Kicker.I usually tell girls to text me after they get home.

They almost always do but this girl didn't. Whatever. Then I gave it a day, and texted the day after (went out on Tuesday, I texted on Thursday evening). No reply till now. Guess she is ghosting me now. I unmatched and deleted her number; I won't even ask for an explanation.

**Where I stand:** I don't hate her one bit.. I know her life is in a fucked up phase, so its ok. Logically my mind knows whats up.",dating

Fast forward couple months after the breakup, I miss him terribly.  I’m now thinking he was just having conversations w other girls, I over reacted.  I’m reaching out to him and telling him I’m open to working things out and crickets.  We women feel like we deserve better but when we’re handed crumbs, we settle for it bc we’re scared we won’t find anyone else.  I have been on the dating scene for a little while and boy am I depressed.  I want my ex to want me back and to fight for me but he’s doing nothing.  I’m still hoping like a desperate girl that he’ll come back.  Why can’t I accept that he’s gone?  Why am I so willing to crawl to him for forgiveness when he’s the one that did me wrong?

2067,What are your thoughts on exclusively dating younger people?,"A friend (31M) intentionally put his age filter on a dating app at 21 to 33, because “33 yo or older women often have a child wish” and he is “just looking to date and to have fun and is not looking for a long term relationship or life partner”. He only went on dates with younger women.

I (33F without a child wish) thought this was a bit ageist and misogynistic (ETA: wrong wording, I meant biased) but maybe I’m overreacting. I’m not against age differences in dating per se, but I feel it’s different when you meet someone you like and matches your level of maturity but happens to be much younger versus actively seeking out younger women.

When I expressed him my opinion he told me I was judgmental and implicated I was a bad friend. And maybe I am? I’m curious to hear other people’s perspectives.",dating
2068,Dating in Late 20’s - so many people either want a wife or a hookup I feel like there’s no inbetween,"I’m 26F and I’m looking for someone to be in a relationship with and spend time with but I’m also not someone who is ready to get married soon, and I don’t know if I’m the “settle down” type. I really want to live in a few different places and eventually buy a house but I just don’t ever picture myself staying somewhere, maybe that will change as I get older. Also really unsure about wanting to have kids. I feel that 26 is still young enough to have a relationship where we are thinking about the future and dedicated to each other but don’t need to put pressure on things. So many people I come across are either desperately seeking a wife or just want a casual hook up. I feel like I’m somewhere in between. It kinda feels that what I’m looking for is impossible - I basically want a best friend who is laid back and won’t get mad if I want to try something new in life. I feel especially a lot of men try to make me into something I’m not and adhere to their life, not two individuals forming a connection together. I really like my independence and would like my partner to be independent too but also want a deep love with someone where we can experience life together. I really value emotionally intimacy and don’t want to just be in relationship to be in one. Kind of just a rant.",dating

In my past I have picked mostly abusive men. They would come on strong and eventually it led to that. However even chatting I have noticed men coming on strong and then being abusive with their language. Not being self aware is another issue and narcissistic.

2077,"Girls, have hookups ever been worth it for you?","As of this last month I had 2 encounters with 2 different guys. With the first dude we started to make out & despite it feeling a bit awkward I kept going. Then we start to take off our clothes & he tried to have sex with me & I immediately ask him if he has a condom & he says he does not. He tells me he’s not into condoms because he is unable to last long in them & doesn’t like the way they feel. He says he usually doesn’t use them but says he wished he I knew I wanted to use one otherwise he would have brought one...This was a first for me. Never had a guy try to have sex with me especially the first time without using a condom (other than in a long-term committed relationship). Before that he didn’t even ask if I was on birth control or anything. That pretty much concluded our night. He says he’ll bring one next time but idk if I want there to even be a next time since that says a lot about him if he never used them in the past. 

  
Second guy was better & it felt a little more natural as far as touching & kissing but he did not last long whatsoever. He brought condom but decided to take it off so he can let him self out on my lower belly. I wanted to be like wtf?! That’s what the condom is for! He didn’t even ask if that was okay. For one I was disappointed he lasted maybe only a few strokes & took off the condom during the time it was suppose to be on??! 

  
These were just the most recent experiences. I’ve had ones where the guys finish too fast, are selfish in bed, or have performance issues. I say all this to say I think I’m over hookups because they just don’t seem to be worth it. Despite how this may sound I’m not naturally promiscuous so they at times feel awkward for me & then there’s the STD risk on top of it despite a guy giving me clearance he’s STD free the last time he got checked… I also just feel gross the next morning & wash my bedding & obviously shower immediately after sex. 

  
Have any of you ladies found fwb or hookups worth it? I will say I have a some good hookups but majority of the times it’s just mediocre & not fulfilling for me. Perhaps this is a sign I need to just wait to find the right guy that I'd want to be in relationship in.",dating

2084,id I Make the Right Choice Prioritizing My Job?,"Hey Reddit,

I'm feeling a bit lost and could use some perspective. I'm a 25-year-old woman who recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend of two months. He ended things because he felt that I didn't put enough time and effort into our relationship and that I was too focused on my job.

To provide some context, I've always been ambitious and driven in my career. I work as a content creator in girlie magazines. I've worked hard to establish myself and have been dedicated to climbing the professional ladder. However, this seems to have affected my romantic relationships in the past.

I genuinely believed that I could balance my career aspirations and a budding romance, but now I'm questioning if I made the right choice by prioritizing my job. I always thought it was important to focus on personal growth and financial stability at this stage in my life, but now I'm questioning if I've neglected my love life.

So, Reddit, I'm turning to you for some advice. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Did you prioritize your career over a relationship, and if so, how did it turn out for you? Or, on the other hand, did you put your job on hold to focus on love, and how did that work out?

I'd love to hear your experiences and insights to help me gain some clarity in this confusing time.

TL;DR: My boyfriend broke up with me because he felt I prioritized my job over our relationship. Now I'm questioning if I made the right choice. Have any of you faced a similar situation, and how did it turn out for you?

Thanks in advance for your support and advice.",dating

2086,Female Friend Cheated on BF with another Male Friend,"So, I just found out that one of my closest friend had a sexual encounter with my other close friend who has a boyfriend.

To make this easier to understand, I will call my male friend
who cheated on GF (Hunter) and the female friend (Sarah). We are all 21+ by the way. 

One night last week, Hunter, Sarah, my other friend, and I went out drinking. We drove in two separate cars and Hunter drove with Sarah. As I was told later on in the week when I guess Sarah was feeling guilty for not telling me sooner, Sarah explained that after Hunter had one or two drinks out at the bar that he came onto her in the car. He kept touching her thigh and saying that he wanted to do “things” with her (you can interpret what you want from that). Sarah was not drunk at the time, but she did not stop him from being all over her in the car. She said that they had even kissed in the car briefly as well. 

As the night continued, we went out to the casino to drink some more and gamble. I was not aware of anything going on between the two of them, but there were several instances where Sarah and Hunter would go off on their own where myself and my other friend couldn’t see them. Sarah explained that Hunter was all over here then too (aka constantly initiating physical contact, grabbing her arm, and etc).

When we finally got back to the house to crash, I knocked out immediately on the couch because I was pretty drunk. Hunter went to his room and I guess invited Sarah up while I was passed out. Sarah told me that Hunter, again who was very drunk and I think a little high as well, kept telling her how much he wanted to fuck her and do things with her. Sarah, who was not as drunk because she maybe only had a couple sips of a drink, told him that he would regret doing anything with her in the morning and that they shouldn’t. Somehow through multiple persuasions on Hunter’s end, they were making out and one thing led to another and Sarah ended up giving him a blowjob. Afterward, he told her that it was the best BJ he ever had and he’s never experienced something like that before. He also wanted to have sex with her, but she told him no. Let me remind you all that Hunter has a girlfriend, someone he has dated for about three years now. 

Sarah told me all of this a couple days ago and doesn’t seem to regret what happened at all. She said that she shouldn’t be responsible for his relationship because he kept initiating it and she should be able to have what she wants. She also told me that he had been ignoring her since then and giving her a cold shoulder (undoubtedly “regretting” what they did as Sarah had told him before they did anything). She doesn’t seem remorseful at all. 

I am not exactly “friends” with Hunter’s girlfriend but I feel like an asshole for not saying anything to her regardless. It doesn’t look like Hunter is going to tell her what happened or what he did. What do I do? Do I keep what happened to myself even though I feel that if my partner cheated on me that I would want to know? Or do I tell Hunter’s GF what happened?

I feel like an asshole either way.

TLDR; male friend whom I live with (Hunter) cheated on GF with my female friend (Sarah). Both do not seem to want the cheatee (GF) to know what happened. 

Edit: I told him I knew what happened. He tried to play innocent at first then said he didn’t want to lose her.",dating
2087,Guy I slept with is being really difficult about me asking him to test for genital herpes,"So I’ve been talking to this guy for over a month (met on dating app) and we didn’t meet until about a week and a half ago. Prior to meeting I disclosed that I had just gotten out of a relationship and that I was only looking for a fwb. He agreed. I asked him when he last tested for stds and he said about 3 weeks prior. He shows me his std results and they were all good. In the back of my mind, I wanted to ask him to test for herpes too since I know herpes often requires a separate test from the standard std panel BUT i was dumb and didn’t ask for it bc i didn’t want to come off as super demanding and i trusted that he was responsible since he had just tested and everything came back clean. 

We hookup and he seemed nice but he kept disclosing he’s slept with a lot of people and that he’s had so many different types of relationships from the apps with both men and women. i became a little uneasy to hear of this bc the more people you sleep with the more risk you carry and he didn’t seem particularly concerned about me being clean prior to hooking up. he just took my word that i was clean, which i am but idk. i don’t think that speaks well of him if he’s actually sleeping with tons of people and not verifying they’re clean. 

anyway since we had sex, i’ve had pretty bad pelvic pain/cramps. it can’t be my period either bc i had just gotten off of my period prior to sleeping with him. he used a condom when we had sex but i went down on him unprotected and so did he to me. maybe i’m just overreacting but i’m worried i may have something? so i ask him if he’s tested for herpes and he says no. i ask him if he can and he says his insurance is inactive right now so he will once he gets it. this was all last week btw. i offer to pay for him to get tested at a clinic and he’s been refusing and reinstating that he’s clean and will get tested as soon as he gets his card. today i told him i’m pushing so much bc i have pelvic pain and he’s the only guy i’ve slept with and he’s ignored my texts all day. idk i’m getting a really bad feeling and i need some advice. does this guy maybe seem dismissive bc he knows he has something or he’s just too lazy to go get tested and i’m overthinking? seriously freaking out rn and i know i won’t test positive for herpes for at least 3 months so there’s no use in testing now.",dating
2088,Dating while being socially inept.,"Hello Reddit,

Another thing- he really likes cuddles, and likes cuddling me and going into my arms, but i really want to go in his arms.

He does this really REALLY hot thing, because i am short as hell and he is several inches taller than me. I hug his waist and he looks down at me and smirks and fuck its so hot. I want him to do that all the time.

We have established that during sex in the dominant one, but fuck i want him to be dominant.

2092,Addressing Popular Themes,"Alright, let me start off by saying that I am a 37f  and I was a counselor for 13 years. I figured this post might help some people that post here with very common themes. If you disagree with anything I say, that is more than alright. To each their own.

1: Ghosting. Ghosting happens to everyone, and it is done by BOTH genders for different reasons, most of them shallow. If it happens to you, yes, it sucks, even hurts, but its a THEM problem, don't waste your own time and energy trying to make it a YOU problem. Any changes you think you need to make to yourself should be for YOU, not for anybody else.

2: NO, it is NOT weird OR pathetic to have zero dating experience or be a virgin, even in your 20s or 30s or anything else, despite what society or pop culture has led you to believe. You live by YOUR timeliness, not anybody else's. There is no pressure to find ""the one"", get married, have kids, move away from home, none of it. We are living in a different time. Cost of living has become outrageous, not living alone is beneficial for alot of people to help prevent depression or anxiety episodes for those that struggle with mental health. There are so many people out there with your same issues, of BOTH genders. 

3. BOTH genders have some shallow people out there. There are women that judge men for their height, looks, bank account, dick size. There are men who judge women based on weight, general beauty, and other things. The important thing to remember if you are not one of these people and don't WANT to end up with one of these people, is that its not ALL of them. People that judge based on personality and goals still exist, they are just harder to find nowadays with lazy women that want to live off their looks, and shallow men that are just after hookups.

2096,finally quitting the apps,"I've been single for 4 years now. 97% of my dates were from OLD, so pretty much if I don't use it my dating life is non existent. Which sucks because although I hate using apps, I haven’t met anyone in real life for ages.

I've been having very shitty dating experiences this past year and a half. I used to feel sad about the person not corresponding the same feelings and wondering what was wrong with me, but now I'm just astonished by the audacity of some and don't take it personally anymore, which at least I feel happy about.

I feel so disposable and the minor incompatibility I get ghosted. From people asking me out to stop replying, feeling disrespected after sex, texting non stop with someone to then get ghosted after a small miscommunication, and so on.

It makes me genuinely frustrated to know there are people who don't have any issues to discard a human being like that. I don't know if it's just me, but dating post covid has gotten worse than it was before.

I really crave a connection with someone, but I'm tired of feeling like this. I really want to quit the apps for good, even if it takes getting into a dry spell for years.

2097,"Dateless and virgin at [27M], trying to improve but really struggling - is it over?","Hello everyone,  
I'm a 27 M guy that is going through a hard phase in his life. As title says, at my age I've never been on a date with a girl, and this is starting to really bother me. As weird as it sounds (giant red flag), there are some reasons: first of all, I'm extremely afraid of interacting romantically/sexually (aka flirting) with a girl. I'm mainly extemely afraid of being perceived as a ""creep"", so I don't push myself to say things that can be interpreted as flirting, to the point that I probably never ever complimented a girl in my life (except for friends, of course). Also, I'm terrified to receive a ""No"" as an answer, since I'm sure that would trigger a circle of very bad thoughts. Basically, girls rejecting me would just give credibility to that part of me that constantly shouts in my mind ""you're worthless, you're ugly, you're virgin at 27, you're no good"" 24/7, making me end up even more miserable than what I'm now that I don't even try.  
I've been in therapy for 1.5 years now, with three different therapists, but I didn't improve much in this aspect. This ""low self-esteem"" stuff was taught to me mostly by adults when I was younger, especially parents and teachers. Doesn't help also that I'm always comparing myself to the others and I always find a way to see myself inferior to everyone in at least one aspect of life.

Nonetheless, these negative thoughts didn't stop me to do things in my life. By 13yo, I was already hanging out with friends in my town all day. I've played football in a team, I've been to the gym (I still do), I've went to clubs and discos (not that much, but more than 10 times), I've been to birthday parties, I've made solid friendships that lasted since now, I've moved to a different city when I was 19yo to attend university. Somehow, I was able to do all these things despite my insecurities, although never flirting with a girl. I've met many of them in my life, but I was never able to explicitly flirt, regardless of the place or the moment. 

I've had some girls that showed clear interest in me, not many, but some. I remember at 16 I used to chat with a girl I knew on a trip to London with the school, she would message me on Facebook all the time with heart emojis, like all my post, always ask me how my day went and making compliments, to the point that when my friends read those chats they would as me if I was gay lol. But I never had the guts to ask her out or even to flirt, my messages were kinda dull and stuff and after several months she got bored and moved on. Similar story with a girl I knew at the gym at 19, I was new to the place and she would purposefully go to exercise near me even if I was in other rooms of the gym, until at a point we randomly started chatting and ending up exchanging names and IGs. Yet I've somehow succeeded in not make a move again, in a weird situation where you could kinda tell I was interested but I wasn't making any moves whatsoever despite her opennes. Eventually, she got bored aswell and moved on. I can list some more occasions, but the post is already long. This stuff stopped happening when I turned 24.

Slowly after hitting 21, and rapidly after 24, after graduating, my social life went to zero rapidly mainly because of two things: COVID and the beginning of hair loss (sigh). The latter completely shattered in pieces the low self-esteem I had, even though it wasn't apparent. Lockdown happened shortly after, and I found myself staying at home 24/7 except for one hour on Friday to do the grocery. I've spent two to three years of my life in my house, depressed, basically just working from home, gaming and sleeping. I was at the lowest point of my life, but eventually I decided to do something. I started working out and dieting daily: I had enough of being extremely skinny. I gained 10+ kgs in 2 years, and even though I'm kinda stuck lately and struggling to past the 68 kgs mark, I'm still in the best shape I've ever been, even though I still see myself as that skinny pale guy. I've learnt how to cook well, to the point that my friends that tasted my dishes said multiple times they had some of the very best meals of their life. I've started to travel exactly one year ago and I visited 3 countries and 10 cities in just a year, with old buddies but also alone to meet IRL some online friends. I've undergone a quite complicated medical operation to correct a skeletal issue and I faced it and the post-OP like a walk in the park. I've done many other things this year, yet I can't seem to improve my self-esteem. I still see myself as a balding-virgin-weirdo-skinny-inept guy that's trapped in his dead-end job just cause it pays above average (another issue in my life that triggers negative thoughts). I log in to Instagram and LinkedIn and see people full of themselves, males and females, living their best life while I'm struggling to keep up in the most basic things. And then, of course, girls: everytime I see an attractive one at gym, at a bar or elsewhere, I can't escape getting in the spiral of negative thoughts towards myself: ""who would want to date a 27 yo dateless virgin?"" and such. 

I would like to say that I'm not an Asperger type of guy, since for some reason this assumption is made in a lot of ""i'm virgin at 20+ years"": I have empathy, I can read body language, I can make people feel comfortable (except of course for some occasional awkwardness that I guess happens to everyone), a lot of friends love to discuss with me about their most private things because I'm a good listener.

I'm 5'10 tall (179 cm), I live fully by myself since I was 19, I dress nicely for all occasions (formal, sport, casual), I work and earn decent money, I'm kinda skinny but most of my mass is muscle and I've made huge improvements. I can cook, I can diet. I'm good at taking photos and editing them (studying photography in my spare time now), I can live alone, I can clean well my house and I know how to do all the house and tax stuff. I can grind in most areas of life, not only gym: I have a computer engineering degree, I studied by myself five frameworks and programming languages. I have a C1 certification in English language and B1 in French. I've been travelling and seeing friends and new people lately, I have lived properly my teenage years (except for love) and I can't recall of a single summer day spent at home. I'm very loyal, I'm a good friend, I'm sociable when in the right setting. I've recovered from a surgery and a full blown depression... And yet I'm full of inferiority complexes, I still feel like my life and my persona is utter garbage and I still feel like I'm an inept. I still act normal socially, even though I'm of course not over-confident, yet I still feel that I'll be this way forever and nobody and specifically no girl would be attracted to me. I still fear rejection cause I still fear to get kicked into depression again, no matter how many qualities can back me up. I don't act like a weirdo or a loner, yet I still feel like I am for some reason. I usually don't downplay myself when I talk to others, at least not excessively, even though I'm not constantly praising myself either...

So, lately I've decided to do something about my non-existent love life. Before, I would just refuse to even think to approach a girl, but now I'm starting to really crave it. But it's very hard when I have these obnoxious thoughts in the back of my head. Reading Reddit for advice doesn't help, since you find plenty of women that, past 20s, say ""I would never date a virgin guy, I need someone who knows very well what he wants, cause he had past experiences"", ""I don't want to be the teacher in bed at this age"", ""being virgin/dateless at 27 is a huge red flag"", ""Honestly, if you didn't date in 25 years of your life, have you ever lived?"". A lot of them also complain of creeps, catcalling (I've never complimented a girl in my life, let alone whistled at one in the streets lol) to the point that I would feel like a creep/weirdo approaching them no matter the situation. 

It doesn't help also that my social circle restricted lately, since after graduating, many friends I've made in this city left to work in other countries, and my lifelong friends live in a different city than mine. I do still go out 2-3 weekends per month, if I'm at my hometown for vacations even everyday, but even if we go to bars and squares, they're all the type of guys that prefer to stay in our group rather than approaching others. ""Bar culture"" in our country it's actually about enjoying a drink yet staying in the same circle, like in a gym: you go there to workout and do your stuff, not to talk to others. So even if I was at a bar, I would perceive approaching other people in general (not only girls) as kinda awkward and challenging. It may be doable in general, but impossible for me in my condition. Clubs and discos are different, but I don't go there anymore since I was 24, I kinda feel too old for that stuff now since they're full of teenagers.

So, is it really over (it never ever bagan actually lol) for me love-wise? Is my lack of experience unredeemable? Are my qualities useless when girls are faced with my inexperience? Is my situation a ""no-go"" for all women? How can I push myself out there if I fear rejection so much?How can I not look like a creep if I wanted to start knowing a girl at the gym, for example? Having no sexual experience at 27 is the ultimate turn-off? Is having low self-esteem and psychological scars a complete turn-off even if I can still act and be normal in social situations?  


TLDR: dateless at 27, low self-esteem, trying to recover but can't make use of my qualities. Kinda normal guy except for the non-existent love life. Feeling like I'm going to be alone forever trapped in dysfunctional thoughts.",dating
2098,Ladies how do you feel about men ordering for you?,"Soooo im 21 years old, i took a break from women and friends completely for the past few years to focus on building. now that everything is going good financially im looking to start having fun again and start dating. 

But this dating game is a lot different from pulling women in high school ngl. in high school you can literally get with women without ever taking them out.  Ive seen a lot of women say they want the man to do all the talking on dates and order their food. Is this true? why wouldnt they just speak? how would i know what they wanna order? that isnt too much? lol",dating
2099,I had a super gorgeous girl match with me only for her to say hi and unmatch after my response.,"So this young 19-21 (I forgot the exact age) gal matched with me, I’m 23, she said “hi👼” she didn’t have much to go off of but maybe a cute picture at the beach and I didn’t think of anything creative to say, but my (probably boring response) was “Hi, how has your day been lately?”   (Really I meant to say how has your day been so far) 

Do women like more of the upfront type of guys more than the standard / “boring” guys?  

Again she was stunning and it sucks this happened but it’s whatever since I’m sure I’ll get more matches in the future.

I’m assuming she might have just been looking for fun / to waste time??


Edit, I messaged her on IG just asking if she was from the area and she said yeah her and her parents are, so maybe I have a chance ?? Idk, she didn’t follow me back on IG so I’m wondering if she really could be a bot / or she could be wanting more followers. 

Edit #2: For everyone telling me it was a bit bizarre to “go searching for her”, I get that, but I didn’t go searching for her, she actually had her IG in her bio and I followed soon after I saw we matched before any convo happened. Just thought I’d mention that.
(Which I probably shouldn’t have done in the first place as that probably makes me look desperate)

Edit #3: somehow she matched with me again on bumble and messaged me back..like what.",dating
2100,How do people deal with heartbreak?,"I’m freshly heart broken, like only a few hours fresh and just really need to vent and get words of wisdom. I’m (26f) a late bloomer, I didn’t start dating until 25. I have a lot of reasons for not dating in the past and stacked together they led to me waiting until 25. In the last year and a half I have only met two people I was genuinely attracted to and interested in. 

The first guy ghosted me after 3 fantastic dates and lot of calls and texting. I took it really badly. I knew my reaction was disproportionate and ended up in therapy partially because of it. 

I kept dating and kept not having connections, there were some perfectly nice handsome guys I just was not attracted to them and always ended things before they really went anywhere. 

6 weeks ago I finally met someone I was attracted to. I left the first date feeling giddy, which I hadn’t felt since the ghoster. From there things only got better, our second date ended up being very emotionally intimate and I basically laid out all my baggage. Which included never being in a serious relationship or having sex. He wasn’t scared off. Sharing the things I thought someone might reject me for so early made everything so much more comfortable and easy, from my perspective at least.

We continued dating and ended up sleeping together. So he was my first everything except for kiss. For me sex was always the main thing that held me back from developing relationships so to overcome that fear was a major step. 

Fast forward to today, we are supposed to go on a date. I’m preparing in my head to actually have the where is this going conversation. I end up getting a text basically saying he thinks we shouldn’t see each other because we are in different places and want different things and he is looking for a serious relationship. He thinks if we keep seeing each other emotions will get too complicated. I’m surprised, this is definitely not something I expected to hear and point out that we hadn’t talked about this and if we had you’d know that a relationship is what I want too. In the end it came down to that I haven’t been in a serious relationship in the past and he can’t commit or continue seeing someone who hasn’t had the growth and learning experiences that come with a relationship. 

I’m devastated, he told me repeatedly that he thinks I’m great and enjoyed our time together. I know that he started the conversation with his mind made up already, and there is/was no changing. Its really heartbreaking to hear that this thing I was worried about and brought up so early is what is the issue. I had a gut feeling I would end up heartbroken, not having a previous longterm relationship is not at all what I saw coming though. I can’t imagine feeling so safe and willing to be vulnerable with anyone else. This shit is so hard I don’t understand how people can just wipe themselves off and get back out there.",dating
2101,"Women, would you expect the man you’re dating to pay for your gas for your car?","Personally as a man (26M), I wouldn’t do that at the present moment because I’m in law school (which is expensive as it is) and I’m working for minimum wage right now. On top of dates, gifts and gas prices being insane right now where I live, I can’t afford it. 

However, if I was more financially stable, I’d do it.

Edit: I didn’t expect this much of a response and people seem to be making assumptions so let me clarify a few things. 

1. What I mean by paying if I was more financially stable is just doing it every now and out of courtesy especially if she drive a long way to come and see me. 

2. Some of y’all that are accusing me of being into sugar babies need to lay off the crack! It’s fallacious to equate paying for gas as being sugar daddy. 

3. I asked the question in the title initially because I heard some woman from what I presume is the US, getting pissed at her man for not paying for gas and I didn’t know if people actually do that in the US or elsewhere.

4. By “gifts”, I’m not saying I’m buying her shit everyday. What I’m saying is on special celebratory occasions, I want to get her something nice and within my budget but I can’t do that IF (key word here is IF) that expectation of paying for gas exists. Also even if I was more financially stable, I would not shower my partner in gifts. I’m not her ATM.",dating

2103,Venting about never being the first choice,"24 F

LOL I am so fucking lonely
Recently my activities have consisted of hyper fixation on old Hollywood actresses and their tragic lives because secretly part of me wants to see myself in them. Every guy I’ve ever had feelings for has chosen some other girl over me.
I can’t even be mad at the other girl because she’s just what he wants. But here’s the thing that fucking kills me inside:
If she’s the one that he wants, why does he even fucking bother me in the first place?? I make it very clear I am a good person, loving, loyal, and have my own unique personality and interests. I have integrity, yet guys always choose the next fucking girl that looks at them. 
What did I ever do to deserve this endless fucking cycle of being chosen and then left for someone else. It was shitty the first time but over and over again starts to feel like hell. Like I am living in my own personal hell. 
I’ve taken up so many fucking hobbies I could write a book about the things I’ve taught myself to do. I’ve cultivated self love through hardships, taught myself how to sew, embroider, paint, knit, how to use herbs. I am beginning to fucking hate myself, 

I am never the first choice. 

Even by those who are my first choice.

I don’t have ridiculous standards either

The guys I’ve been with aren’t the best looking guys by society’s definition but *I*think they’re handsome. I never did care about what society thought about who I’m attracted to, though I know most people *do* care

Not lying, cheating or decieving but being honest, forthright and a being a good listener. Genuine people are a rarity because society teaches us to think hive mindedly and value and worship the material over the spirtual. Living in a technology driven era in human history seems to perpetuate narccism and degrades are sense of self worth making it almost impossible to find someone with equal values, morals and integrity.",dating

I've been rejected for test tubes and single motherhood as a better option now.

3. Find a healthy way to resolve conflict 
4. Accept ur partners flaws and help them
5. Accept your own flaws and ask for help

I keep meeting really great people, connecting with them A LOT and pretty deeply, but then after awhile it slows down and I’m drug along or I’m ghosted 🤷‍♀️ maybe it’s my past insecurities but I keep making these connections and they don’t go anywhere. I can’t help but question if it’s because I’m tall and plus sized cause everything else flows when I’ve met these people.

2108,My (23) gf (23) wants me to pay for all dates. Is it reasonable?,"Long story short:

I have no relationship experience beforehand. 
She wants me to pay for all the dates and we’re together for like 10 months.
I don’t really feel comfortable doing so.
I do want to spoil her and make her feel good but I don’t feel like it’s cool when I pay for everything.
She claims she dresses up for me, makes her hair, nails, body hair, beautiful clothes, lingerie and stuff and she expects me to pay.
I also take care of myself, haircuts, gym, supplements, taking care of the car I’m driving us to places, buying myself some good clothes, boxing lessons (I want to feel more confident and to be able to protect her), therapy. I’m helping my mother with money stuff.

Shes makes the same amount of money I’m making. 
She’s claiming that she will be raising the children, cooking all day, cleaning when we get married (we’re not planning to in the next few years).
It kind of worries me to be honest.
I don’t mind providing for the house but for now that’s not the case.
She’s claiming she wants to feel as if she is being romanticized by me by taking her on dates.
She said that because I currently have no money then she is fine with doing smaller dates but I should still pay.
She even said that because at some times I wasn’t the one who took the initiative and asked for the date, thoughts about the details, then I should be the one to pay for it.

I grew up without lots of money and it annoys me this behavior.

2110,I’m afraid of dating and sex,"I’m 20f, a virgin, and I’ve become increasingly afraid of sex. I’m worried that in order to not die alone, if I meet someone I like, I’ll have to rush myself to have sex before im ready in order to keep them. With what I keep hearing about dating nowadays, I feel like my attitude towards waiting a bit for sex (not marriage. Everyone assumes I mean marriage for some reason as if it is either sex on the third date or waiting until marriage as if an in between doesn’t exist…I mean like give me a month or two? Is that asking too much?). I feel like any actual autonomy I have over my body has to be waived if I actually want to find someone. And, as I get older, I feel like the pool of people willing to give me time before hopping in bed is just getting smaller.

Whenever I ask people for advice, im always told that im going to struggle to find someone. Despite the fact that technically I don’t *have* to have sex with someone before im ready, the choice doesn’t actually feel like a real choice. If I don’t want to be alone forever, I don’t have much of a choice other than to risk traumatizing myself by sleeping with someone before im ready.

I feel gross and I hate myself. I hate myself for not being like everyone else. I hate myself for being such a fucking prude but I cannot help what im comfortable with. I feel like I have no real choices. I don’t know what to do and the entire idea of ever having sex just terrifies me at this point. What do I do?

I feel like I have to choose between dying alone or traumatizing myself. It’s not a fun choice to try to make.

Edit: I appreciate all the reassuring response. I’m trying hard to listen to those and not the one that told me I must be ugly and unlikeable for disagreeing with them on their views on sex….(which I explicitly stated was a matter of preference and neither of us are right or wrong).

I was always 110-120lbs up until 3 years ago, and the way people have treated me since the weight gain has really changed my perspective on people. I’m afraid that because I’m heavy, people don’t care as much about who I am as a person. And I’m not sure how much of this is in my head, but I can’t help seeing all the horrible rhetoric about fat women. It definitely makes me second guess the intentions of men who show interest. Especially with this last guy, because he’s really fit and attractive. I don’t understand what he could possibly see in me, attraction-wise (as we share extremely niche interests)

I guess I just want to get out of my head and be optimistic in the possibility that he just genuinely likes me…but my insecurity is holding me back.

Do attractive men really find interest in people below their “league” (sorry I know this whole post reeks of insecurity, I’m just so nervous about the whole thing and while I’m working on losing weight I’d like to still be able to date in the meantime.)

2126,my boyfriend (m19) recorded me (f18) without permission while i was drunk.,"me (F 18) and my boyfriend (M 19) have been dating for 2 months recently booked a hotel room for a night so we could spend some time together before we leave our seperate ways for college as i intend to leave the country. 

everything had been going perfectly fine until, we decided to drink and we bought 2 bottles of beer. now, i have and extremely low alcohol tolerance and can easily get tipsy with one bottle of beer and him on the other hand has a very high alcohol tolerance. so naturally, soon i was pretty dizzy and my head felt heavy.

we were cuddling and then eventually we ended up having sex. i was on top of him while it was happening and because my head was dizzy and heavy, it was resting on his chest. i didn't notice it earlier but he had been recording us having sex. when i realized what he was doing i immediately stopped and took his phone away and went on to delete everything. i was pretty angry at it especially because he did not ask for consent before doing AND he knew i was drunk (hes also asked me this before and he knows that i dont like being recorded while having sex).when i yelled at him for doing it, he apologized and started crying, saying he didn't mean to and he was sorry. i wasnt feeling too well after that so i let it go and we went to bed. 

the next day after i came back home, the entire thing was replaying in my head over and over again and idk but it made me feel so weird and uncomfortable and it made me lose some part of my trust in him. i was crying and i decided i should call him to talk to him about it. 

i called him and i said what he did made me really uncomfortable and upset and i wanted to know why he would do it. he just said that he doesnt know why he did it and said sorry once. then he proceeded to tell me that i dont trust him at all and that if i did we wouldn't have been having this conversation. he said, and i quote, ""do u not trust me with your body? theres nothing to cry about, its clear that u dont trust me at all"". he proceeded to say that its always his fault and that hes always in the wrong. when i said that, i dont think i trust u anymore after you did that without asking me first,, he said ""do whatever tf u want to"" and hung up on me. 

he had also made rape and SA ""jokes"" throughout the night and it really triggered me since I'd had a really traumatic experience only 5 months prior. i was pretty pissed at him for it but he just said that im looking into it too much and im overreacting.

idk im really exhausted and upset with all of this. i had never expected him to do something like that ever. my friends said that i should break up with him but what if i AM overreacting or looking into it too much? what should i do?",dating

2128,"(F) Why do men ""fall in love"" so quickly?","I haven't had many situationships or talking stages but what has happened to all of them is that the guy I'm talking to, ""falls in love"" with me in less than a month, and lovebombs me, tells me how amazing I am, wants to see me everyday, and stuff. It has happened to me more than once, why are they like that?

I like to take things slowly and get to know eachother with time. Even if I, at that moment, think that the person is amazing, I dont say it because I want to get to know them better before jumping into conclusions and to anything more serious, bc that's really when you start to see that person's true colors.

I don't think they are consciously ""lying"" about it but after a few months they suddently stop with that treatment and even get defensive when I bring up the fact that they used to be so attentive and now they're not.

I want to put a disclamer, I'm not talking about all men or talking about it in an agressive way. It's just I kind of behaviour I've been encountering and I dont know how to deal with it. Do you really fall in love? Or it's just a rush of dopamine you get from meeting someone new? I'm tired...

Edit: forgot to mention how that makes me feel. At the beginning is a bit of a turn off, because I'm aware they're just idealizing me and our relationship since in the beginning everything is usually great. But as weeks go by and they keep lovebombing me I get used to it and feel great to have someone giving me all these attention and compliments constantly. Until they suddently shut and I feel like shit because all that love is over and I always wonder why, what has gone wrong or what have I done wrong

2129,Epiphany: you must first be happy,"This is for all the singles feeling sorry for themselves and coming up with reasons beyond their control for why they are alone: Don't vent to strangers. Do things you love. Chase happiness that requires no one else, and do not prioritize sex. Relationships find happy people and miserable people are not fun to be around. Go be happy instead of making excuses and making yourself miserable over things you cannot control.

2130,A 2-month-situationship hurts more than my 6-year relationship.,"I recently ended a 2-month-situationship, and it hurts so much more than ending my 6-year relationship.

Perhaps it’s the “what-ifs” and “potentials” that make it difficult to move on. 

I genuinely thought that he was the one. It’s the love that comes when you least expect it. It’s the love that showed me that I am capable of loving someone deeply again—the love which proved to me that feeling safe and secure is possible. 

But it’s also the love that required me to choose myself and set my boundaries. 

I could have kept my feelings to myself. But I knew doing so would repeat a toxic cycle I had tried to end for many years. 

It sucks. Because despite having other people who admire you, despite having so many options, it’s the one person your heart is longing for, whom you cannot have. 

I’m still grieving the loss of this relationship. I 
usually have a positive outlook in life and believe that all things happen for a reason. But for now, I still can’t reframe my thoughts and perspective on this. 

——


Maybe in another lifetime, my love. For now, I’ll have to let you go. May you continue to flourish and bring hope and love into this world. I wish you knew how worthy you are of love. 

I hope someday you get to love yourself the way that I love you. But for now, I have to say goodbye. I will see you on the other side, my love.",dating
2131,My partner wants me to give up my spiritual beliefs,"For context,  I believe in God. I just don't follow traditional Christianity and practice a more esoteric and occult way of life.  He is agnostic, not really sure of a higher power,  and follows no religion whatsoever. 

How would you deal with a partner that asks you to give up your spiritual beliefs because they think you're ""devil worshipping""?  He's the love of my life and it's coming from a place of care but when I tried to explain how my spirituality works and what I believe in he immediately dismisses me. He accuses me of being schizophrenic and feels like he has to ""save me"" from this lifestyle. When in reality this lifestyle saved me and lifted me up everytime he hurt me in the past.   But now that we've been having talks about us becoming serious he blames my anxiety on my spiritual beliefs instead of addressing his dismissive and avoidant behavior which I've told him hurts me but he deflects. 

Tldr: bf calls my spiritual beliefs nonsense and blames our relationship problems on them but won't address his own dismissive behavior.",dating
2132,Had a first date with that girl and I'm puzzled about how it went,"I had a first date with a girl, it went well but she ""refused"" to kiss towards the end, and I don't know how to feel about that  
  
We live in the same neihgborhood and one thing leading to another we started talking when we crossed each other in the street and she followed me on instagram. So we start talking and I asked her to have dinner out  
  
It was a good date as we spent around 3 hours together, the discussion flowed naturally with many physical subtle touching since the beginning. She also said couple of times that she wanted to stay longer with me, so I interpreted all those signals as interest from her and tried to escalate the physical intimacy, but when I initiated a kiss towards the end of the date she refused.  
  
I didn't retry nor did I ask why she refused, but I'm a bit confused about that, because she presented many signals that she's interested (following on instagram, physical contact since beginning, looks she was giving me)  
  
Was it too soon for me to initiate a kiss during that first date ? Did I miss something here ?",dating
2133,"""I'm not ready for a relationship right now""","I (M) talked to this girl on Hinge for about a week and met up a couple days ago. Conversation was great, she was super cute, I got her number and we moved off-app pretty quickly, and she confirmed with me before the date that we were both looking for the same thing: a long-term relationship.

&#x200B;

The date was amazing. One of the best I've ever been on. We talked about so many things and the vibe the whole time was really fun and flirty. We were making plans to meet up later in the week and everything seemed to be going really well. She seemed like a really honest and genuine person and we talked about a lot of things that I wouldn't expect to talk about on the first date. We got dinner, walked around the town, made out on a bench. I walked her back to her car with plans to meet up at her place the next day. She texted me when she got home and thanked me for a great night.

&#x200B;

She texted me good morning the next day. Things were continuing much as they had before the date. She said she had a headache after work and wanted to take a nap, and I had no reason not to believe her. She texted me a few hours later saying she was feeling better, so I asked what her plans were for the evening, expecting her to invite me over. Instead, she said she had a great time last night but realized she isn't looking to date. She assured me it's not me, she just isn't ready for a relationship right now.

&#x200B;

I was really blindsided by this and I've been hurt and confused since she told me. I haven't gotten this many green flags from a date in a long time, and we had great chemistry in person. I just can't wrap my head around it. I know she either isn't into me, which doesn't make sense to me given the vibe on the date, or she's seeing someone else and didn't want to tell me, which could make sense. Or she's telling the truth. Maybe she's just scared of commitment.

&#x200B;

I know there's nothing I could have done to change her mind, and I don't think there's anything I would have done differently. It's just really frustrating and confusing to have that kind of chemistry in person and get nothing but green flags for the whole night into most of the next day only for her to change her mind. I know it was literally one date, but I hadn't felt this way about anyone in a long time. I guess I appreciate her letting me know instead of ghosting me. I'm going to take a break from dating for awhile, and I'm sure I'll feel better given a bit of time, but this whole situation is really frustrating and confusing. I wish her all the best and I hope she finds happiness in whatever way she needs, but I really thought we could have had that together. It feels like I'm setting myself up for failure when I get excited about dates at all anymore, because there's a chance of something like this happening. It just sucks man",dating

We’ve made it obvious to each other that we like each other but we haven’t even kissed yet, much less had sex.

2137,Saving sex for commitment,"I am 28f and quite frankly am exhausted from the past decade of heartbreak, abusive relationships and casual sex. I had this awakening moment recently after a guy left me for his ex and then the next said he only wanted casual after we went on a few dates and had sex. If I have feelings for someone and want more I don’t think I want to have sex with them until they state that they want a commitment with me. 

Obviously saving sex for a commitment doesn’t prevent the guy from ditching right after, but god dammit at least you have the dignity of saying we were together, he made it known we were together and I upheld a standard for myself. It is so heart breaking to be with a guy, but have no label for some bullshit reason and the next week see them giving a girlfriend everything you wanted. 

Part of me is sad that the days of fun casual sex are ending because I’m aware that that is a sacrifice, but I don’t think my heart can take it anymore. Withholding sex for a commitment also makes things so much less confusing. I definitely struggle with CPTSD and self discipline to saying no to pleasure right now which ends up hurting my long term goals. If I don’t do things differently I truly see myself in a decade being in this exact position.

Like if I start talking to a girl, flirt with her, try to escalate things, in the back of my mind, I already assume that she's going to reject me. And then I like the actual flirting part, but then as we part ways, I get this darkness that nothing is going to work, and What can I even provide her? My life is boring, I don't know how to open up, talk about feelings, be in a relationship, which makes me just not contact her anymore.

2143,How true is the phrase “the right one won’t care”?,"I’m a pretty anxious guy, I have a lot of insecurities that relate to dating and sex. I’m working on fixing them, but it’s very hard and they’ll always be in the back of my mind. Whenever I read or hear advice, whether it be on the internet or in real life, I always get the phrase “the right girl won’t care.”

“The right girl won’t care that you’re a virgin.”

“The right girl won’t care about your looks.”

“The right girl won’t care about your size ‘down there’.”

“The right girl will love you for who you are.”

I see this literally everywhere for every insecurity I have. In your experience, how true is this? I feel like it’s something people say to make others feel better like “There’s a lid for every pot” or “There’s someone for everyone”. I don’t know, it’s just hard for me to picture someone putting up with my lack of relationship experience.

2145,Why is it so difficult to find a Girlfriend/ and date,"This seems to be the hardest thing in the world to me. I’m getting older and am starting to freak out that I will be alone forever. I haven’t always had such difficulty dating. I have been in relationships when I was younger, was engaged at one time. I have been on dates, though not within the past year. I work for myself and don’t interact much except online.

How are so many people dating? Is it just being close to each other and working with each other? I never get a match on Tinder, very rarely get a match on FB dating. I comment on woman’s posts I am friends with on FB and get responses, but that doesn’t go anywhere. 

I’m not Brad Pitt or anything, but I have seen guys who dress like slobs be with beautiful women. What does it take? Is it how I look?

I can’t take u to a bar or to my friend’s group.  He was literally uncomfortable with me not drinking and ultimately said he couldn’t match w a girl that doesn’t drink.  Just to be clear - I never stopped him from drinking or pushed anyone not to drink.  I don’t preach, it’s just something I don’t personally do.  Is it really that big of a turn off guys?",dating
2147,Turns out I might just be gay,"I'm pretty sure I've figured out why it just doesn't ever seem to work with the men I date: I might be a lesbian. 

I had this epiphany in a very awkward way, while kissing the guy I was out with last week. He was sweet, objectively good-looking, and ticked all my boxes on paper. There is not one single thing wrong with him, I just felt repulsed by the whole thing. Which was wild - again, he's great. 

But it hit me that I feel that way *all* the time when I'm out with men, and I don't feel that way with women. Idk, I think it was partly my religious upbringing that was sticking with me this whole time; it was fine for me to say I was bisexual, but some deep part of my psyche thought that I *needed* to date men for some reason. Like, I couldn't actually act on any interest I had in women, even though it was like pulling teeth for me to date men and just wasn't fulfilling at all. 

So I started exclusively talking to women, and it feels kinda life-changing. I actually *want* to meet up, I feel interested, I feel excited. Everything I was ""supposed"" to feel when going out with men before, I feel. The excitement and hope that there's actually some substance there and it might go somewhere, I feel that! Lmao, it seems so silly that I am only recognizing this now, at almost 28. I feel like most people realize they're gay so much sooner. But It's one of those ""duh!"" moments and it feels like suddenly everything makes sense. I'm still single, but I don't feel like I'm trying to fit myself into a mold that doesn't accommodate me anymore.",dating

2151,5 years with no feelings.,"I (32 f) have been single for 5 years now. Somewhat on purpose but also, just never met anyone who really sparked with me.  This includes sexual partners. I’ve had one in the past 5 years and that was just an understood situation.

I’ve been married before and that was not a disaster, just that we wanted different things and are still friends. 

The last person I dated (post divorce) was a really amazing person, but ultimately broke it off with me because he felt I like him more than he did me. He had some other things to deal with and we still chat from time to time, but nothing romantic.   

Since then, I discovered I tended to have an anxious attachment style to people and wanted to heal that. Sometimes I feel like I went too far because now I just don’t feel attached to anyone. Now I just find peace in being alone, but I recognize that having a partner would be great. I’ve gone on a couple dates thinking “what could it hurt?”  And they just never really got passed the first date. I just wasn’t drawn.

I know there are plenty of men who would date me in a heart beat, but I just kind feel that’s because of their idealized version of me. And then I kinda start to think how annoying it would be if they flirted with me and stuff.

I wasn’t always like this. I guess I’ve just gotten so use to being alone.   I can’t say that I’m unhappy right now, but sometimes I do worry if there is something up with me for not really wanting anything with anyone.

I like dating, I feel I have learned a lot about what I like and don’t like and have enjoyed meeting others. But every time I “talk” to someone or starting casually dating someone it takes a huge toll on me. 

It usually goes like:

1. Talk on dating app
2. Move to messaging on text
3. Go on date
4. Things get sexual (edit: usually only one sexual encounter) 
5. They start to be inconsistent and detach
6. I get extremely upset and everything physically hurts

2159,"When someone is ghosting you, do you ask them why?","Curious how other people handle getting ghosted by someone you were pretty intimate and connected to, yet casually dating. Do you reach out to try and have a conversation? Do you block them and say screw it? Something else? Please share! 


My context: I’m (26F) being slow ghosted from a guy (26M) who a month ago was very obviously into me… 

without giving too much context I think we’ve been intimate enough to show more respect and have a conversation to end things. But he’s stringing me along and when I do reach out he seems normal again, but makes no follow through on plans. I’ve been trying to play it cool and be patient but at this point i think he’s ghosting me and is too afraid to just tell me it’s over for him, or whatever is going on in his head.

My instinct is to just call him and lay it all out on the table and ask for some honesty so it can just be over, but then other times I feel like he’s already shown me he’s not worth my time and I should just move on. I guess I need some sort of closure, but that could be a phone call or just blocking him on socials.

Update if anyone is wondering: 

Against all odds I opted to say something.. I tried to call and after having no response for a day I sent a text that basically said “I was hoping to chat to end things on a good note, ghosting someone is shitty and confusing and I feel like we had a connection that deserves at least a conversation to end it” 

I got an Immediate response that was explanation and apology, but no changes, to which I didn’t respond (I needed to digest), then I got a FaceTime later while I was at work. We planned to chat the next day and it went well and we just cleared up some misunderstandings and agreed that it wasn’t good timing and maybe we’ll see each other some other time. He seemed to genuinely not realize that he was making me feel shitty and felt bad about it. 

Overall- glad I had the hard honest conversation. Sure it was a bit humiliating to call and then text, but I refuse to feel ashamed for trying to communicate and ask for respect. 

I feel freer and lighter! Way better than blocking! I have closure, validation our romance real, and a good feeling about our connection.

Two of my close childhood guy friends are very successful— one is in medical school, another just got accepted to Harvard Law. I’m super happy for both of them, I almost cried when I heard the news about the HL acceptance haha. But this got me wondering a little bit.

I currently have a BA in Music, and am currently working as a Department Office Assistant and Orchestral Manager at my alma matter. It’s okay pay, but I really enjoy it, I wouldn’t trade it for any other job. I’m also trying to get an MBA degree through the university tuition waiver program. 

My goal in life, I know, old fashioned, is to have a family. I’m not expecting to be a stay at home mom because that’s difficult in America, but I want to be able to see my kids and raise them with lots of love. Make lunches with cute notes, maybe bake cookies for them every once in a while, etc. This view really clashed with careers like surgery and law, so I was never interested in pursuing it. Right now, if I’m patient I can remain in the State Administrative field for maybe 10 years and it’ll be a stable 6 figures. The job is perfect balance in my opinion if I want children too, as with my college there’s a bit of freedom (can leave early for childcare responsibilities). 

Tldr; ow much does a women’s degree matter in the general dating pool? I’m unsure if my goal of being at least a part-time housewife is too old-fashioned in 2023.",dating
2163,Men in their early 30’s: is it common or rare to want to settle down?,"29F.

I’ve been single for 2 years, before this I was in a relationship since 18. I took the time to heal, and went to therapy and since I was obviously in a extremely long relationship at a young age, taking up majority of my 20’s.

Now that I’m on the other side and ready to date, is it true that majority of men in late 20’s early 30’s aren’t ready to seriously commit and settle down?

I just want to know if I’m wasting my time being unrealistic that men aren’t really looking for that since they’re in their “prime”.",dating
2164,Men and Women- Do you de-screen romantic partners based on sexual acts they are unwilling to perform?,"Good evening everyone,

We all know finding a partner you are just WILLING to go on ONE date can be difficult enough. Very often, sexual discussions may or may not come up until after the first date- sometimes WELL after the first date.

Then sometime down the road the clothes come off and the conversations and actions about sex ramp up. Often the first interaction of sex will make/break the relationship from continuing on…

My bottom line- do people embrace the sexual *mindset* upfront over the sexual *acts* performed? Curious because it seems like someone can invest several dates, lots of time before even KNOWING what they are getting into in this arena.

For me- I value the mindset and open-mindedness and am willing to give a partner several go-around before judging they might not be the one.

Any thoughts or comments on this?",dating
2165,I've only ever dated 3 women and I'm now 27. Have I been left behind?,"So a long time ago, back when I actually had some type of confidence. I was able to strike up a conversation with a girl.

2166,To what extent are situationships the norm now?,"Forgive me for asking a question which to many of you might be extremely obvious, but I have far less experience than most people here. I'm not asking about online dating necessarily as I've never used it. 

Obviously it will depend on culture and age group. I'm early 20s living in Western Europe for context. 

I used to think that if something looks like a relationship then that's what it is. But I've learned the hard way that even if someone asks you out on dates, spends a lot of time talking with you, indicates that they're emotionally attracted to you, has sex with you, that by default it's this ambiguous state between friends with benefits and a relationship unless  defined as otherwise. 

I thought that not too long in the past, if you do these kind of things with someone without having the intention of being in a relationship with them then you're leading them on. But now nobody (even seemingly nice people) seems to have moral qualms about this and if anyone makes assumptions based on another person's behaviour then it's their fault when they're proven wrong.",dating
2167,Is a month of dating too soon to make it official?,"I've been seeing this guy for about a month, a date every week. I think we're going to continue this ""a date every week"" thing and I cut off all the other guys after the first date with him bc I liked it so much and I don't like seeing a lot of people at the same time lol. 

He seems pretty serious about me, talking about the next dates while we are on the current one, planning on meeting each others friends, what will we get for our birthdays, etc. Our situation is a bit specific but I don't want to reveal too much so in a sense I do see why he would rush it a bit if he wants to make it official. 

Also we haven't had sex, when we kiss he doesn't grab me anywhere sexual, doesn't stare at my boobs or butt, doesn't make sexual jokes nothing so idk if that adds anything to this. 

He hasn't asked me anything directly yet but he's giving me a lot of hints. What do you guys think is 1+ month a bit too soon for a relationship? Would that ruin the future of the relationship?",dating
2168,People who remain friends with their ex: why?,"I don't get it. Sure, if you have children, absolutely. Or maybe you were friends before the relationship and it was very short before you realized it wouldn't work.

But why do people stay friends with an ex they had a multi-year relationship with? I understand it feels good because they know you very well, but the reason why they know you very well is *precisely because* you used to be super close and shared everything.

To me it seems a little disrespectful to your next partner, who will feel *at least a bit* uncomfortable with the idea, especially if you see them 1 on 1 as close friends. It also makes me wonder if you ever gave yourself the chance to get over the relationship. Transitioning from a relationship to friendship may ease or delay the grieving process.

I personally don't keep my exes around because I just don't see a valid reason, it hurts to let them go but that's part of life and moving on. I also don't shit where I eat though (co-workers, friends etc) so it's easy for me to distance myself from an ex if the relationship is over.

2175,A guy pulled a 180 on me,"Hi,  
  
Met a guy one month and a half ago. It was supposed to be a one night stand. However we got along well and he started acting genuinely into me, texting me even though he knew we would't be able to see each other. We started talking almost every day and I was open to see where it could lead us. We saw each other a few more times and he constantly acted the same way, holding my hand, stealing kisses. I've had guys who didn't want anything serious and guys who wanted relationships, he acted way more like the latter. Last time he came over it was during the day so a different setting. He asked if he could come earlier that we agreed on and cooked something which I thought were all green flags. No change of behavior, he even texted me after he came back home.  
  
Then two days later I noticed he blocked me. I have done nothing wrong and it's pretty immature so I used my profesional phone to ask what was up. He told me he had starting seeing a girl he was already talking to at the time he came over. I though, fair enough, I don't like that but we're not a couple and people like to gauge their options. I answered 'that's a shame I would have liked to see where it could lead us, good luck with your exams.' I had my answer, sayonara. Then he said he liked me and had a great time with me but was afraid I was getting my hopes up and wanted something more. To wich I replied I barely knew him so no (and honestly not sure I want something serious with someone who can't communicate). He said that he felt bad and I noticed a few hours later he hilariously unblocked me. I asked ""I'm confused do we still see each other casually ?"" He agreed. ""That's what we were doing for me so do we change something"" ""No it's good as it is 😊"".

2176,"Alright, I am ready","Like many guys I have struggled with self esteem and confidence at times as an adult. I have often found excuses why no one would want to date me. They range from living at home with my parents, unemployed, too depressed. I have used these excuses to not even ask girls out for years at a time. 

I am 36 now and honestly in my 18 years of adulthood I have maybe tried to date for less then half that time. I was too ashamed to even try for one reason or another.

But now I live alone in my own townhouse. My mental health is as good as it has been in a long long time. I am in shape; I am at a super healthy weight. I have a full time job that I am not even looking to be promoted out of. So while I hope to have a bit more money in my bank account someday my relative earning power will never really go up. I am who I am, and I am proud of who I am right now.

I am 100% trying to date right now. I am fully on board with wanting a long lasting relationship and I know what I want and I know what I want my life to look like.

I am already registered to three online dating sites. I have told my parents and acouple of close friends I am wanting to date and be in a relationship. I am open to meeting people when I am out. And I am open to meeting people at work. I am fully committed.

2179,Hit on by a 19F as a 26M. Not sure if I made the right decision.,"This post is not meant to be a flex but I’m not sure if I made the right decision and would like input from the sub. 
To preface the situation I think it may be relevant that I’m currently living/working in a extremely rural area about an hour from a large city. 

This past weekend I visited the main campus of my university to hang out and visit with other members of the department in an official capacity. 
A small group of us went out on Saturday night to catch up and have fun. At one of the bars we visited, I saw a girl I though was cute but, as I’m a bit introverted and was with friends/ colleagues, did not talk to her. As I was hanging out with my friends, she walked up and started talking to me. She said she thought I was cute, and I told her I thought she was as well. It turned out that she was living in the city an hour away from where I was working. Then came the bad part… she asked my age (26)and when I told her, she said she was 19. She said it didn’t bother her if it didn’t bother me. 
I ended up telling her that I didn’t think it was a good idea for us to do progress any further(not exact words but that was the idea).One of my work friend definitely wing-women’ed me (I guess it would be important to note the while doing this she did not know the girl was 19) so I’m not super concerned with how it would have appeared professionally. 
I guess I’m second guessing my decision and would be interested in this sub’s opinion on a couple points.
1) I feel like hooking up across a larger age difference is less creepy than dating across one. With that, I feel like I was really dumb at 19 and didn’t want to be a dumb mistake the girl made. Would a 26 to 19 be creepy as an ONS? Would it have been more creepy to get her number and text when we would both be sober? 
2) if anyone has experiences dating or hooking up across an age gap I would be interested to hear your opinion. Did all parties end up happy/ not hurt emotionally or feel taken advantage of?
Thanks for any feedback!",dating
2180,I feel like me and my bf are sexually incompatible,"I recently posted about my concerns regarding my boyfriend's potential porn addiction, and I received some helpful advice. However, I'm still feeling confused and hurt, and I could really use some further guidance.

To provide some context, whenever my boyfriend asks for sex, I willingly engage and cater to his desires. I even took explicit photos for him, exactly the way he likes them. Despite this, I've noticed that he still occasionally masturbates without involving me, and it deeply upsets me. I find myself questioning if I'm overreacting or if this points to a lack of sexual compatibility or even diminished feelings on his part.

What troubles me even more is that when I try to initiate sex, he often turns me down. It's disheartening to know that he actively decides to masturbate instead of embracing intimacy with me, especially when he knows I would be open to it.

I'm struggling to understand this dynamic and its implications for our relationship. Should I be worried about sexual incompatibility? Is this a sign that he doesn't feel the same way about me? I genuinely want to work through this, but I'm not sure where to start.

If anyone has been through a similar situation or has any insights, I would greatly appreciate your input. How can I approach this topic with my boyfriend without sounding accusatory or defensive? And what steps can we take to address this issue together?

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support.

TL;DR: In my previous post, I was told that my boyfriend might have a porn addiction. I've done everything possible to please him sexually, including taking explicit photos, but he still masturbates without involving me. When I initiate sex, he often turns me down. I'm unsure if this indicates sexual incompatibility or a change in his feelings towards me. Seeking advice on how to address this and work through it together.",dating
2181,"Is having paid sexual encounters a red flag, i’m a guy.","Hi. Sorry for the blunt title. But just wanted to seek advice of girls. Is it a bad thing to have paid encounters?

Actually wanted to ask, im a pretty straight up guy with some morals, i dont indulge in paid encounters as i run in a pretty good boy group before, but I was betrayed by a friend and he kind of snaked someone i dated and they became a thing in front of me while he was smirking my way. Was depressed for a while and did some stupid stuff to get back to being “ok” (yes paid stuff), smoking and a lot of weeping and sleepless nights.

Ill going into these intense isolated crying sprees from misinterpreted signals and end up freaking out anyone that has interest in me. I'm severely terrified of being alone and being abandoned. I feel like on some subconscious level I have so much self hatred that I can't believe what's in front of me and unconsciously try to destroy it. I hooked up with this absolute 10 2 months ago and ended up giving off a lot of the same red flags. She got creeped out and is now hooking up regularly with a friend of mine.

So turns out he is also super clingy, like literally just stares at me all the time, follows me from room to room when we are at my house and is always like kissing me and touching me no matter where we are and I'm not the biggest fan of PDA especially so early in the relationship because idk it just kinda feels forced at that point and yeah fuck that.
And yes he knows how I feel about PDA and all that and he still literally always does it. Even when I am obviously very annoyed by it and verbally telling him to cut it out. Still does. All. the. Time.
In a addition, he comes over to spend the night and then just like stays for days on end. I mean I do enjoying his company but like I need some of my day to my self. Like go home and I feel like I make it super obvious that I want him to like just go home for a bit but idk
I really liked him alot I thought and my sister and the rest of my family like him a lot and we are Facebook official and literally every time he speaks to me now I just get the ick. Help me.

We went out to a bar and saw one of his male friends and spent the night with him too, it was a good night. Ended up going back to my place and did the deed etc. 

He was telling me he had not long broken up with his child’s mum and that he’d just moved back in with his dad and it was looking for a place to stay, I offered a room at my place but said we’ll discuss it more when totally sober. 

He asked if we could wake up early and if I could drop him to his child’s mothers place to see his baby, which I did. 

He messaged after saying he had a great night and we’ll definitely have to do it again soon. He even video called me and showed me his baby etc. Then bang just went ghost. No explanation nothing. 

I’m guessing he got back together with his kids mother; but I just asked for an explanation but he left me on ghost. Didn’t block me or anything. Just assuming blocked my messages.

2197,We attract what we reflect,"As a relatively middle-aged person, I’m dishing out advice I wish someone would have told me in my 20s as I was stumbling through life.

Moved in with two previous boyfriends because we could split rent even though they were not right for me at all. 

Invest in yourself. The sooner, the better. 

It really is true; we attract people who are like mirrors to who we are. It can be what we’re comfortable with or what we need to work on. Consider your core childhood wounds. What are your triggers. Consider yourself as two people in one body: the logical rational side and the unconscious side (where the emotional dwell). Why are you chasing people who don’t want you? Why are you always people pleasing, apologizing, tiptoeing around emotions, or trying to save or change people? Write this down. Everyone has traumas and that’s okay — just learn what it is, deal with it, and understand how to move through it. You cannot physically heal until you acknowledge it and tell your subconscious it is safe and protected.

I cannot even tell you how many mistakes I’ve made in the past because I was so unhappy with myself and who I was as a person. Don’t be like me and go through hardships until you take a serious look at yourself, your relationships, and wonder why certain things haven’t worked out. It all goes back to you. Even if the other person was toxic and abusive — YOU chose to date that person. WHY. And start to invest in your emotional and physical health to change this hard-wired pattern. Everyone can change.

Dating is tough. Once I started to accept me as who I am I began to recognize the people who were trying to take advantage, or listened to the red flags earlier (that before I’d just ignore). It’s a lonely road because you realize how many people are all on different paths all at different points in the lives. Finding that spark or particular energy with another takes time. I’m willing to wait. I like me better now. 😊

I notice a lot of men staring at me for at least 7-10 seconds everyday. I am around 5’3, small waist, and thicker everywhere else, long hair etc. On average a lot of men speak to me and say I look beautiful/ attractive. They ask for my number which I typically give out to see if I’m compatible with the person who approached me. 

But for the men that WONT say anything and just stare or smile, I need to know what I should say to them. Most women say that smiling back will do it but sometimes it doesn’t 😩. If a man doesn’t approach me, I used to just take this as an indication that he wasn’t attracted/interested enough in me to ask for my number which may be completely true but in case I’m wrong I want to be brave and come on to them verbally even if I get rejected lol what’s some things I can say to get a guys number in case he actually is interested but just didn’t say anything? 

Note: I don’t want to come off as desperate or aggressive I know men don’t like that!! 😳

I thought of:

1. “Hey, are you married?”
2. “You’re so handsome.”
3. “Hey” 
4.”Hey, you are so attractive, do you have a girlfriend?”
5.I thought about giving them one of my business cards?? I have like two small businesses so I can maybe slide them one and say “please use for personal reasons only I want to get to know you” 🤣 But Idk 🤣😩

Help!!",dating
2199,"I (23f) initiated exclusivity talk, he (29f) wanted to have more conversations about it before deciding, what to make of this?","We have been casually dating for 1 1/2 months, 8-9 dates total, and I initiated the conversation. I have told him in the past that I plan on moving to a different state within the next year, he said he would like to as well but he owns a business and hasn’t figured out a way to move his business or find a way for the business to become self sufficient. 

After initiating the conversation, we had a long and serious talk about what a relationship would look like given our plans to relocate, age difference, life plans, and ends goals when it came to family, which are all similar despite me moving sooner than he would be ready for. 

He said that he likes me and it would be a no brainer if I wasn’t moving and that me leaving makes him feel unsafe and insecure if we were to start a relationship together.

He talked about his hesitancies and how things could go wrong while I focused on how we could realistically possibly make it work, and I asked him directly if he’s made a decision based off his many concerns, and he said no, that he wanted to have more conversations and clarity about it. 

This was 2 weeks ago. Our communication pattern has changed. We made plans a couple times to talk but they all fell through due to his busy schedule/lack of planning appropriately/lack of prioritizing the conversation. 

The distance between us has definitely grown, we stopped calling each other pet names and talking and seeing each other on a daily basis. I haven’t initiated because I feel like I made my intentions known and clear and it’s up to him to decide if he can meet me there or not. 

Should I take this as a sign of disinterest and move on? Or should I give him the benefit of the doubt and be patient?

Thanks!",dating
2200,am i wrong for giving up on getting a GF and focusing on things that would make me happy instead?,"ive struggled with depression for the past 5-6 years due to severe loneness and being ditched by people i thought of as friends. So, i tried to get a GF, and wasted up to 5 years trying my ass off to get a girl to like me enough that i could ask out, but being treated like trash by alot of women over the years did a number on my mental health and about a year ago i finally gave up completely and decided to spend money on myself and to buy/do things that will make me happy.

2201,I am so terrified of being single for years and years and years.,"I read the stories in this subreddit about folks who have been single for sometimes as much as a decade.  

After my long six year relationship ended, I have had to confront all the issues surrounding dating in the modern day.  I've had other dry spells in my life but the way these dating apps have pay walled everything, how its almost going against social norms to ask people out outside of dating apps, the sheer lack of viable people to start a relationship, the culture of dating in the modern etc.  Its like staring into an abyss.  Its seems like I am to weird, niche, and eccentric to be seen as an attractive candidate for almost everyone.    

I have to keep weathering the storm and keep trying if I want any kind of relationship.  I know this.  But the whole process is not fun and gives me psychic damage. 

Honestly.  I regret having any desire for companionship at all.  I want that part of my brain to be lobotomized.",dating

Part of me wants to hang out and just have fun and enjoy each other's company.  The other part of me wants to talk about how we each see dating and what that looks like so we're perfectly clear and then share ideas we each have for future dates.  She told me last night that she has tons of ideas and I have tons of ideas and we already kind of agreed that we would each do at least one idea from the other person's list that we hated.

It would be awesome to have a little feedback from you/statistic for myself 🤓

My question is: Are you attracted to guys who are tall and skinny? Or do you like muscular guys/guys on the chubbier side?

A couple of words to explain my situation: My metabolism is fast as hell, I've always been on the skinnier side. Well to be honest: I'm not on the skinnier side, I'm just skinny (I eat a lot, don't worry). Since a couple of years I do sports so I'm sort of defined as well. And I'm tall. Meanwhile I don't think there is a woman who is attracted to tall and skinny guys or am I on the wrong track?

I have attributed this to looking like a full adult woman. I find that now many men above 30 actively flirt with me. Those in their 40s and 50s do too, when before they absolutely did not. I am also much more directly flirted with. 

This is quite at odds with what I was told about men losing interest once a woman reaches 30. I feel my dating pool is the largest it has been. I'm wondering if other women have felt the same. I cannot exclude that maybe I have for some reason become better looking than I used to be; but I think I've remained quite the same, except for age specific issues: a few light wrinkles and the very occasional white hair.",dating

now i have told T that he is free to flirt, talk, have sex and so on with anyone he wants as long as im still the main subject of intrest and it has been vise versa.

i also told T that theres one female friend of our group of friends that i do not like and that i wish he wouldnt try anything with her since she is a person who ""collects"" men like some medals, T reasured me that nothing was happening between them and that it was only harmless flirting.

i found out few days ago and today that they have been having sex for 3weeks about and that T has also taken romantic intrest in her and also started talking romanticly with her trying to pursue a relationship and saying how me and him are most likely are gonna go back to being bestfriends.
i was distant for 3 ish weeks beacouse i had wifi issues and some mental healht problems i was trying to solve but during this time he was still loving and caring like nothing changed, and all of this has been happening without me knowing,
also for context we have usually let eachother know if we have done something sexual with another person and we have been very open to each other about our feelings and intentions.

only reason why i now know is beacouse the Girl told me and i think she thought i knew? obviosly i didnt and im unsure what to do and how to confront him about the situation beacouse he first of all lied to me and went back on his word and to be honest broke my trust slightly.

2214,Confused after first one-night stand (M22 F22 ),"So 2 days ago, I had my first one-night stand ever. I had some sexual experience before, but not a lot, and it was a few years in the past.I meet the girl in a climbing gym in my city, we started talking. (She is from North America, and I am from Europe). The vibe was good. I invited her to show her some more locally known spots that are unusual for tourists to see. We went out for a drink and then landed at my place. So I also have to mention that I wasn‘t extremely attracted to here instantly. I found here cute but nothing more. And it wasn‘t my intention to have sex, I just wanted to get to know here. Long story short, we had pretty wild sex. Btw. in a Shared Apartment with very thin doors. She left very early in the morning. I really enjoyed the night with here, but at first there was nothing more than that. On the next day, she wrote me on three separate occasions. And we started texting I little bit more. For me, it seems that she really likes me and even tough she lives on the other side of the planet really wants to meet me again. Later, she even asked me if we want to travel together in Summer. Overall, I’m very overwhelmed with what I should do with the situation. I did only know her for a few hours, so it‘s hard for me to even say if we are a good match. And just inviting here to travel with me together in summer seems kind of crazy. But I have to state that my feelings are really mixed up currently, and maybe I also have a little bit of a crush on her.

2216,"Being digital hoarder (photos of exs, toxic family, etc)?","Anyone similar?

I don’t see myself being able to just delete my old photos.

I have some sort of block that makes it hard even though I’m well over them.

But, I just see it as part of my history and I want to honour the memories and have them , appreciating that they happened… but knowing that being with that person doesn’t work.

I like having photos of the expensive trips I took even if exs were in them.

I don’t really even look at them… I find deleting old things hard.

Just going back and sorting through it all feels overwhelming.

And hitting the delete key is just something I find hard.

I just want to know I’m not alone.
I know some partners would find this unacceptable.

But, honestly for me in regards to a potential GF unless the person was using it as a shrine and idolizing it. I’d just accept it as part of history.

Is anyone else like me…?

And it’s not even that I’d ever want my exs back in my life. I’m happier alone

I just … have trouble parting with my past for some reason.

And it’s not just exs.

I look back on some of the times fondly though.

I have a family portrait hanging that includes a family member that completely betrayed us all in a sickening way. If anything it’d be photos of this person I’d destroy as she hurt us way more than any ex.

But, again I like to hold onto my history. Unless, it’s accidentally lost.

The act of destruction is hard for me.

I do turn off the ability for photos of my ex to show up in my memories though.

I know this is a dealbreaker for many.",dating
2217,Am i going to be single forever?,"I (25f) have been single for 3 years. I have only been in one serious relationship which ended up being very emotionally, spiritually and mentally abusive.  I have taken alot of time to get to know myself, figure out what i want, become comfortable on my own. I have spent time travelling solo, gone to therapy regularly. I live alone and im fully financially independent. I love adventure, hiking, travelling, music festivals and i just love life all together. I am a part time painter and i paint to be in galleries as well as make commissions. I have a very fulfilling life.  But i cant help but feel i have a big part of me missing somewhere out there.

All I've wanted since i was little was to find my soulmate. I know that sounds ridiculous but finding someone my soul just soars with, a partner in crime, someone to grow and laugh with, someone to build memories with is what I've always craved. 

With todays dating world, hookups and 'situationships' being so prevalent, i have avoided dating apps like the plague. The idea of meeting someone online feels unorganic and just not me. I have tried all the apps in the past and it usually ends with me deleting it because i just get multiple people a day commenting on my looks rather then who i am, which makes me feel like im not worth actually getting to know. 

I feel that alot of men are not willing to match the amount of effort and emotion that i want to put into a relationship. I also find alot of men disinteresting, and i feel like alot haven't put alot of work into themselves, so how would they be able to put work into someone else? I really wish there was some kind of magic ball i could ask and it would say 'dont worry girl, you will find your mate in 3years'... Unfortunately im using reddit as my backup. Does anyone have any advice or feel the same? Should i prepare to never be able to have children or find a reliable man with a strong connection?

2218,Girl I was dating was already involved with another guy,"So I started talking to this really sweet girl a few days ago and we pretty much instantly hit it off. We talked all day for several days, had some really amazing conversations with her and things were going so well that I asked her out. The next day we met and the date went amazing and we both wanted to see eachother again. We texted throughout the day same energy and everything until she didn't open my message for a couple hours and when she finally got back to me she apologized and told me that she was already talking to someone else and the reason she was talking to me was because he wasn't getting back to her but he finally did and she wanted to go talk to him instead. 

She felt bad and all and wanted to still be friends. She told me if it wasn't for the fact she was already talking to someone she would have wanted to pursue. I if course played it off cool but in reality I was pretty upset. I got my hopes up for nothing and she was already talking to some other guy to begin with. We still text eachother but irs not the same. I feel like almost everytime I like someone there's some BS that comes with it that makes it so we can't be together, it just feels so hopeless sometimes.

2230,How can I get comfortable enough to sleep with someone after only a few dates?,"
This isn’t a troll or me trying to shame people. Just the opposite. I (19F) have just started to date seriously and I admit I am a little naive and in serious need of advise. 

I hear that many people consider 3 dates to be enough to expect to go sleep with someone, assuming they don’t want to have sex on the first date. I’m a virgin and only just begun to really put myself out there, so I’m having trouble imagining how to be comfortable being so vulnerable and intimate with someone I’ve only met 3 times. How can I trust them to respect my body and my boundaries, if I’ve only known them for so little? 

I’ve heard advise saying that many men will assume that I’m not attracted to them if I’m not excited to sleep with them, but how can I be comfortable if I hardly know you? Some have said 3 dates is a long time, but surely it isn’t hard for someone to be inauthentic for 3 days if they don’t actually want something serious and just want sex, right? 

Also, some have said that they want to have sex asap to determine sexual compatibility. How would that work for me if I’ve never even had sex?

Is it unrealistic to expect a committed relationship before having sex? In my ideal world, I’d know I really like someone before taking that step, but I can’t imagine seeing the potential for love in a few hours. Would it be better for me to get over this hang up over sex if I want to date seriously? Brutal honesty and advise would be greatly appreciated. I promise I can take it ;)",dating

2232,Does putting an effort scare people or am in just finding unavailable women?,"Where do I begin? 24M here. So the last two women I dated ended up in a similar way. Both saying that Im just the right guy at the wrong time. They were scared when I put an effort. They were not ready for something serious.  For more context
Girl 1: I have met her on reddit. She was a mess when I found her. She came from a recent break up. We had chemistry. We talked, chatted and even sexted. But whenever the topic came to meet in real life, she said she needed more time. I was patient. It took nearly 8 months. She used to (initially atleast) call me crying, and I was giving her reassurance to calm her down. I was there when she needed me. She was scared that she couldn't reciprocate same and hence we decided to call off things. 


Girl 2: Breath of a fresh air. Met her at a local dating event. Again instant chemistry. Exchanged numbers, talked, took our time. We both established we want something serious. Went on a date, really lost track of time. She said she was having a bad day yesterday so I sent her a lasagna, she said she didn't know how to respond and that she was too happy. As we are planning for a second date tomorrow, got a text from her that it made her realise she is not ready for anything casual or serious. It's been a month since I met so I didn't think it was too soon for me to send her food.

Where am I going wrong? Since when putting effort scare people. 
If people wanna know, I follow rule 1 & 2 and have a good job and recently bought a car. So I'm doing fairly good for myself.

Don’t like the principal of getting husband expectations while we aren’t married. She’s not even willing to work with me on this. I plan on breaking it off Monday when she gets home. She’s currently staying at my apartment till Sunday. 

She didn’t do anything wrong per se… Her spending habits and mindset on money just don’t match up with my future goals, so she will be getting dropped. Partially my fault for incorrectly setting the tone at the beginning of the relationship..

2237,Am I wrong for wanting my bf to unfriend someone that makes me uncomfortable?,"My (f18) boyfriend (m17) has this friend… let’s call him R. I don’t know anything about R but his first and last name. I never liked him because he talked to my boyfriend about weird stuff, like other women, and my boyfriend always would ignore the subject of other women and such because he’s loyal to me. 

But R does a lot of drugs. Like- A LOT! My boyfriend struggled with addiction in his earlier teen years to cocaine, pills, and weed, and got over it. I’m scared that R is going to make him relapse. 

My boyfriend works at the park and so does R, they do maintenance at 10$ an hour (Until we move in a week to another town). R lives about a mile from the park. 

I told my boyfriend I wasn’t uncomfortable with him hanging around R because I didn’t know the extent of what he did. 

My boyfriend had to take R to his house to feed his dogs, and the man tried to pressure him into doing cocaine… THREE TIMES in 30 minutes he asked him.. Obviously I don’t want him hanging around him because he KNOWS the addiction my boyfriend had and he is trying to get him to get back in it? Nah.",dating
2238,Why don't people I [M24] ask out simply say 'no' when I ask them out?,"This is something that, not gonna lie, consumes me [M24] way too much. For the past three years, I must have asked out some ten girls for dates. They range from women who I've been good friends for some time to acquaintances. Bar one (an acquaintance, curiously), all of them just left me hanging in there with half answers instead of just saying a clear no. It's not that I feel entitled to an answer, I just find it puzzling. They generally like the idea and say stuff like ""yeah, that would be fun!"", but when it's time to actually plan stuff, they'll either drop down the ""excitement"", cancel the plans on the same day or just straight up not answer.

Do they just don't care about me? Do they like the attention? Are they afraid of my reaction, given all the examples we have of men who lash out when things don't go their way? I'm curious to know if any other people have the same frustrating experience as me. A direct 'no' makes me feel much more respected than this.",dating
2239,If you were isolated growing up I think the dating game is just over in general,"I want to preface this by saying that I do think most people have potential in the dating market, for the vast majority of people they’re well-adjusted and have enough qualities that would make them a good partner. All of this is also admittedly anecdotal as it’s based on my own experience as someone in this situation.

With this, as someone who grew up isolated , I don’t think you have a chance in the dating market if you came from a background like this for so many reasons.

The biggest one is social skills and having normalized social situations. It took me years just to be somewhat comfortable in social situation, nevermind being proficient in talking to others or flirting. If you’re isolated you simply don’t get those small experiences of talking to people and being around others that most people get in high school and the like, which understandably sets you back.

There’s also the issue of potential trauma that comes with that background. For many others including myself, you also have to live with CPTSD, PTSD or a myriad of other mental illnesses because fun fact: people don’t do well under isolation for ling periods of time. This in itself I feel is a death sentence as mental health gets painted as such a red flag that you basically just get written off the minute you start talking about it. I hate how I’m penalized for something I had no control over, even when I’m getting help such as medication and therapy. But it isn’t enough, because apparently having a mental illness gives people “the ick” which, tbf they are entitled to that, but at the same time you feel really empty.

I feel like I’m broken and no one will want me. I want love so bad and have for so long but it’s something that you can’t even talk about for fear of sounding entitled.

It’s all a joke, life is so shitty, I just want to fucking die. I didn’t ask for this to happen but I’m fucking here anyways, just fucking kill me",dating
2240,why do people lie & ghost instead of just being honest?!,"so frustrated lately with people lying and then ghosting to avoid the lie instead of just being honest??? 

Last two guys I met irl I was interested in have done this. One I asked if he wanted to go on a date and he enthusiastically, like within 30 seconds replied saying yes I would love that I’ll just check my schedule and tell you when! Then proceeded to never get back to me. Like he could of just not replied but instead went out of his way to be dishonest. More recently started talking to a guy after meeting at a party, it was a more casual thing but we did have sex & hang out. Texts me saying he’s excited to hang out this weekend/wants to keep hooking up then when it gets to the weekend and I ask when he’s free he leaves it on seen and ghosts me? This one is doubly weird because I know for a fact he was talking about me to a mutual friend, why even do that just to ghost a few days later 

I understand these people don’t “owe” me anything per se… but it’s not even the ghosting itself that’s the issue it’s the lead up, like why say you want to do something you don’t? Just say no I am not interested in dating, no I don’t wanna hook up again. Like why even reply to a message about a date just to ghost - literally adding one extra step. Just ghosting is like annoying but whatever - but the lying bothers me. It’s a waste of both our times and it’s weird?? I feel this specifically happens with men i approach first too 

I also hate it because I have anxiety and my therapist always told me I need to trust what people say is true and stop letting my anxiety run wild with alternate theories but having my anxious alternate theories confirmed and validated repeatedly is making me feel I can’t trust anyone and I’m starting to be more anxious then ever when approaching dating :((

2241,Selfies and men,"How often does the average male send the Gal he is talking to a selfie? Just of his face, not dic pics.

But idk if I'm doing it right or wrong. Like i really really like him and i give my 110% efforts to let him know that i do care for him. But I wanna know will he lose interest in me later on if i do too much but again how much is too much ? Can anybody please tell me if I'm going the right way or not and if i need to give him less attention or whatever. And also he likes me but he describes himself like love ain't his thing anymore but i really want him.",dating
2243,Is it wrong for a woman 25+ to wait to date and focus on her career?,"I’m 26 and I would like to work and study the upcoming 3 years. This means I will study/work 60 hours a week. I would like to date in this period and meet someone, but I have never had a relationship in my life. This makes me really sad and anxious. I think I focus on my education/career as an escape. Is it a good idea to study further or is working alone and more time to date more important in my situation? Any advice?",dating
2244,I (29F) have never so much as kissed another person,"As the title says, I am a 29-year-old woman who has never kissed anyone, had sex, or been in a relationship. Not even an elementary school kind of thing. I otherwise think I'm a pretty well-adjusted, successful human being. I have plenty of wonderful friends, a great family, an awesome job that I'm pretty good at (resident doctor), and plenty of hobbies/skills. I don't really have characteristics that society judges harshly (e.g. medical problems, marginalized identity) or that could intrinsically cause people to struggle with building relationships (trauma, mental illness). I'm not particularly good-looking but not like offensive to the eyes or anything.

I've been on dates with two people before. One was a good friend who was perfect for me on paper but I didn't feel physically attracted to, and the other was a friend of a friend who I initially liked but had some definite baggage from previous relationships that hindered things (and who also told me they just weren't attracted to me).

I feel like my personal life has just been indifference. I can count on two hands the number of people who have expressed interest in me in my life. The vast majority of people just do not give a second thought to me. I was never asked to any school dances, rarely invited to parties, the last one of my friends that the annoying drunk guy at the bar asks to dance with him. I feel like I just don't have the capability to inspire other people to have feelings for me. Definitely have historically tried to take on a passive role (deeply ingrained gender roles etc.) but even when I have been more proactive, I drive them mild.

One of the worst things about it is friends/acquaintances thinking I'm being secretive. They'll be chatting about a past relationship or laughing about bad dates they've been on and the conversation will naturally come to a lull where I would normally share my own experiences, but I have nothing to say and have to try to move the conversation forward some other way. I know it makes me seem withholding or even judgmental, but the alternative is to just tell them. In my experience, that has either sucked all the air out of the room as they try to be overly polite and act like they don't think it's weird as hell, or they still think I'm being secretive and I'm just trolling them. Neither situation has been fun.

I'm also bisexual (in theory I guess) and that comes with some annoyances too. My gay friends think I'm just a closeted lesbian and my straight friends also probably think I'm a closeted lesbian. One of the people I dated was a woman who asked me if my parents know I date women and I very awkwardly told her something to the effect of ""they don't know I date anyone,"" which again, is true, but it makes me sound like I'm hiding my sexuality from them rather than that there is literally nothing to tell them. She must have thought that either my parents are horrendous homophobes or I, at almost 30, am too cowardly to tell them. Or, she did understand my meaning and was doing the overly polite path. This all on top of me generally feeling like a fraud for even considering myself bisexual.

I have pretty much avoided using dating apps because I feel gross judging strangers based on what little information you get from profiles and grosser trying to pitch myself to others. I've asked my friends to set me up before, but aside from the person I mentioned before, they either don't know anyone they think I would be good with or they do know someone but they live 2,000 miles away from me or they're 15 years older than me, etc. My friends have made me get on the apps now, but there's only so much I can stomach of grossly incompatible dudes who are clearly matching indiscriminately. I also hate that how easy it could be to squander my precious little free time as a resident talking to a stranger who turns out to be a scumbag rather than spending it with my loved ones.

I really just feel like I've missed the boat. Like I never had the formative experiences or gained the skills to actually be able to enter a relationship. And that sucks, because I think I could be a pretty kick-ass partner if I could just get to that point.",dating
2245,Are there any guys here who are super fit good physique but still struggle with women?,"Im not sure why, despite looking my best theres definitely still some short comings especially in the dating department. It feels like firstly the muscles didnt do much ofc my confidence has gone up but im still treated the same. Ive been lifting for a year or so and Im not sure why I still haven't had much luck dating wise",dating
2246,Are you really too busy to text?,"I’ve been seeing this girl for a couple of weeks, and we immediately hit it off. I’ve never clicked with anyone like this before and we share this connection that even with my most serious past relationship I never had. 

After our amazing first date (Friday), she said she wanted to go out again. We went out Saturday, and again SHE said she wanted to see me. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we went out to the movies. When I drove her back to her place, we talked in my car for about an hour before I finally made a move and kissed her. We started making out and it was incredibly passionate. She invited me upstairs where we made love. Not fucked, made love. The foreplay leading up was incredible, we were teasing and caressing each other. When we finally started having sex, it was magical. I can’t think of any better word to describe it. It was passionate and intense and we locked eyes and maintained eye contact several times. When we finished, we held each other for hours. Touching every inch of each others bodies and holding each other and kissing. She was telling me what she liked about me and her favorite features, and whispering the sweetest things to me. I left in the morning and came back later that night. It was the same thing all over again, we stayed up for hours having sex and talking. The next day we went on a 4hr 5mile hike, stopped at a diner on the way home, and again we had sex and talked and held each other until the sun came up. I had to go to work but she begged me to stay. 

I left a hoodie at her house and she’s sent me pictures this week of her wearing it, telling me she sleeps in it, tells me she misses me. She mentioned going to  upstate NY next weekend and when I sent her a couple of Airbnb listings, SHE went ahead and booked one for us! Which I wanted to pay her back but we agreed to just take another trip that I’ll pay for!

We video chatted before yesterday for hours and she said she misses me and can’t wait to see me this weekend. She tells me she’s crazy about me and feels like we’ve known each other forever. I’ve never felt this strongly about anyone I’ve known for only a couple of weeks! But she’s so sophisticated and beautiful and kindhearted. And she says all the rights things to make me feel great about myself. She even said she wants to be exclusive and doesn’t see the need for Bumble anymore.

But for whatever strange reason, she can be a pretty awful tester. We texted yesterday for a little bit in the morning and then I didn’t hear back from her till 10PM (12hrs later). She sent me a bunch of messages and photos of what she was doing but I was already asleep. 

I responded to her this morning and didn’t hear back from her till 130PM after I had double texted her asking if she was okay. She just said “hey sorry yes I’m okay! I’ll text you later”.

She works full time in the city and I know she’s studying for a certification, but is it possible that someone is THIS busy that they can’t find 5 seconds to just say “hey I’m busy today, I’ll text you tonight”? I don’t want to bring this up to her cause I am NOT gonna start nagging her not even two weeks into a relationship. This makes me feel as though she does not prioritize me or doesn’t respect me enough to give me the time of day. But at the same time, I feel as though maybe I’m over reacting because everything else is literally amazing and going great. 

Should I be worried or is she really this busy?",dating
2247,Is it safe to assume that someone who love bombs you and moves extremely fast is at best playing you?,"I (37F) have recently stopped talking to 43M bc his behavior smelled fishy to me.

From the beginning, 3h long phone conversations once/twice a day, big words prior to first meeting (day dreaming about our life together, I have talked about you to my parents, I would like to visit your home country with you and travel together, if you lived with me etc) showering me with compliments...it felt pretty fake to me.

During the first meeting he was extremely smooth, showered me with compliments all the time, he even gifted me a pair of silver earrings, which again, didn't feel genuine.

we kissed during the first meeting and he invited me to his place, I said no. he said he respected it but insisted 40 other times. I kept saying no.

We met another time and he was pretty lukewarm, phone calls diminished greatly, and his pace of answering messages was way longer, many times he even refused my calls and didn't call back nor sent a mess to explain what's up. the second time he tried to have sex again and I said no. (I explained to him prior that i need to feel comfortable with someone in order to have sex).

This weekend, after canceling a date and not rescheduling, and disappearing for almost a whole day, I called it quits.

I explained to him that I don't like inconsistent behavior and his interest seems superficial (he has never been really interested in knowing me, more interested of talking about himself).

He said that I am too guarded and that I have never said i miss him or proposed a date and that I never invited him to my place (?!?!?). we met just twice!!

Does it seem the behavior of a player or am I really too guarded?",dating
2248,What is dating like for a female with HPV?,"I was lied to by my now ex about being clean, and today got diagnosed with genital warts. I’m crushed. 

I looked up online that it takes years for this virus to go away.

I was lonely and made a wrong decision even though the red flags were there. I feel like shit.",dating
2249,How to get over someone you barely knew,"It’s going to be about four months since he ended things. We were consistently going out over a month, but went on dates over the course of 2 months. I found out he’s seeing someone now and I am happy for him because he’s a good guy. However, I’m struggling to get over him - someone I still barely knew. I know he wasn’t my person and I know he doesn’t care to have me in his life, so why is it so hard for me to go? It’s gotten easier, but I still think about him right when I wake up and when I’m about to sleep. Any advice on how to move on? 

He truly didn’t give me any red flags or icks. We just simply weren’t meant to be. It’s hard when I can’t find bad things to pick and I’m not angry or anything. I just want to be ok again. I just feel like I should be further along my healing journey since it’s been months, but I find myself stuck.


Added: I think what makes it hard to heal is also just feeling like I could have done more during our time together. When I was with him in person, I was really present. However, the time when we were apart, I wasn’t the best. I didn’t know how to be. This was my first time truly dating a person and I feel like I self sabotaged myself. I didn’t want to seem too clingy, so I seemed distant and “hard to get.” It’s hard when I knew I could be better for him, and now I don’t have the chance.",dating
2250,Annoying Things guys have done on a first date.,"I had one guy lay on my stomach and I have a very sensitive stomach and I asked him to get off me. And I was pretty annoyed I asked him to leave. 

I had another guy ask to massage me feet. I cannot have someone I barely know touch my feet. I asked him to leave. 

I had another guy wanted to pick me up for the date and i inisted on meeting at the location. He asked why and i said ive watched date line and started freaking out and we didnt even meet.

I also have had several men ask me for a massage on within our first couple of dates. Sorry but isnt that relationship stuff.  

I had one guy ask if he could bring his friend along on the first date and I ended dating him for several years his friend did become an issue later. 

I had one guy who was picking in his ear and like going hard at it.  Though he was really nice and so finished the date but didnt go on another. 

I had another guy i went on a couple of dates with and  every date we went on he brought up his best friend who is a girl. And i was an artist and he said he doesnt like art but only hers. So super ouch. No more dates 

Am I out of line by not liking these first date antics like are my boundaries too much. Why cant i just find a normal nice guy 😒

2251,Nervous about dating apps,"I (30f) am divorced and want to start dating. But the thing is, I never really dated before. I met my ex as a teen at church, he was my first/only boyfriend, we mostly hung out at his parents house, we had 3 chaperoned dates, like 2 or 3 actual dates, and then we got married. (Yes, mistakes were made, we were kids) 

So now I'm kinda ready to try dating after 18 months of being single, nothing serious, but not hook ups either. Just fun casual dating. I'm so nervous to try dating apps, but I haven't met anyone organically dispite making efforts to be more social (I work in customer service and recently joined a gym). So I guess, what information should/shouldn't I put on my profile? I've read where some women will use a fake name (but be honest that it's not their real name) for safety until they feel comfortable with someone. I have kids, but I'm definitely not shopping for a stepparent for them and I want to keep them safe so I don't know the etiquette of dating as a single mom. Ugh. I'm just nervous to do this but it feels like normal jitters, not ""this is a bad idea"" jitters. 

Any advice would be great.",dating
2252,Am i a bad person?,"So here’s this guy I met online. It was around 3 months ago. We’re in different countries so i’ve never met him in person basically.We were still in the dating phase and are seeing where it goes.
So he’s constantly trying to bring sexual stuffs in conversations and always wants to video call and ask me to do sexual stuffs too. I wasn’t really into such stuff but I really like him however I was looking for a serious relationship and want a loyal partner who spoils me and we do cute things together and he says he wants the same thing which maybe true idk really.
So, I confronted him today about how he only pays attention to me when its about sex. And he said I hurt him alot with my words , didn’t trust him at all and i accused him of using me, and basically made me feel really guilty about it.
So am I the bad guy here?",dating
2253,To the ladies - you can advance things too ya know,"So I've been OLD for a few years now, had a good few things but nothing sustainable long term. Over these years I still have not learned WHEN to advance things because y'all are all different. Some don't want to chat at all, some want a couple of days, some want x number of messages, some want to be pen pals for a week. 

I have even asked on occasion but it's not a good springboard into conversation, especially when the attention span these days is virtually zero. 

This isn't to all women but in my experience I'm the one advancing things like 90% of the time. 

Suggestion: rather than waiting for the guy to do everything, if you are feeling good and comfortable with someone, send them your number or hell even ask to meet up. So many times things have fizzled because I took to long to ask or been ghosted because I ask too soon. Look, we can't read your minds and it's rarely communicated what your expectations are, so please do us a favor and pull your weight in terms of advancing things. It's a two way street.",dating

The reason for my lack of experience is that I’ve always struggled to meet people irl, as well as the fact that I’ve had insecurities that prevented me from putting myself out there on apps.

It's been four years since my last relationship and I've finally have my eyes on a cute guy I see most days when I walk to work. It took me six weeks to finally grow some balls and talk to him and in that six weeks, I painted a picture of him - someone who's got a job, decent and has his shits together. 

So we started chatting on messenger and on the second day, he dropped the bomb. He's not looking for a relationship and he also told me some very personal and intimate stuff and all I really see is 🚩🚩🚩. I really appreciate his honesty and frankness. I am, however, extremely disappointed because he's not the guy I  thought he would be. I know he's not the problem, it's me! I think I'm delusional for having a crush on a stranger I know nothing about. I even thought as far as to where we could go on our first date! 🤦‍♀️

Most part of my life, career or competition wise, if I have my eyes set on something, I WANT it and I WILL get it. But this short encounter just reminded me that you can't always get what you want. And that's just life. 

They say, people come into your life either teach you a lesson or change your life. And in this case, it's the former. If you see a cute guy and you're interested in him, for the sake of love, just do something about it stat. Do not procrastinate.

2262,Feel Shut Out From Dating,"I (26M) feel like women are never attracted to me, straight up. No eye contact, no flirty smiles. Don’t insult me by implying I’m socially inept or unable to read people, I can tell when women are or are not interested in me.

I’ve had one real relationship in my life and that was like 8 years ago. I used to be more attractive (receding hairline) and it is VERY obvious that I get way less attention now. Even though I am much more fit, have a degree and a job I love and am proud of. 

It seems like women in my preferred age range (21-30) simply don’t want balding men or men with my head shape. This has caused insecurity, depression and awkwardness which contributes to the problem. But, again, the initial attraction is very rarely there ANYWAY, regardless of those problems. I am not willing to settle for someone I’m not attracted to just for the sake of entering a relationship, but unfortunately only fat girls ever seem interested, straight up. Fitness and health are important to me and being overweight is a personality red flag to me.

But 7 hours before the date, she said she couldn't make it (she didn't Cleary said what it was) so I replied ""That it was fine"" and she replied a few hours later,  ""sorry!  But it was something unexpected""

So I've left her on read for now. And am not sure if I should propose or ask another time or just wait for her to reschedule something/reach out. Because she showed a lot of interest before hand",dating
2268,Genuinely Curious as to what incentive everyday men have in dating?,"Referring to online and the mechanism of swiping on profiles; presenting pictures of oneself. Beauty is subjective, so the 'everyday' man is folks who aren't Brad Pitt, and could be labeled ugly or unattractive, whether they truly are ugly or just middling. I'll preface this with saying I met the loml through an app called Wizz (yes I know it's technically not a dating app, and yes I am rather young lol). Sadly, she left me. All-in-all, you'd have to possess a degradation kink. You genuinely are subjecting yourself to bullying. Its sad because I have balls of steel, but I've seen it be done to others as well and they do not take it so lightly. Besides the name-calling and other things of the likes, you can just see by the numbers released by platforms, men open these apps to nothing, if not the responses to their pleas for attention with scalding rejections. Why, exactly, do they continue to do this? I just don't understand even partaking in the matter.",dating
2269,I went on the worst date with someone I thought I knew,"I matched with an old coworker on tinder. When I worked with him, he seemed nice. He’s recently divorced, but he was respectful to me when he was still married. I agreed to get a drink and catch up, I thought it would be fun. 

Since I knew him prior I gave him my address rather than taking a Lyft. This is why I’m so torn on just blocking and moving on, he knows where I live and worse, he doesn’t live very far away. Terrible mistake, will not make again. 

He picks me up and I see him trying to open the door for me. I get some people like to do this kind of thing, but I find it corny and annoying. My last bf would constantly complain if I opened my own door. Like I’m 30 years old. I can open my own ducking door. But that was fine. I could ignore that. We’re chatting in the car and he goes on a completely unrelated tangent and brings up his daughter, a teenager, having a boy over and he slapped her saying “my ex says it’s abuse but she had a boy in my house.” I went “your ex is right, that is abuse. Would you have reacted that way if she had slept with a girl or your sons had slept with someone?” And awkwardly try to laugh it off. This is the exact point I’m regretting riding with him and wondering how I can get an out. 

We get downtown and he pushes me to the inside of the side walk. Again. Another thing dudes do that I just find weird. But with the added context, it’s just a lot of sexism. At the bar he insists on paying and I’m all for it at this point. He jokingly says the n word and I go “dude no that’s not ok, don’t aay that.” And he goes “well my black friends let me”. He goes on a rant about a black woman we used to work with who is now his manager. Says she’s incompetent and that she slept her way into the position. Even says she tried to sleep with him. I know this woman. She was the epitome of class. He goes on about how he yelled at her one day and should have been fired but he’s a top performer so they didn’t(we used to work in sales). 

A guy near us asks if we’re together kind of looking confused. I go “no.” And he responds “I wish.” 

He gossiped really nasty things about all of our old coworkers, some I shut down with a “I’m friends with this person still, I don’t care to hear this.” Joked about tying me up. Hit his vape inside the classy bar(I get it at dive bars, but there are levels). Asked if I thought the guys sitting next to us were gay. Told me he fantasized about me when we worked together(when he was married). He bought molly for rip off prices. I could have told him too, but I didn’t. When he went to the atm the people offered to sell me some and I told them I knew they were scamming him and they were just lucky that I found this to be a bit of karma. 

I got home safe and unharmed but he left his dabs on my porch and had an excuse to text me to get them. It was a good $100 worth so I figure I need to give them back as quickly as possible so he doesn’t show up unannounced and he comes over with his teenage children in the car to pick it up and tries to start a convo about going on another date. I told him my kid came home early and unexpected(true) so I wouldn’t be able to go anywhere for a while since school is out and I don’t leave her alone at night. 

I just. I can’t believe how bad this date was. He was nice to me, sure, but his stories were dripping in sexism. I would normally block and move on, this is why you don’t tell people where you live before a true conversation.",dating
2270,Dating advice for people not interested in using dating apps,"I keep seeing many posts asking where to meet people without dating apps. I’ve always used this and it has always worked for me so I thought I’d make a post .

First off you need to date with intent. Which means you need to be very clear on exactly what you are after and the kind of person you are after.

This is important as you will end finding what/who you are after a lot faster than just the standard going to clubs or bars .

Grab a pen and write down what kind of person you are attracted to , what are their hobbies , habits , occupation etc .

For example if you are a girl , you might be attracted to outgoing men who love , fashion , coffee , maybe they enjoy hiking and building stuff or repairing things around the house .

For guys , maybe you like introverted girls , who’s a home body , likes reading , cooking and is maybe a school teacher and plays an instrument and collects antics .

The above examples are quite detailed but this level of detail is needed to paint an accurate picture . Once you have this level of details . Start thinking of all the places this person would go to and go to these places .

For the example of the guy : you can go to areas with trendy coffee shops , google where they make the best coffee in your city . Browse men fashion stores which matches the style of the person you want . Join hiking groups , go to stores for building and repair supplies. Go to manufacturing expo or conventions .

For the girl in the example I gave . Go to antic stores and flea markets, go to live music bars or concerts in your area . Volunteer at your local schools or churches . Join cooking classes or book clubs , this can even be online clubs and classes . I’ve seen chef doing zoom cooking classes where they give you a list of ingredients and wine to pair and you all do the classes via zoom .

My point is if you follow this , it’s a lot easier and more efficient thank just going to a bar and it’s very much tailored to the kind of person you are attracted to .

Hope this helps 😊",dating
2271,Do men truly just want sex only? Do I (29f) need to have sex quickly to really find a proper partner; is this the norm?,"Apologies in advanced for the long context, and if you read it, thank you so much. TLDR at bottom.

I (29f) matched with this guy (29m) on bumble a few weeks ago.

Conversation was decent and normal, we met up last week at a chill bar. We got along really well. He told me he doesn’t want a hookup, that he likes sex but wants someone who’s a partner and can talk to. He lived two mins away from the bar, so drove him home since he ubered. We were in my car just talking, and we started making out. Then before I even know it, his dICK IS OUT??? Im like… ya know, kind of intoxicated (NOT DRUNK) and truly not even processing. But I started touching him when he moved my hand to him. And he’s touching my chest. And then we move to the back seat and I keep touching him and then he starts fingering me. He starts to take my top off and then I tell him stop and I can’t do anymore because I need more time and this is out of character for me and I don’t want this, I’ve just been drinking and not thinking properly, and it’s probably time for him to go.

We were still texting after that and he was being affectionate and sweet and showing adamant interest. He even went and got a STD testing done the day after the date because I told him I wouldn’t sleep with him until he’s at least tested.

I told him that just because he got tested doesn’t mean we’ll be having sex, and again that hookup on the first date was so out of character for me and I need to know the guy better before I do stuff and if he wants out he can, and he said he understands and doesn’t want to back out and wants to see where this leads and let it happen organically. 

A few days later, we’re texting and then he sends me an unsolicited dick pic. It put me off immediately. But he left his hoodie in my car and I felt bad not giving back to him, and felt maybe I’m just being too uptight? It’s 2023, maybe I’m just overreacting about his behavior. So when he asks to met up for dinner this past Wednesday, I decide to give one more chance and to at least give his hoodie back. And he said he would tell me his STD results then too, and I wanted to find out since we did a little hookup the week before 🙄

We went to dinner. It was fine. Chill. Glad it was dinner so we wouldn’t have to do anything else and I could just leave when done. After, we were walking back to my car bc the parking lot was a few blocks away. Of course he started talking about sex.

I asked would he be willing to wait a few months for sex. He said no. I was like ??? 
He said setting a time point is like a punishment for a child, like saying “time out for 5 minutes” and it’s degrading. He said it’s self sabotaging. I said I need time to get comfortable and know it would take a few months. He said he understands waiting until I’m comfortable, but that I can’t put a time limit on it. I said it may not be three months, it could be two months or four months or more. It just depends and that I know myself and would need to wait awhile to form an emotional connection before sex and that takes time. He says we have a connection as we get on well. I said, just because we get on well doesn’t mean we have an in depth connection. I know myself and it’ll be a couple months at least. He said he can’t wait that long. I said let’s call it quits then. He said no, let’s see where this goes (???) and that all girls say they want to wait but they never actually do.
We went back and forth a bit about that and me saying I’m not like “other girls”, I genuinely need to wait, those are my morals, my boundaries. It was just repetitive on me stating that, and him saying he can’t wait months, but will wait until I’m comfortable a wanted to try. 

Back at my car, I drove him home. He doesn’t have a car since he just moved from the Netherlands and Ubered to the parking lot. So I just drive him home. When we parked, he started kissing me. He tried to touch me. I would tell him no. He tried to touch me down below again, I said no. Then he said why don’t I touch him? I said no. He said please. I said no. Then he took his dick out anyway. I said put it away. He left it out, still trying, I kept saying no. Eventually he put it away. And he was sweet then bc then he was just kissing my cheek, my nose, would even brush his fingers against my cheek as we talked more. Then he tried to touch me again wtf. I said no.

An annoying part was after I said he should go, he placed a hand on my thigh again and he said “oh are you wet?” Which fuck no. I was just sweating lmao. It was hot and we were in the car and my legs were pressed together, chafing ya know, I’m sweating. I said that and he was like I don’t know, and then took his hoodie and tried to wipe it on me so he could get my “smell.”  I was jokingly like get out of here! And it’s just sweat! But inside it annoyed me. He left, told me to text him when I get home. 

We’ve been texting still, though I started to pull back and today I texted him saying I appreciate everything he’s done for me, he’s sweet and a great guy, but sexually I don’t think we’re compatible. He said,“Yeah, I agree with what you said. I was losing a lot of attraction for you and I already moved on tbh.. Not having sex for so long is just not for me. I doubt you'll find someone who will wait but I hope it does happen somehow. Take care!”

My question is, what is with guys wanting sex so quickly ??? I like sex just as much as the next person but I just need some time to get to know someone, jeez. I just want to know someone better so it doesn’t feel like they’re just using me to masturbate, and so I can actually enjoy myself too. If he wanted just a fling/hookup, there are other people out there who just want that too?? I even gave him outs saying to call it quits and he still said no??? Like what was the deal??? Why are people like this?? Are there guys who really won’t wait?? Is there truth to what he said about me not finding someone who will wait?

TLDR; I (29f) matched with this guy (29m) on bumble a few weeks ago. He’s been very forward and ready to fuck since first meeting. I have not, telling him I need to time to get to know someone. I told him very nicely today we should part ways because sexually we’re not compatible. He said “I doubt you'll find someone who will wait but I hope it does happen somehow.” Why are guys all about sex ?? Are there really guys who won’t wait?

EDIT: some of y’all are RUTHLESS I didn’t say I wanted to wait a century for sex, I just want a little time to form a connection before damn 😭",dating
2272,Does a man’s relationship with his mom really matter?,"I’m not even sure how to best ask this. I (27f) have been casually dating a man (27m) I’ve known since we were in high school. We reconnected recently and it’s been so much fun. However, I’ve known for years that he no longer has a relationship with his mother. She waited until he’d graduated from high school and from marine boot camp, and then left his father, making him feel like she had abandoned him too. 

That happened in 2016. He has barely spoken to or seen her since, but has a great relationship with his dad. 

I hear and get told all the time that a man’s relationship with his mom is indicative of how he’ll treat you, and I’ve had multiple women in my life tell me that it’s worrisome to them that he wants nothing to do with his mom. However, he’s been nothing short of amazing to me—opens doors for me, always calls when he says he will, kind, supportive, everything I could want. 

So I guess I’m just curious as to whether or not this is an actual red flag? 

PS I know that his mom left his dad because their relationship was incredibly toxic—I was around when it all happened + I’d been around them in the capacity of being friends with their sons.",dating
2273,Feeling unseen and stupid,"Never been the type of girl guys liked, a tad bit too tomboyish, a little too tall, a little to awkward, a little too annoying , a little too loud, and a little too depressed sometimes. 

You know when u congure up stories in your head abt someone and your on a whirlwind of potential romance? Like sometimes you even dream abt it. And then one day it all clicks in your head that they never even noticed or cared really, ur just another person they know.

Feeling stupid but honestly felt that way my entire life. I feel like people can see through my act, that in reality I'm a clown and unworthy of love under everything.

I just wish for once, someone would want me first, im tired of grasping at straws trying find out how to be liked by someone just to realize i can never be their type. I'm nobodies type and never will be. Just wondering how and if anyone can recover from this.

2274,Question about my own porn use.,"30 year old male here.

I find porn distasteful because I feel that it distorts my view of  relationships and people in general.  I believe sexual desire is something that should be saved for a relationship with someone.  Also, from personal experience, I feel happier and more confident, basically more myself, when I have gone a long time without porn.  To get this out of the way, I used to be really religious, but recently left my religion about a year ago (due to reasons unrelated to sex and dating).  In spite of leaving religion, I still have a negative view of porn.

Three years ago, I committed to eradicating my porn habit before seriously dating for a long term relationship. This sounds like a long time, but covid and personal illnesses also screwed up my dating plans.

Nevertheless, I still struggle with porn a lot.  On average, I currently go a little over one month without looking at porn before looking again.  I think I'm not going to be successful at looking at porn much less than that.  

Shame at not being able to be totally porn free is clearly part of what is driving continuing usage.  I feel like choosing not to date until I have made additional improvements in this area is a hinderance.  I feel I could totally date tomorrow if I wanted to, and I've been told by a couple of women I know that I would be a great person to date, I just chose not to because of the moral commitments I made.

I understand that every woman is different and communication on this issue is necessary.  But I have to ask these questions just to get a sense of what is out there.

1)  Is looking at porn once a month a lot?

2)  Does looking at porn once a month (and more generally, what I have stated here) make me undatable?  Should I give dating a try anyway?",dating
2275,"Should I give the lemons from the lemon tree my ex bought me, to him?","My ex 33m and I 32f have been broken up for over a month now. When we were together, he bought me a beautiful lemon tree. Finally the tree has 2 lovely lemons ready to be picked.

We are on okay terms, I see him at the office about 2 x a month, and I actually want to give him the lemons because he loved that tree and used to watch the progress of their growth every time he was here. We would talk about all the ways we'd use the lemons when they were ready.

Would it be weird if I made a nice packaged and gave him the lemons? He did buy me the tree and I do want him to have them, I will keep the rest of the lemons that the tree bears, but since this is first batch, it would make me happy for him to have them and I don't see any harm being caused to him by giving them to him.

I was going to put them in a brown bag, with a little note and discreetly leave them on his desk.

2280,Is sending NSFW to others cheating?,"My girlfriend told me this morning like as soon as I woke up that she had sent explicit pictures to a guy in Cali for two vapes. I haven’t gotten mad at her (not to her face or over text at least) and I haven’t said anything remotely rude other than she needs to stop smoking. I don’t know if it’s considered cheating or not because she didn’t do anything else (that I’m aware of) to or with him. Just the photos. I’m still kinda really hurt about it but I’m not sure if it’s cheating or if I’m just being irrational.

She has apologized numerous times and I feel kinda bad so I forgave her. She keeps saying sorry, in like every text she sends me, and I say it’s okay every time, but I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up with her, but I need advice on what to do, I’m open to really anything other than breaking up but if that’s the only way this gets fixed then I might.

UPDATE: So I took advice from a lot of different people. We are currently on a break, and we set boundaries for whenever we get back together. The boundaries are basically what we both define as cheating and if either of us cheat we will break up (whenever we get back together). There isn’t a  specific time we will get back together but we’re both currently working on ourselves. Thank you to everyone who gave advice and it really helped open my eyes to see how bad it could get and how bad it might have been. We talked it over and other than that, she’s never cheated in the past which is good I think. Again thank you to everyone who commented :]",dating
2281,Feeling bad rejecting after first date,"I went on a first date today. It’s been a while so I was a bit rusty but overall it went alright. He was a really nice guy, also attractive, but we are not on the same path in life right now so I knew I wouldn’t be continuing to see him after this. 

Sending him the rejection message after was so hard. I feel horrible. Rejecting a man who didn’t really do anything wrong, just not quite compatible, is a lot harder than I thought it would be. But I didn’t want to waste my time or his. 

Idk why I’m saying all this. I guess just trying to process still. Has anyone else found it it difficult/ felt bad about sending a rejection message after a first date? I know I’ll get over it and get that tough skin back but I just didn’t realize how difficult it would be getting back in the game.",dating
2282,ADHD with Dating,"For years, I have always struggled getting through that very early phase of dating. Not because I expect every single date I go on to lead to a relationship (necessarily) but because when I meet someone I like enough, I always seem to want to talk to them constantly, usually unintentionally coming on too strong or something. Like I talk and if they don't respond fast enough, I assume its because I have come on too strong and that I messed it up and its a cycle of self loathing. 

I always thought I was incapable of taking things slow and would always end up hurting my own feelings. But apparently its a part of dating with ADHD that no one ever told me about. 

For years I always hated that I simply couldn't relax and just go with the motions, that I don't even need to be truly dating them for them to be all I think about, even super early on, but now I understand the endless back and forth of dopamine and self hatred that plagues my early days of courtship, but now that I know that its a part of dating when you have ADHD, I am relieved and also annoyed, wish someone had told me sooner.",dating

I’m only really attracted to men who I know deep down won’t love me, I like very masculine men who aren’t short of women.

I quite literally hate myself, and dislike basically everything about me.

During the day, I kinda repress this and do my best not to think about it or let it affect me, and others look at me as a rather positive and uplifting person. I'm successful in my profession, and tend to be assertive in business contexts. Nobody would ever guess I hate myself.

But there are days when self-hatred gets the best of me, especially when it comes to what women I like would think of me.

And I know that confidence is important and that women tend to be turned off by the lack thereof.

2297,Girl said she would only meet up as friends,"Last year I went on 4 amazing dates with this girl, but she broke things off. She had recently come out of a 5 year relationship and wasn't ready for anything more. I was depressed for a while and decided to move on with my life. After 5 months I booked a solo holiday to Morocco, and to my surprise I crossed paths with her there. We started talking again, and have been talking for 2 months. It finally got to the point where I couldn't just keep talking anymore, so I asked her out, and she said she would only meet up if it was as friends.

2301,I (27m) had an awkward hookup with a girl (28f). Wondering how I could have been handled better.,"

This girl and I had been on 4 dates and everything was going well. We really enjoyed each others company and she told me she felt happy and relaxed around me, and I felt the same about her. 

At the end of our 4th date we start to hookup for the first time (we had only had brief kisses the previous two dates). A few minutes into the kissing she starts to critique my kissing. She does it by asking “do you know how to French kiss?”. Now I’m not saying I’m the world’s best or most experienced kisser but my kissing style hadn’t been an issue with past partners. 

I’m of course open to constructive criticism and learning what my partner prefers, but I felt like the way she delivered the line was a bit insensitive and it threw me off my game and I got in my head. I did ask her how she preferred it and she responded a little frustrated and said “I can’t teach you how to do it”. She eventually gave me the advice to “not move your lips and just move your tongue”. I had never really done it that way before but I tried it that way and apparently that wasn’t what she was looking for either. I tried to diffuse the situation by saying we would work on it and figure out what worked for us. She responded saying “no, you’ll work on it”. She tried to say it softly but the comment didn’t make me feel great because I felt like I was genuinely trying to understand how she preferred it and I felt like I just got back a lot of blame and frustration from her when a more gentler approach would have been better.  

We eventually decided not to use much tongue when we kissed and she said she enjoyed that better. But later when she was touching me through my underwear I wasn’t getting aroused because I was still rattled by the earlier exchange. I told her that I was still in my head over the kissing critique and we decided to stop. I went home and the next day she texted me saying she felt connected to me emotionally but didn’t think we were compatible physically. She was nice enough in the breakup text but I am still really bothered by her tone and her general attitude during the criticism.  I took all the blame for the situation in my response and told her I had some anxieties I was trying to work through. 

I didn’t tell her how the delivery of the critique bothered me but I wish I would have so that we could have talked it through. She was always very sweet to me before this so it was very surprising that her tone wasn’t gentler. I know it wasn’t her intent to hurt my feelings but I do wish I had let her know how it made me feel.  I initially wanted to ask for a second chance to see if we could establish the physical connection but now I’m wondering if her handling of the situation was a red flag or if I am just being too sensitive.

Was there a better way for her to handle giving me the critique? Was there anything I should have done differently? 

It’s been about a month since we last spoke but the interaction still bothers me and is making me feel like I should have stood up for myself and been open about the fact that I was uncomfortable.",dating
2302,Found someone. Really happy for once. What I’ve realized,"I’m a pretty introverted dude. I wouldn’t say a total loner but typically, I prefer my own company. Dating had always been hard because I overthink quite a bit and was introverted. I finally met someone about 6 months ago and we’ve been dating for 4. I’ve realized that the people you are meant to be with will develop naturally and if you find yourself overthinking a lot, it’s probably not meant to be. I haven’t overthought anything with this. We just seem to get each other. Yes, it’s still relatively new but just wanted to say for all the people struggling, find your own happiness first. I was really happy with being a single dude when we met. I was and still am going to the gym a lot, producing music, working full time and just enjoyed life. I realized that when I came across like I was looking for someone, people picked up on it and was the opposite of a magnet. Just find what allows you to enjoy life and be yourself. You’d be surprised what happens when you stop focusing on finding someone. It sounds cliche, but sometimes a cliche is a cliche for a reason. I realize I had spent so much time wallowing in loneliness and it’s embarrassing in retrospect. But we all live and learn. We all make mistakes but we have to learn from them. So to anyone struggling out there, find what you love to do and focus on that, not finding someone. Your person will come along when you least expect it. Just be open to opportunities and not narrow minded and everything will work out.",dating

I could be described as somewhat open or promiscuous by some but I think I just tend to lose interest quickly, which might be more telling of the people I have dated and not myself.   I tend to like things a little more “creative” in the bedroom and have had a lot of trouble explaining or even “warning “ people of this as the dating process begins.   My life does not revolve around sex, but it’s a part, if not a main part, of a good relationship.  I’ve met some nice guys who are very bland and some very wild guys who are either horrible partners or want nothing of substance.  Has anyone been in my shoes?

2308,Lost all motivation and enthusiasm for dating and meeting people. Let alone sex,"As the title reads, I've lost my motivation to try to connect with anyone. After my previous gf broke up with me in January, I went through my grieving phase. A month or two ago I started to try put my feelers out there. I'm on tinder, bumble, and hinge and my profile looks decent. I've been making efforts to work on myself too, I've picked up new hobbies and training bjj  and kickboxing. 
Initially I was putting a lot of effort into conversations, trying to be creative and interesting. I've had a couple people that I've liked and who I thought liked me. Managed to setup a few dates and move off of dating apps. But when the dates approach I get ghosted. This has happened about 6 times in the past 2 months, I managed to go for coffee with one person who I liked, and they said they wanted to go get dinner next week at the end of the date, but the same thing happened, when the second date approaches I get ghosted again. At this point I'm struggling to find any joy or enthusiasm to connect with anyone. Sex is completely out of the question, I can barely meet anyone in person. 
My question is, how do I shake myself out of this rut? I know that the apps are terrible for confidence but I work very unsociable hours as a fine-dining cook so going out to bars on the weekends isn't an option. Any advice is appreciated",dating

- eye contact when someone is talking to you. 
- 2 way thethered conversations
- manners- saying please and thank you
- putting your phone away for a couple hours.
- listening and engaging,

Y'all, I was shattered after our breakup. For too long. I cut contact and deleted him from all social media because I didn't want to know if he was dating anyone else. Now, one of the first things he tells me is that he was in such a serious relationship that they moved in together? And she got him into therapy after I begged him to go for almost 2 years? 

So while I was depressed and lonely, he was happy in a relationship. Awesome.

And usually it's to save them from some past trauma they had that they did not solve or to stroke there severely damaged ego that they did not take the time and effort to work on themselves. It feels very based on conditions and rules and it seems to be coming from a lack of accountability and not wanting to do the inner work. If that's love I don't want it.

We’ve met in person one time in the last week, and honestly it went well. It was a nice date. 

We were texting last night, and out of nowhere he goes, “Oh, you live in the same apartment complex as a friend of mine did. I wonder if you’re even in the same unit.” 

I responded with, “What? How did you know that? You’ve never been to my place.” And he said, “I have ways. Don’t worry, it’s behind a paywall and not everyone can access it. You’re safe with me, but I can’t say the same about everyone else.” 

Safe to say I’ve been pretty creeped out ever since and don’t know what to do or how to tell this guy I don’t want to see him anymore. He became very hostile towards his ex when we discussed previous relationships (saying she’s an “effing lowlife” but that he “would still want to be friends” even though she “is a disgusting human being”), and I’m pretty sure he has a short fuse. He was cheated on repeatedly, and I’m pretty sure he has trust/control issues due to that, and even sent me a photo of my work building (which he can see from his, we both work downtown) with a “Are you in this one?” caption.

I feel like a 2/10 but my friends say I’m good looking, maybe because I grew up as the fat kid, because I’m 6’2 260 and mostly muscle.

2318,Did he (24) get distant because I (22) refused sex?,"This happened a long time ago, but I need somebody to make sense of this situation to me. 

I met the guy on a dating app, he reached out to me, was quite flirty, and initiated a date at his place. I asked to meet in a public place instead, and he suggested a bar which was close to where he lives. We met, it went well, we had really a lot in common so I liked him. After the date he walked me to his place, even though I had told him earlier that I didn’t want to go to his place. I made an excuse and left, but the following day he asked me for my IG and said he was deleting tinder. 

A month goes by (we were both away as it was Christmas break), he doesn’t message me at all after the date but watches my stories and likes some of them. Eventually we’re both back in town but he doesn’t initiate a meeting, so I do it. He postpones it a few times because he’s busy, but ultimately we plan something and he suggests getting some food and going to my place. I reluctantly agree, since I know what that implies. Date goes great, he’s very respectful, we have a lot in common, he seems like he likes me, we talk about my past, his past, him wanting kids in the future etc. Then we go to my place, he suggests watching a movie in bed which we do. He attempts to initiate sex a few times, which I refused (I didn’t feel ready). He takes it well, is kind, but leaves earlier in the morning than he said he would and looks visibly disappointed. 

After that, a week goes by and I don’t hear anything from him. No plans of another date, nothing. He continues watching my stories but doesn’t heart them. Eventually I reach out (again) and say that I felt like our last date ended quite awkwardly and ask if he’s down to meet again. He says he is, but when I ask him when he’s free, he says he’ll let me know. I knew he told me earlier that he was busy with work and college, but several days pass by and he still doesn’t let me know about his availability and stops watching my IG stories. I reach out yet again (unfortunately) and say I’m free the following weekend if he wants to come (at this point I had already caught feelings for him and felt quite desperate), he suggests I come to his place. We set a date (that would be 3 WEEKS since our second date) and I ask him to send me his address then later, he just hearts the message.

Would you guys say, at this point that he was only looking for something casual/a hook up, especially judging by how distant and reluctant he got after our second date? I found that really confusing because it felt like we were so similar and had so much in common, and that he genuinely liked me. Also, I don’t have much dating experience so it’s hard for me to tell.",dating
2319,Waiting for someone to text me back literally shifts my entire personality mood and attitude for the day. Help.,"So. I've been texting back and forth with someone for the past two months. We both have jobs and are very busy but we make the effort to text at least once a day. I dated a lot in college but there was a good period of time (about four years) where I didn't date at all and so going through this process is a bit jarring and is bringing out some ugly traits that I didn't know I had. 

I've never been that much of a good texter - my friends know that I might sometimes take at least three business days to reply, really terrible, I know and I've been trying to actively work on it. Even when it came to dating through apps, I struggled to maintain a conversation and it never really reached past a week's duration. However, when I really like someone, I'm a very prompt and engaged texter. 

This guy that I've been texting isn't the type of person to ask a lot of questions so initially, I thought that he wasn't really that interested. However, he always makes sure to text me at least once a day, even if it's late at night and sometimes we talk several times a day. The issue really isn't his behaviour  - it's more how *I* feel in response to it.

To clarify, we met on Tinder and have yet to actually meet up yet because he's currently going through exams - which yes, I know contributes to the reason why he doesn't answer super promptly - and we intend to actually go on a date after he finishes. 

I know it's irrational, I know there's no real reason to feel the way I do but when he takes a full day to reply, it leaves me feeling gross and down and grumpy. I feel as if he's suddenly not interested. This, of course, changes as soon as he replies. 

This is clarifying to me that I have some type of insecure attachment pattern that I previously wasn't aware of and I need a lot of validation. I've always been confidently comfortable in my own skin and very independent, so this is quite a jarring realisation. 

How can I stop feeling like this? I've tried to keep busy and have constant things to look forward to. I've even tried dating elsewhere. I still am obsessing about getting a reply and checking my phone constantly throughout the day. I know this is a bit of an age-old part of the ritual of dating so if any of you have experienced this, how did you deal with it?",dating
2320,Finding positive mindset as a single in your 30ties - how do you do it?,"Hey reddit community - I am a female in mid 30ties, happy, active and have a good life that I once believed I would share with someone who is equal to me, but I feel with every year passing this is more of a distant fantasy rather than a reality. So I am after some advice from some of you who have gone through something similar, and have accepted that maybe you will just stay single by choice, and not have your partner-in-crime and 2.4 kids - and how to do it without 'faking' happiness.

For reference I am 32(F), consider myself quite attractive and take good care of myself, I run my own successful business, and live in a small rural town (which can be problematic when everyone under the age of 40 is already married). I haven't been in a relationship for about 5 years, and have 'completed' dating apps numerous times, and to be honest I can't say I've seen too many people on there that would take my fancy - I'm more of a cheeky/witty bio & prompts girl, which most guys simply invest no time in.

When I ended my last relationship, first I was like, yay, freedom, and in the last 5 years I have built my own successful business, started numerous hobbies (gym, running, surfing, skateboarding, hiking), have a great group of friends surrounding me, love the place where I live (even though it's remote) and generally am really happy with my day-to-day life. But there are also days when I physically have pain in my heart as I feel that I have so much love to give to someone, and share a truly epic adventurous life with this person and it really saddens me that I have 'failed' to find them.

I have attempted dating from time to time via Hinge, but unfortunately nothing has stuck. I feel the modern dating world is like dating on speed - there's certain goal posts to be met by date 1, 2 and 3 and 5, otherwise you are just wasting someones time. For me attraction takes a long time to develop and I need time to get to know people's quirks, and how they view the world and treat others to see if I can actually fancy them in a romantic sense. In the past (pre-dating apps) I only dated people who were my friends first for months or years, which  would be quite difficult given that most of my male friends are already married! Nowadays, when I do date, I think I always attract guys who are a fair bit insecure in themselves (be it their looks, or their career), clingy and generally are looking for constant reassurance from my side, which for me is a huge turn-off. I am independent and confident in who I am as a person both personally and professionally, so I struggle to connect to guys who are clingy by date 2-3 and expect a lifelong commitment. I have spoken to a couple of my friends whether I should just settle for one of these guys, as they are all perfectly acceptable in many ways, but I feel it'd be so unfair to do so on both of us (I sure would hate to be on the other side of this equation), so I normally just cut these relationships off before I feel the other person starts to develop feelings that I simply can't reciprocate. I was stuck in a relationship like this for 6 months, where I kept thinking, he's a nice/funny/smart guy, the feelings will surely come, but 6 months later I still didn't feel that connection with him, and breaking it off made me feel so horrible, like I was just stringing him along even though we had multiple conversations about how it takes me ancient turtle time to fall for someone, but it still sucked when the feelings just didn't come.

Anyways, I haven't really dated at all for a year, (turns out the same guys are still on the apps even years later), and am slowly slipping into the state of, hey, the problem is me not them, and maybe this is just the way it's meant to be. I am not the sort of person who fusses over being single in my day-to-day life, I have a very busy and adventurous life, but there's those moments of sadness that come up, especially when going to parties and events where everyone is coupled up, and I really struggle to get over the sadness and loneliness when I get home. Are there any happy & single folk out there in their 30ties who have managed to get over this feeling, and have come to acceptance with the fact that they simply might stay single, but this is an active choice? I need some advice how to turn my mindset from I am failing at my basic human task to find a mate to a positive one of I am free, happy and thriving in my solo adventure. Are there any books/audiobooks/podcasts anyone can recommend?",dating
2321,Not physically attracted to the guy I’m talking to,"So i recently went on the first date with this guy i have been talking to for 2 weeks but i dont feel attracted to him in person. 

We matched on bumble and i really felt a magical connection with him. On the first day we matched he suggested calling and we ended up talking over the phone for 6 hours. And subsequently we would call for 3-5 hours almost every night. On the nights when we wouldn’t call i missed him, almost. And i felt like we were really compatible and had great chemistry and communication too. 

Obviously i found him good looking on the app which is why i swiped right. But fast forward to the first date, and things just didn’t hit the same. I wouldn’t say he’s ugly but he’s def not someone i would go for. I can’t see myself kissing him at all and I’m not sure if i will be physically attracted to him over time. But i am very emotionally attracted to him as of right now. 

I know in my heart the right thing to do is to let him go, because he’s a great guy and it’s not fair for him to accept anything less than someone who’s 100% into him. And i can’t give him that. 

So i need help. Can someone please tell me how i should let him know that I’m not physically attracted to him. But in a gentle way and in a way that’s the least hurtful as possible. Or any advice as to how i should stop letting him on? 

I feel really bad because on our date i got a present for him since his birthday is coming up. And at the end of the date i decided to give it to him anyways since i got it for him in the first place. But he seems to really really love the gift and he keeps telling me how much he appreciates it. So i fear he’s like really attached to me now. HELP!",dating
2322,Is burnout from dating a thing?,"I (29f) have been on many dates, like MANY. I've only had 1 serious bf, was horrible, and 2 that just didn't work out, but we are still friends.

I'm so tired of dating that I don't seem to find many people attractive anymore, I'm exhausted of the effort I put in that isn't reciprocated.

*I don't want marriage and kids tomorrow, I'm just looking for a future with someone, meaning serious dating.

Tried a little around the age of 18, but I really started learning how do date, flirt, etc. at the age of 24. Starting that late is like playing on a hard mode from the start: adults are much less forgiving in this area than teenagers.

Whenever I go a few months without being intimate, I begin to crave intimacy more and more. It manifests in experiencing strong mood dips, when I suddenly start feeling depressed, randomly wanting to cry, a feeling of pointlessness. Their frequency increases until the need for intimacy is satisfied, when they go away.

Underneath, there's a cocktail of needs: wanting to feel desired, romantically and sexually accepted. It's a deep want to be intimate at all levels, that no friendship can provide.

The first few months are manageable, but from some point on, the only thing that helps is intimacy: kissing, romantic cuddling, petting, sex, etc.
Non-romantically, non-sexually embracing a close friend only helps for a day or two. Masturbation no longer does anything. 

Cognitively, I know it takes time and that I'm on my way. Emotionally, it's _why the fuck it takes so fucking long_. It's like a hunger: it grows and becomes less and less bearable.

**TL;DR**: How can I manage this craving for the time necessary to find and form a relationship?",dating

Some people complain about this and that in dating. In most cases, dating and relationship are not magic in life that simply helps me to be happy ever after. I choose to date and look for LTR because I am not type of person who can choose to be alone for life. I am still very happy single, just not want that for life. So as I date I know the person would not just add values to my life, they would bring challenges to work on too...

So I only try to look for a person having similar core values as mine, and willing to communicate to make it work. It is already too hard, feel like hitting a jackpot to find one...

And I see some people being so extreme, demanding, stingy, lazy yet want nothing but just added values from dating... So tired",dating

2331,I (26M) got my heartbroken for the first time,"EDIT: thank you all for the kind words and support. Hopefully I'll learn my lesson next time.. and hopefully I'll finally find someone that I can match with 

Some background about myself -

I have only one ex, which happened 10 years ago, so I don't really got any experience in the field.

Also, I'm struggling to get into the dating scene cause of anxiety and other bs.

In the past 2 years I only went out with 2 women, which didn't work out, and I didn't care bout it when it ended.

&#x200B;

About 2 months ago, I started texting this girl, it was just friendly at first, but very quickly I caught feelings for her (even though we only texted and phone called once).

We were texting non-stop, and after a while I suggested we meet up, to which she gladly agreed.

Once again, even though it was only mostly texting, I never felt such a connection with someone, and it felt like she was feeling the same way, as she showed interest in me and initiated conversations.

Last night we finally went on a date, and I feel like the texting vibe translated very well to real life, and the date was really nice.

This morning I could already tell something was off by the way she texted me, and a few hours ago she said it's not gonna work out romantically between us, but she'd love to stay friends.

This is the first time I cried in about 5 years, and the first time in my life I feel heartbroken. It was so amazing and I have no idea what made her feel that way, to just give up after one date.. Not even giving it some time.

How do I deal with this? My mind keeps going back to last night trying to figure out what I did wrong. I'm fighting myself not to text her again and see if there's a chance (yeah I know it's hella stupid and there isn't one).

2342,Guy (27m) I (28f) am dating called himself my boyfriend and got quiet when I tried to verify what he just said.,"I’ve been dating this guy for the past three months. We decided early on we’d take things slow and except from my usual anxiety when dating someone new, everything was going great. We had some hick-ups when it comes to communication, but are able to address issues and talk through them in a mature way. He stays very calm even when I get emotional, and I appreciate that a lot. 
He is however very introverted and won’t address things as quickly as I would. 
Since he hadn’t been single for long before we started dating, I basically let him show me what he’s comfortable with. A few weeks ago he told his brother and sister about me, which was enough for me at that point to think he is taking this seriously. I think this might be important context. 

Anyway, I have this neighbor that has a few times tried to get me to go out with him for drinks and even left a note on my door asking me to go and have coffee with him. One time he knocked at my door at 9:30 pm and handed me a cake. He probably hoped I’d invite him in, which I didn’t do. We do not have any friendship and only say hello to each other in the hallway. Also: he has a girlfriend. 
I have always refused his invitations while trying to be nice because I don’t want to live in a building where I have to feel weird about my neighbors. I have told the guy I’m dating about my neighbor before. 

A few days ago I was on a date with aforementioned guy (let’s call him Tom) and we were walking around my neighborhood when I spotted my neighbor. I told Tom that was the neighbor I told him about and I grabbed his hand to make sure my neighbor noticed. We talked about it for a bit when Tom suddenly said: “I’m sure he knows you have a boyfriend now” 

I was taken a little aback by how casually he mentioned it, but obviously also happy. Our conversation had been fun and breezy up until that moment so I reacted by chuckling and asking him: “is that so? Do I have a boyfriend?” I was smiling the whole time and still holding his hand. 
He laughed and said: “that did come out rather smooth”.
Although a cute enough answer, I wasn’t sure if he had misspoken or not. 
So when he was silent after that I kinda nudged him with my elbow and said: “you can’t just stay silent now” (still laughing and definitely not making a big deal out of it). 
He did however stay quiet. We had reached our destination so the conversation moved on to other subjects but he never revisited it and now I’m confused. I don’t want to push him, but at the same time I feel weird now. Calling himself my boyfriend without any influence from external factors makes it seem as if that’s how he has been feeling about me, but I can of course not be sure. Maybe he surprised himself by saying it and didn’t want to get in to it. Maybe he was planning on saying it on a more appropriate place and time? I have no idea. 

Before he blurted it out, I wasn’t really thinking about it. I have of course thought about it, but it wasn’t something I was waiting for or I’d want to push at this moment because I wanted him to be comfortable and everything between us was going great. 
Now however, I keep replaying that moment and wondering if he feels as if he made a mistake by labeling himself as my boyfriend. Long story short: it has made me insecure. 
I thought about talking to him about it but I also don’t want to make a big deal out of it and don’t want him to feel pressured. I think I handled it as well as I could in the moment, but my anxiety has been triggered for a bit.

Because of this invite I assumed things were moving in a more exclusive direction. So a few days ago we’re hanging out and I casually mention something about how I deleted my dating apps and I liked him (duh). He said hadn’t done the same, but he’s not seeing anyone else either. We talked more about relationships and I thought all was well. Anyway after that he goes silent for almost a week. And finally text me how he just wants to be friends.

2346,"Crush , not sure what to do.","Tl,dr: I like a guy I volunteer with, I asked him to grab coffee to chat volunteer stuff, we didn’t hang out bc he got covid. Should I ask again?

Me: 36 F
Him: 35 M

I’m on the board of a nonprofit, I have a crush on another member of the board. Late last year I suggested we have coffee to discuss some things about the board, he accepted, we scheduled and then he got Covid right before we were supposed to meet up. I told him to let me know when we should reschedule. I didn’t hear from him & we never rescheduled. After that I figured he wasn’t interested and forced myself to get over it. We were still super friendly and always texted w a couple other board members during the meetings and outside of them to discuss random things. 

A couple months after the failed coffee, I invited him and the other seven board members to my birthday party. He was the only one that came, and he only left because the friend he brought with him wanted to go home. The first time his friend asked to leave he ignored him because we were chatting. that night was pretty busy and I didn’t get to spend much time with him one on one. Shortly after that layoffs and other drama started at my job and mostly consumed me until recently. 

Fast forward 4 months. 

We recently had a board happy hour and the two of us spent quite a bit of time talking by ourselves in a corner and discovered that our childhoods were strikingly similar in some interesting ways. My crush is trying to resurface and I’m wondering if I should try to let him know I am interested again. This guy is attractive, educated, kind, considerate, shares some interests and still manages to be endearingly dorky in an way that I can’t really articulate — the kind of person who wears ASICS running shoes from Costco but still manages to look fairly good doing it. I haven’t heard anything about him that gives red flags. 

If you were me, would you ignore this latest interaction and write it off as a friendly 30 minute chat? Or would you try to find some way to suggest a one off meet up? If you suggest I try again how should I do this? I’m pretty rejection sensitive but I know so many women who found their partners by taking a small leap of faith and telling him or a mutual friend they had a crash or flat out, asking the guy out. Going back in for a coffee chat seems a little dubious because I attempted that and was taken up on it but there was no urgency to reschedule on his end. I also don’t like the idea of chasing a guy (not sure this qualifies but feels that way).

2348,Miss having someone,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 3.5 years before he dumped me to marry someone else. Going deep into that is like opening a can of worms so won't. In this rant, I just want to talk about the positives and what I miss.

I miss the feeling of companionship. When there's a strong friendship, it makes the relationship so much stronger and comforting as well. I turned to my ex for career advice, advice with family and friends, and a lot of other things. Having that level of intimacy where you have the freedom to say anything and everything without having the fear of being judged but just being listened to.

Even though the breakup was painful, at times, I have missed turning to him for advice and just venting to him. I have often asked myself in such situations - what would he say about this or what would he do? 

I am introverted and he is an extrovert yet in social situations, we would always agree upon when to leave a gathering. I miss looking across the room to find him and just convey through facial expressions - can we go home now?

When we lived together, I used to love cooking for him. I used to look forward to cooking something new or trying something new. Sometimes I would cook something different only to surprise him. I can now count the number of times I have cooked since we broke up. Doesn't feel the same and in general, I just lack the enthusiasm. I think I miss the look of surprise on his face and just the whole point of sharing a meal with someone you love.

I have tried dating and never really found that spark where someone would be more interested in the real me and not based on how I look. Feels nice to be complimented for looks but that is not everything for me. 

Sometimes having someone in life is such a blessing - we don't realize we are taking them for granted until they are gone.",dating
2349,Just a vent about a party I (38M) attended that turned into an introspection about how I perceive myself,"This post is just for venting and it's very loosely related to this sub.   
There won't be a TLDR because this post doesn't call for any comment, it's just a small contribution about a personal experience.

I went to a party yesterday, met with friends and made new friends. Around 4 AM most people were long gone but the 6 remaining of us (4 M, 2 F) then went to someone else's place to hang out. I was tired so I initially thought I'd go for a few minutes but ended up staying for over 5 hours.   
We were initially all a bit tipsy and my group of friends started taking ecstasy. I never tried but drugs are not really my thing so I didn't take any. We didn't consume alcohol during that ""after party"".   
We talked for hours about pretty much anything and everything. We eventually talked about what we thought about each others, the positive and the negative.   
I come from a small and rather isolated island with a population of less than 300k, it's a mainly conservative place, I moved to Canada over 12 years ago. I came to realize I have never had this kind of conversations with anyone before, either with friends in my home country or in my new country of residence.

What these people told me tore me apart, in a good way. I'm crying just writing these words.   
Some of them I've known for years, some for a few months, some I just met that night. The take aways are I'm a great guy, I lighten any place or group of people I come in contact with, I'm smart, interesting, funny, I have deep and meaningful conversations. One of them told me he wishes to become more like me. On the downsides, which I'm already more than aware of, I'm shy, I'm too modest, I need to open up faster (I do open up but it usually takes time for me to know the people and feel safe with them before I do). One of the 2 women present at that time told the other, her best friend, that it's me she should be dating. I find it flattering that the same woman, whom by her own account dislikes most men and can hardly engage in conversations with most of them told me she liked and even wants to take me on a ""date"" (my own word, she wants to have a drink with me someday). Note that she's a lesbian and currently in a relationship so it'll be nothing more than a friendly ""date"".

By their own account, the drugs they took were very light and they barely had a feel-good mood. The ones I've known for a long time did not display an altered behavior so I tend to believe this. For the people I knew from before, some of the things they told me, they already told me while sober so the drugs clearly did not alter their minds too much.

The things they told me affected me tremendously because I've felt like a human piece of crap, unworthy of romantic love for most of my life. I'm a 38 years old virgin (that, only 2 of my closest friends back home know about, and now you do as well) and I've been dealing with below 0 self-esteem and confidence all my life. I gave up any hopes of meeting someone a long time ago and haven't even tried looking for someome since then.   
I'm now working on this with the help of a therapist as well as working on my body and losing weight. -35 lbs in a couple months, I'm quite happy. I'm not calling for comments about weight loss, I know this is hardly sustainable in the long run and I'm taking precautions to protect my health, I'm simply starting from a very high weight and the initial loss is naturally much faster than for someone starting from a lower weight.   
My therapist tries to help me accept my body as it is (while still working on improving it of course) but that's something I simply cannot do. Years of suffering due to obesity have deeply ingrained a feeling of hate and disgust about my own body. I feel it will take more time to accept my body with her hello than losing my extra weight and getting to a body I'll be comfortable in.

I still have a hard time processing and accepting what they told me.   
A recent rejection, or at least I took it as a rejection, from a woman who initially pursued me and for whom I still have a high interest, makes it even harder for me to accept their compliments. How can they see these things in me when I can't and women seemingly don't either, or at least, the ones I have a romantic interest for?   
I still don't know what to do and think about this recent ""rejection"" (I have another comment describing what happened in more details but after pursuing me and initiating a date and physical contact, she slowly broke off contact with me and told me she wasn't ready for a relationship after I told her what I felt for her: an interest in knowing her more, and that I wanted to see her again). I know I should just accept it and let it go but as the first woman ever to show that much interest for me, I have a very hard time doing just that.   
I'm certainly very immature in many ways, especially when it comes to human interactions and dating/romance. I'm working on that. That after party is typically the kind of thing I would have never went to before and I had to force myself to do so, I'm happy and proud I did.

So, I'm still a work in progress, I need to learn to love myself without first putting a condition on my looks and weight.

moving forward, everything was going well. exactly how anyone would want it to go. he says the great things and he makes plans and he wants to continue making more. but that’s all by what he says. if we go by our mutual friends…they have something different to say. they say that i need to step back and be careful. they say that he doesn’t want anything serious…so a relationship. they say he’s not as into me as he acts. 
it just doesn’t sit well with me. it really doesn’t. i keep thinking of reasons why that might not be true. like, maybe he just hasn’t opened up to those friends about him having feelings for me. or maybe he’s simply just afraid to admit that he does have feelings for someone. 
it just doesn’t seem right. he even said he wanted to take a day trip to the beach with me. that doesn’t seem like something someone would do if they didn’t want a relationship? i’m just lost here. i don’t want to have to start putting my guard back up. bc when i do that, i go cold. i can’t be casual about it.",dating

Growing up, I've been on a few first and second dates, though nothing came about from any of them, and last year I had my first long-term, committed relationship with a fellow wheelchair user. However, due to both of us having unpacked emotional baggage that collectively made the relationship less than healthy, I choose to end it after 8 months.

All of that being said, outside of that relationship, whenever I've (on the rare occassion) casually dated, or have had someone interested in me or have been interested in someone, I find that such a potential relationship really is just a pipe dream for me. Usually the interest starts things off on the right foot, but then the reality quickly sets in: can't go to their favorite places for dates because of a lack of accessibility, more nights in than they would like because the wheelchair needs repairs or recharged, traveling and outdoor activities become much harder to engage in or enjoy due to wheelchair concerns, etc. I am just so tired of seeing the interest drain out of a prospective partner's eyes because they realize they can't live the life they want with me.

For others, the task of convincing them that they will be a partner and not just some kinky au pair for another manchild with a different-than-normal excuse for needing to be mothered or taken care of becomes so great that I might as well not even try.

Lastly, because my parents growing up weren't very good parents (neglectful, suffocating, controlling, and sometimes downright abusive), I didn't really grow up normally. That is to say, I didn't ever really grow up with a sense that I was lovable or with the appropriate opportunities to develop normal social skills. Consequently, I am terrified of being vulnerable in close relationships. Up until recently, I didn't really know what I liked and disliked and what my needs are because, well, for the vast majority of my life, I wasn't allowed to be my own person. All of this is to say, I am just as crippled psychologically as I am physically. I do go to therapy and do what I can to better myself.

TL;DR: I want to be a part of a romantic relationship, but what I truly have to offer pales in comparison to anybody else (at least to me). I know dating is hard, but why does it have to be this hard",dating
2356,"When approaching someone, men and woman have different ideals","So I was just thinking, a guy wants to approach a woman when she’s not surrounded by all her friends right? Less risk of getting socially ganged up on or embarrassing the woman in front of her friends.

What about women though? Many don’t want to be approached when they’re alone and if they are they can become intimidated. So when do Woman want to be approached?",dating
2357,My emotional needs are not being met,"Tired of my LDR

I’m tired and this ldr that I have right now kind of exhausting and draining me. I like the guy so much and I feel like he’s the only one I got in life… but lately I did everything I could to understand him. I feel like I’m always the one begging for his time and attention that I feel pity for myself when it shouldn’t be like this.. relationships should be like this at all.

Now, I don’t wanna break up with him cus again I feel like he’s the only one who understands me. But I’m seriously tired begging and asking him to call me many times.. my effort is not being reciprocated.

How do I go on with this? I’m scared I’ll be devastated after I break up with him and will be all alone again",dating

2360,How to not be boring? 24M,"Hi all,

As a 24 year old guy, I've recently been struggling with this.

I feel like it's really hard to not be ""boring"" and it seems like most girls I am interested in dating are looking for someone with ""good energy"" or ""rave with me""

While I admit this could be a symptom of me not getting out there enough, I also am fairly introverted and enjoy my alone time.

2363,Would you wait for someone if you knew they weren't ready for a relationship?,"my best friend and I have feelings for each other but i can tell she isn't ready for a relationship.

I agreed to it cuz i had nothing else to say but thinking about it now should i just wait for her to be ready to date? I know she won't be ready to date until the end of this year

Edit: forgot to mention issue is that she still lives with her ex. The lease dont end till end of this year. She does also have feelings for me but can't/don't want to date me while she lives with her ex since it's not fair for me or for her",dating
2364,I am emotionally tapped out,"
I (25m) am at the point of being emotionally tapped out as dating and relationships has never worked for me. 

My first two relationships I was cheated on (I ended both) and my last one (3 years) my ex became emotionally abusive so I ended that as well and took a year off from dating to work on myself and trauma through therapy and self discovery (I had 3 years between second and third relationship where I focused a ton on myself as well).

Since returning to dating, it’s the same trend of I get lead on over about a month that they want a relationship and act super interested then don’t want to commit/don’t know what they want, fwb-zone me, or just ghost. I’m at that happening 5 times now and my dating age range has been 24-28. I also have adhd so I can get hyper fixated when things go well so that’s no fun at all either (although I have learned strategies to manage it much better). I do realize too I get caught into situations that are exciting/stimulating but not healthy bc of my adhd, so I also find myself getting out of those much quicker. 

Just got rejected this week after another month of talking to a girl who after an amazing 7 hour first date lead me on and was indecisive about what she wanted and got super hot/cold, then turned things sexual and lead me on further only to reject me bc she again didn’t know what she wanted. Funny enough, I was taking a 4 month break from dating before this.

Other ones they even introduced me to their friends, did double dates, etc all relationships stuff just to get dropped bc they didn’t “feel it.”

I’m fucking exhausted man. I’m tired of putting myself out there only to get lead on and dropped. I’m tired of being a supportive partner only for me to get shit on. Im tired that it feels like I’m often used for sex only. I’m tired of my friends telling me how amazing I am and how great of a partner I’d be and have been bc even though I greatly appreciate it, it gets my hopes up. I genuinely don’t see it as emotionally worth it anymore and it feels like it isn’t possible for me.

At this point, fwb does seem most appetizing. I don’t need a relationship emotionally to fulfil myself as I feel fulfilled already (I just wanted to build a partnership and a connection). I don’t wanna have to deal with the emotional shit anymore. But fuck I crave the feeling of physical intimacy. I just wanna touch a big butt, have some sex, and cuddle. Also there’s things I wanna explore sexually.

I just don’t know anymore.",dating
2365,Is dating supposed to be fun?,"It usually feels pretty boring and terrible for me. I usually feel bad after a date. Not because anything bad in particular happened, just because it feels like a poor use of my time or something. Idk.

Maybe I just don't get along with most girls? I go on dates that go well but it feels like something is missing? And I don't feel Super excited about a second date. Just feel like I'm going through the motions or something Idk.",dating
2366,Managed to lose the little joy I've found,"Long story short, my friend wanted to set me up with a girl, but it failed. I got ghosted and after some conversations, this friend said the girl seemed kind of grossed out by the very idea of being with me. And judging by the kind of guy she went after before me, it's all too clear why it happened. I don't have facial traits such as a neanderthal forehead or a proheminent jaw.

I was finally getting some peace of mind, and now I got my failures rubbed into my face like this. And the worst part is that it's nothing I could ever fix. Plastic surgery can't safely and reliably give me the decent facial traits I lack. Not that it would matter if it could anyway since I can't afford that, but I digress...

It sucks, it sucks big time. Right when I was managing to feel a little bit happier and more peaceful, I get reminded of this sad fact. I wasn't really going after women before that, so I wasn't getting my unattractiveness rubbed on my face due to the sheer rejection I always face when I try getting anything going at all. Now I can't stop ruminating. Fucking me, being born with a face lacking desirable masculine facial traits. I wish I could just not want any relationships or sex at all and just leave blissfully, peacefully alone. But alas, it's just not possible.",dating
2367,Dating someone who possibly has an avoidant attachment style?,"I [M34] met someone on an app [F35] about 6 weeks ago. From the start, the conversational cadence was like maybe one back-and-forth exchange per day on the app, which continued after she offered her phone number and the convo moved to text. After about two weeks of talking, we met up in person. 

The date went really well, with great conversational flow and mutual interest. By the end of the first date, we had a nice, if tastefully succinct, bit of kissing and she gave me “the look” before quickly pulling away and giving me a flirty send-off. 

After that, the rate of communication/nature of the texting stayed almost exactly unchanged. Then after a second date, and a third, I noticed a pattern: she could take up to an entire day to respond to a message, and then I, not wanting to put all the pressure on her, would also wait half a day or more to respond. The exchanges are always well-thought out, but it’s almost more like we’re composing emails than texting casually. 

When we meet up in person, the dynamic is totally different and more…alive. But we don’t live very close and we’ve both established that we’re looking to find someone to see, ideally, maybe once a week. So at this point I’ve seen her four times. I’m fine taking things slow, but neither physically nor emotionally has it moved past that first date. Every time I see her, it’s like we’re experiencing a *really good* first date—but only a series of first dates with progressively more understanding of each other’s backgrounds and interests. 

After the third date was followed by a period of particularly slow communication and one rescheduling when she said she was sick, I told her I got the sense she might be cooling off, and that that’d be okay if it were the case, I just wanted to make sure whether she actually still wanted to see me. She apologized for giving me that impression, said she was still looking forward to going out, had just had a lot of stressful things going on she hadn’t felt like sharing yet. And when we did go out again, it was a great time, and she was verbal and clearly having fun and it was lovely. But again, at the end of the night, I got a few moments of rather chaste kissing and the distinct impression she was “pulling herself away” with her good-night.   

I’ve never experienced this before, as I have a history of being pursued by women with (I hate to use a buzzword, but it’s applicable) an anxious attachment style. I am very secure and tend to meet people where they’re at. After reading about avoidant attachment style, and knowing some stuff about her childhood, it makes sense to me that that might just describe her relationship to connections with other people to a tee. That is to say, fiercely independent and very guarded, and although she may like my company, she is pulling herself away from me to protect herself, wary of abandonment/rejection from an outside party. 

The thing is, as I say, I have a pattern of dating rather clingy, anxious attachment people. 

So I don’t know if maybe this is just *typical* for six weeks+four encounters?

Basically I’m curious to hear from anyone reading this how often they find people who (or if they themselves) respond to texts on such a slow basis, who are so slow to open up or show more tenderness/vulnerability, etc…Again, I’m totally fine taking it slow, and I don’t take the slow communication personally. I’m still in the dating pool, seeing other people, but I feel like we have the *potential* to be highly compatible, and she’s smart, sassy, and extremely cute; I just feel like I’m having a hard time reading her, and I’m just curious to sort of survey the crowd for others’ experiences with this sort of thing.",dating
2368,Dating someone who has kids?,"I’m a 26M who’s been dating a woman same age who has a little girl of 3 y/o.

Recently just met her daughter and spent time together going on days out etc and i’m just absolutely amazed how well we’ve took to each other, she really is the sweetest little girl you could ever imagine!A while ago I could’ve never pictured myself in this situation, I didn’t like to be around kids or an interest in dating someone with them, but I feel i’ve become more open minded to it all. I really like the partner i’m ‘dating’ (not quite official yet) but we are pretty deep now, and the opportunity to be this little girl’s superhero is just something so wholesome that my previous experiences of going out all the time & chasing women just doesn’t compare to. Many people i’ve spoke to just would not entertain the idea of being involved with someone else’s kids. This is all new to me so I just wanted anyone to share experiences they may have of that role of “mommy’s/daddy’s new friend” and how it’s developed over time.",dating

2371,I cry at night because I had sex,"I [19F] started dating a guy back in autumn 2021 (after I turned 18). Two weeks after we started dating he began asking me for nudes, and asking about my sexual experiences. Then he began lightly pressuring me into sex, to what I agreed, and after dating for a month he took my virginity.
 
Then he started pressuring me (having long and exhausting talks after I said “no”, “you gave up your virginity easily, why wouldn’t you agree to have anal”, showing videos and stuff) into anal, and it went on for 3 months, until I finally gave up and agreed.

I was enjoying sex, it was all fine.

But now, after a year since we broke up, I cry at night and have panic attacks, because I deeply regret agreeing to have sex with a person who used me.

2376,30 m needing advice. Posting again.,"Hey so I went out with a girl I had been dating for a  maybe 2 or 3 weeks. She asked me why I haven't asked her to be my girlfriend yet. I told her we were still getting to know one another. She said that she is who she is and she basically knows me now. Anyway I said okay. We were talking about future plans and I said I was thinking of being a firefighter. She said firefighters are hot. I laughed. She finished by saying the ones that were in shape. (I'm overweight but I'm a power lifter) that made me feel bad a little bit but I just laughed it off. I tried to kiss her 3 times. She pulled away each time. Made me feel like shit. ""Do you like to be asked before you get kissed?"" Is what I asked and she said no. I said I tried to kiss you 3 times and she said she had trouble reading the room. We were walking back to my truck and she said here turn around let's just kiss and it was all teeth. Like she wasn't in to it. She has said things to me that has made me think she is settling for me. I feel confused often. I have brought this up to her but she just says it's because of her traumatic brain injury. She really does have one and had to relearn many things. Anyways.

2379,Am I [F23] too young to settle? Should I give up partying?,"Sorry if this is a strange question. But please, hear me out.

Many of relationships/situationships that I've had for the past few years always have the same thing in common - I seem to be more into the guy than he is into me.

There have been times that I've literally cried myself to sleep after hooking up with certain men. And I still don't even know why I cried. Maybe I just wanted more from them? Maybe I just didn't want to feel used? I really don't even know. 

Most of my friends my age say that it's way too young to settle with one man. But I often wonder if I should be spending my time building up a life with one man, or maybe if I should just continue being a ""party girl"" (for lack of a better word). Either way, there is a trade-off.

And I hate to say this, but the ""nice guys"" that I've encountered often times don't seem all that physically appealing to me. But the guys that I really want tend to have lots of options and see me as more of a ""side chick"". So I'm stuck not knowing what to do with myself. Does anyone have any insight?",dating
2380,My fuckbuddy said she loves me - what do?,"I (28f) have been having cybersex with a girl (34f) for a little over half a year now. We talk almost every day and we're very sexually compatible.
However the other day she said ""I love you"" while we were mid adult-fun-time. She had orgasmed a few times at this point and was close to another so I just assumed she wasn't thinking straight and I just replied by telling her how beautiful she is etc. She said it again in the session but again I just showered her with loving words and moved on.

But then she said it again the day after while we were just chatting and I panicked.

Why would she say that? She knows we don't plan on ever meeting in person (her own rule not mine).

The worst part is I used to struggle not to say it to her sometimes (while we were having sexy time and while we were talking normally). So now I'm even more on edge!

I know she doesn't mean it because she doesn't want to meet irl. She knows I have fun with other people sometimes, and I know she does too. That doesn't sound like an ""I love you"" kind of situation to me...

2382,We made it!!!,"Well, long story short. I (32/M) finally reached the pinnacle of confidence, i work as a residential sanitation worker (garbage collector).

So today i was picking up a stop, i looked back she was at her driveway waiting for the garbage can i just emptied, i really thought that was the chance, so my approach for me was ""respectful"" saying this ""Good morning, with all due respect i think you are amazingly beautiful"" she blushed and with a smile said ""Thank you"" and we had a small chat about how the weather was and work ( took about 4 to 5 mins convo ) so we ended up the convo exchanging numbers. So today i consider this a win... i guess im better off without dating apps🤣. With all this said. My guys, dont lose hope. Do your best at your best and just go for it.

2383,Is someone liking you enough to be vulnerable and express emotions a problem?,"Guy (30M) I (30F) had been seeing for a few weeks said he wanted a serious relationship. We had been doing really well, going out on dates, having fun. Sex wasn't that great, but I could work with it and maybe improve with time.

Anyway, fast-forward to last night, I had a really hard and tiring day, so I was feeling exhausted and emotional, you know? We we're texting on WhatsApp (staple on our country) and I expressed the tiniest amount of emotion because somehow I felt he was mad at me from the way he was texting. He dismissed it, made it about him (""now I'm mad you think I'm mad"") and quickly changed the subject. Of course I got mad about it and expressed it. We said good night. 

This morning was the first one I woke up without a good morning text from him. I just ignored it and when about my day, thinking he just needed some time. A few minutes ago I started talking to him and asked what was wrong and he had the audacity of saying he didn't like my mood swings. When I told him last night was the first ""mood swing"" and how it was justified, he just ended things, saying he didn't need more problems in his life. 

Is someone liking you enough to be vulnerable and express emotions a problem?


Important to mention: I'm good being single and I told him that when we started seeing each other and he asked what I was looking for. 
Actually I have been struggling with liking him because I DON'T want a relationship and all that comes with it.",dating
2384,Safety (as a man),"As a cis-het dude (probably) I hear the word ""confidence"" getting tossed around a lot. Needing to be confident. Needing to *exude* confidence. And with that comes the micromanagement of my smile, my body, whether to hold hands, when to offer a physical embrace, etc. Because that's what we're expected to do: be confident. Make the *other* person feel safe.

I've always rankled at this arms-race of confidence, and now I think I understand why. Being confident helps my potential partner feel safe, but what good does that do when *I* don't feel safe with them?

Looking back, I have hardly ever felt safe or secure with the women I've dated. There's always been an uncomfortable distance. A coldness. Or maybe not coldness, but an air of tension. As if they keep waiting for me to give them something without offering any clues. And I keep trying to perform (often overperform) with humor or forced enthusiasm, resulting in either A) my dates leaving early or B) radio silence after the fact. The end result is a bad date, not specifically because nothing came of it, but because I end up a nervous wreck, which in turn feeds my self-loathing issues. All because I spend 99% of the date in a state of utter panic or despair.

Take my last date. I had been talking to this person online for a while, but when we met up things were different. We hugged, but it didn't feel right. She kept looking at me as if expecting something, but I couldn't figure out what. Any jokes or levity I attempted to inject into the date fell flat, or were answered with what felt like jabs at my expense (really it was at the expense of Capitalism or the art world or whatever, but still). She ended up leaving early, which was honestly for the best, and I felt horrible for days after.

Now let's look at a counterexample. Because yes, sometimes my dates *do* go well. I met a woman at a friend's party, and she had the best sense of humor. Apparently she thought I was cute, because she asked a mutual friend for my contact info. Our first date was great, because everything she did put me at ease. We listened to music in my car, we constantly made dirty jokes while at the zoo, we improvised when a museum we had wanted to visit was packed, and the whole experience made me feel good. You could say ""hey dumbass, the difference is that she actually *liked* you."" But it was more than that. I *could* be confident around her, because she made an effort to make me feel *safe*. We went out a few times after that, and no, a relationship didn't happen. But at least we had fun. At least I think about that experience with fondness rather than anxiety or sorrow.

I guess my point is, I need to stop seeing dating as a confidence game. Because it's not, at least for me. I need someone who makes me feel safe. And I have to wonder how many other dudes (or non cis-het women/non-binary folk) feel the same way, but either live in denial or have become accustomed to not being heard.",dating

2394,Is it okay to ask if someone smokes weed on a first date? What about at a speed dating event?,"I'm back in the dating pool and struggling a little because I'm not into weed, but noticed a *lot* of people are.

My thoughts on it aren't based on inexperience, just preference. I've dated women in the past who took the occasional edible, and I myself have been high a few times when a previous girlfriend wanted me to take a gummy with her.

But I don't like how it makes me feel, I don't enjoy being around people who are high since they don't act like themselves and it makes me uncomfortable, and I hate any kind of smoking (because of the smell and health concerns). 

That said, I have nothing against people who like weed (live and let live), I just can't see myself spending my life with someone who enjoys it. So I don't want to waste my time or someone else's by getting into a relationship before realizing they enjoy getting high sometimes.

So that brings me to my question: is it okay to ask someone on the first date if they smoke weed/take edibles?

And as an addition, because I'm considering doing a speed dating event soon: is it okay to ask someone if they smoke/take edibles at a speed dating event?

Thanks in advance for any replies! :)",dating

2396,"I broke up with a girl after 5 months because I do not think a relationship would work, but I hope I am not just scared to commit.","I (22M) really like this girl (21F) from my studies and we have been dating for quite a while, before I ended it 3 weeks ago. I ended it because in the weeks prior I felt that I could not love her the way I wanted to, the way she deserved. At moments I just felt that 'this was not it'. I broke up mostly because I had such strong feelings of doubts about whether I saw this become a serious relationship. She adores me and I felt so bad for not being able to love her in the way that she would like me to love her. I really really like her and she is the best company I could wish for, but still I am not sure if a relationship would work. 

She is very much in love with me and that makes it hard, as she is very frustrated by the fact that I do really like her and we both love spending time together, and still I ended things for 'vague' reasons. We are both afraid I am throwing this in the trash for no good reason. And I am doubting my decision every waking hour.   
Now we are still talking quite a lot (we are not able to avoid each other in our lives anyways), and we met up Thursday to catch up and we just had food in the park and time flew by. In that moment everything just felt comfortable and at ease for the first time in three weeks. 

I really like her and she would be a wonderful girlfriend. But I know that I was not feeling it like I wanted it to. But maybe I am being too critical of my own feelings; but I think it is reasonable to really want to be in love before I commit?  
My last relationship also ended badly a bit over a year ago, after 3y she cheated and left. I feel like I am over that, but maybe now I just want to be single for a while? Or at least not in a serious relationship? But that feels like such a dumb move when I could be with this amazing girl. Maybe I am looking for too much?
So I am also a bit scared I am afraid of commitment. Or maybe I do not want to be in a serious relationship at this point in time. And maybe she really just is not a right fit for me, but then why do I want to do fun things with her? Do I just miss her company or do I miss being romantically with each other?   

I think I did the right thing with breaking up - as I know I was not fully feeling it, and after 5 months I also felt like I was not into it enough. I can do without. It was just so fun to be together and I now miss that.",dating

2399,I'm a failure romantically,"  
I am a 26 man, who went on some dates, but never really got to the point of having a girlfriend or being involved in a real relationship. Back in high school, I crushed on some girls, but I was pretty lame back. I had a good personality in general, but not really a 'charming' personality or a 'cool' one.  
  
In university, I evolved a little bit. I lived by myself, away from family, I started dressing up better, focusing on looking better. In my first two years, I was super focused on studies and my career in general, so I never once was involved with someone, dated someone, or even laid eyes on someone.  
  
In my 3rd year, I fell for a very attractive girl in my class, for the first time in my life. At first, she was super friendly and talked to me a lot and was getting flirty and physical from time to time. I thought maybe that's her way of trying to socialize and making friends in a new place and I had my guard up because you know, there are girls who do this for an ego boost, seduce the men they feel like seducing, without the intent of a serious relationship. Also at the time, even though I gained some confidence but I didn't believe that such an attractive girl would really date me.  
  
It went like this for a couple of months, and then, my emotions got the better of my brain and logical thinking. I decided to stop 'overthinking' things and ask her out, and see how it goes ( even though we hang out together a lot, but not really in a date ). She said YES. We went and had dinner, it was fun. I thought It was getting somewhere and started fantasizing about a second date.  
  
The day after, her boyfriend came to visit her in the university. Most of the class was shocked because they thought she liked me and we were dating. One really bad day. It was right before the exams and I screwed them because I was not concentrated. It was unforgivable for me for a girl I knew for 2 or 3 months, I risked my academic grades that I worked so hard on maintaining because I fought hard for the university I got.  
  
I decide to stay silent and not not confront her about it and maintain the friendship distance. Slowly we turned into strangers.  
  
This was 5 or 6 years ago. My other experiences were : getting ghosted after a good first date ( we talked non stop, she was asking questions, I was asking questions, no awkward silence... ) and getting canceled on before a few hours..  
  
I moved abroad recently for a job employment. I am proud of what I am doing and achieving. It's just that I noticed that dating nowadays can be so toxic. Women have so many options, especially attractive ones. I used dating apps but never got anywhere. Even if when I walk by a beautiful woman, or see a beautiful girl and I think of approaching her, I back off, because of the failures I experienced whenever I made the effort of approaching or dating a woman I liked. I am an introvert and invested a lot of efforts on this previously, so I won't stay I didn't try hard enough.. but what I say to myself is :  
  
Why do I have to go out of my way, when no girl approached me or showed me hints, and the only one who did, was only seducing me for fun or whatever when she was already involved... ?  
  
The few times I did and landed dates with other girls, I decided to just go for it as I have nothing to lose. But no, I am losing something, I am losing time, effort, patience, energy that I could put in working out or learning a new language or learning more about my work or simply go hang out with my dude friends, or family who love me unconditionally..  
  
I honestly see that women these days, in my entourage at least, are not worth spending all this effort for. I strongly believe that there some hidden gems out there, but finding one is not easy... and I failed. I'd rather work on being successful even more, make my parents proud, work on evolving even more, achieving my dreams. I am still a man, and I can't hide the fact that I wish to be with a woman. that I wish to be loved. But I want to be loved be someone who's worth loving back.. and I feel that thinking like this, I won't really find anyone.",dating

Me and my husband have been together for 5 years. we are ten years apart from each other. I am twenty-seven he is thirty-seven. We went though a point in our relationship where we had sex all the time. Now ever since Covid, he says his dick doesn’t work and has to take a pill. Fine I don’t mind, I’ve always been interested in older men anyways! But now it’s to the point we only do oral and that it. I feel like I am in my prime and he just isn’t interested. I am young and blonde so I personally don’t think it has to do with my looks, and I go above and beyond for him. He now apparently can’t take a “pill” because it raises his BP too high.

2401,First time cold approaching using an unconventional method and I feel great.,"So I’ve always had a fair amount of social and approach anxiety but I have reached the point where I will do anything to free myself from it and become a confident person that isn’t afraid to express themselves.

I know cold approaching is quite a controversial topic on Reddit, however, I believe if it’s done in a respectful manner it’s perfectly fine to do. I knew the main reason I wanted to cold approach was to develop the fearlessness of being able to go up to anyone and speak your mind. I didn’t even care as much about getting any numbers or dates from it. So I decided to just approach women I found attractive today and just compliment them. 

I went to a local college campus where I knew there would be girls my age. At first I was scared shitless and sweating like crazy. After pacing around the campus I told myself that I didn’t come all the way over here for nothing and I had to do at least one approach. I saw an extremely attractive girl sitting on a bench outside and it looked like the perfect opportunity. So I just walked over to her before my mind could overthink it. I said something along the lines of “hey sorry to bother to you but I saw you from a distance and just wanted to give you a compliment because I thought you were absolutely beautiful”. To my surprise I received a very warm smile from the girl and she said “awww thank you so much”. At that point I kinda just ended the interaction by saying “yeah that’s all I really wanted to say but keep being great and enjoy the rest of your day”.

After the approach I felt so great even though I didn’t really get anything in return per say. Just the fact that I could put a smile on her face and genuinely make her feel happy with one sentence was quite an amazing feeling. I was so pumped that I did this to two more girls on campus and received a similar response. At the end of the day I was proud to say that I made 3 people’s days better just by getting out of my comfort zone.

If anything this showed me that people are often much kinder and warmer than we perceive they’ll be in our heads and that we’re all humans that enjoy love and appreciation. Even though I didn’t get to ask for a number or anything I felt amazing because I realized I have an abundance of love I can spread to anyone and I shouldn’t take that for granted. That’s what I believe is the key to the fearless mindset: being able to offer your love and knowledge to others without expecting anything in return. 

I definitely want to repeat this again sometime and hopefully next time extend the conversations and maybe even ask for a number (even if it’s just to make myself more comfortable with rejection). I say all this to encourage you all to step outside your comfort zone a bit because you will always feel amazing after you do. And no matter what remember you always have love that you can spread to others :)",dating

But I was able to introduce myself and talk for a few. The worker had to leave, but when she was leaving she told me how nice it was to meet me and grabbed my arm and rubbed it all the down.

We were always on each other social media and he was checking my content all the time. Lately he started liking my posts and stories. We had a good friendly relation and was wondering is this a sign he moved on completely and now can comfortably like my content or is he trying to contact me again. Our last messages were really friendly so if he wanted to reach out I feel like there is no obstacle and he could do that. Being this the reason I do not see it as a way of him trying to reach out to me so I did not write to him even though he liked several of my posts. Nevertheless I find myself waiting for him to write to me and in that case I do not know what to do. I feel like I still like him but I don’t want to go through the break up phase again.

2411,Dating someone much more successful? Im 35F and he’s a much more successful 45M. I feel super self-conscious about it.,"My last ex made a good deal more than I did too and made me feel bad about it. He was worried I was gold digging and would make a point to evenly split everything. This person has been far more generous with me and was actually thankful one night when I picked up a hefty bill (since he had been doing so up until then).

I just feel very self-conscious and like people in my major city are looking for people on the same level as them. He knows what I do and seems to not care but I worry as it develops into something more serious this is gonna hurt me. Love does not conquer all IMO. I basically thought I was gonna do something amazing in my 20s and early 30s and so I’m working in an office in an entry level position. So it feels like “status” wise I’m a 23-year-old dating a well established highly successful 45-year-old. There was one guy who was older than me and also kinda finding his way in the city and I felt comfortable being with someone in a similar situation as me but ultimately he was not someone I had true interest in.

For what it’s worth he seems to really like me and plans good dates. He’s definitely not just using me, which the other ex was. Maybe this person is more comfortable in his self and doesn’t need someone with the status accoutrement. He may actually — oh god — like me. He expresses his like of me too, which is nice. He says he is excited to see me and not the lame “looking forward” I generally receive. I am dating a few other guys cus we haven’t had the exclusivity talk yet but maybe soon soon soon.

TLDR is I met this really cute and badass girl on hinge for a date last week Friday. During the date she said she blocks guys she doesn't like after the date. She messaged me like 10 min after dropoff and said I had fun thanks again for dinner. So I take that as a great sign.

On Monday, I asked if she wanted to minigolf sometime next week, she said yeah for sure, maybe wednesday? On wednesday, I asked her if she still wanted to go and she said she was too tired. I decided I'll wait for her to message me. (This made sense because plans werent concrete and she works at 6am).

Friday, out of the blue, she asks ''wyd tonight'', I said Ill be free after 8 and ill lyk if it's not too late still like an hour later. She said actually im tired now, how about tomorrow? I said sure! What time, she said ill lyk because ill be tanning and swimming with my friend. She's snapping me doing what she said the next day, But she never let me know, so I hit her up like 7:30 and she said she would but shes going out to dinner. I just said ''Alright'' and cut my losses. Like 3 hours later, 10:30, she texts me ''Im Drunk lol''. I just said ''Nice, have fun lol'' and she said ''thank u'' and I left her on read. 

My take is I stop texting/snapping her completely? Wait to see if she messages me 1 last time, and actually sets a concrete date?

We ended up only ever having our 1st date and couldnt ever make a 2nd, but only because of her. Why would she ask wyd tonight then an hour later be too tired? Why would she skip hanging with me for dinner with her friend then drunk text me a few hours later?

2416,"After many relationships, I’ve learned a few things that people need to hear.","This is a little word of advice for getting to know a partner before commitment ensues. I am a 34M and been in and out of the dating world. These are the few things I’ve learned in my experiences:

1) Always be patient and take your time to learn about someone. It doesn’t happen in 3 months, 6 months or even within a year. Confessing your love for someone 2 months in, love bombing and expressing that you cannot live without them will scare the living hell out of healthy personality types.

2) Expressing your traumas and fears are a part of learning someone. Always be under the understanding that not all people can handle other peoples traumas or personality traits, no matter how “right” or “amazing” the feelings are while being with this person. 

3) In the first 6 months, don’t push to get to know their family, friends, kids or social network. Focus on them, focus on who they are with you, what they bring to the table and how you both can mesh each others needs in a relationship. Before this is solidified, nobody should be meeting anyone’s extended social network. 

4) Learn how to communicate. Everyone communicates different and lots of people have different personality traits, which include, anxious, secure and avoidant attachment styles. In order for any relationship to succeed, both parties need to make sure they are comfortable with the way they are able to communicate their feelings, frustrations, issues and ideas to the person they want to be with. 

5) Do not try to change yourself or another person to fit the relationship status quo. They may be gorgeous, intimate, attractive, but changing your likes and personality to suit someone else’s needs or wants will end up in disaster. Be yourself, let them fall in love with who you are not who they want you to be. 

6) Do not use sex as a distraction from the issues that stem from a relationship. Sex can be amazing, you may feel this person is so attracted to you and can make you feel amazing. But, the second arguments or disagreements are put under the rug and sex is the main priority, it will blow up later on. Trust me. 

7) Most people are aware of what manipulation and toxicity is. Do not be offended if someone removes themselves from your life if you are portraying toxic behaviors or emotionally abusive tactics. 

8) Most breakups hurt the most because people fall into this cloud of “love” that because you love this person they would do nothing to hurt you even if they have expressed their issues with the relationship. The only way that gets fixed if you deal with the issue at hand. If one partners issues keep going undiscussed or stone walled, expect the other person to pull back due to the lack of respect when bringing up important things. 

9) Nobody is responsible for your happiness but you! If you are recognizing unhealthy behaviors when starting relationships, step back, get some therapy and love yourself before you love someone else. You will thank me. 

10) Do not stay in any relationship no matter how amazing if you feel unsafe or walking on constant eggshells no matter the reason. Life is to short to waste. 

Edit:

11) When one partner deicdes to call it quits, give each other the respect and time to heal. Even if you don't think you should be apart, time = clarity. DO NOT contact their friends, their family, or anyone on your partners side regarding your emotions or to get info on your ex. Its toxic, if you ever have a chance to get back together, this will truly destory it. 

12) Understanding why the relationship broke down is important. It helps you understand who you are, what changes to make moving forward and being grateful that you had the chance to learn from all this. DO NOT beat yourself up, FORGIVE yourself for it, because you are 1 in 8 billion in terms of humans in this world. You’re leaning, just like everyone else. 8 billion other people are also going through the same roller coaster ride and learning who they are. Be kind to yourself, be patient, there is no perfect way of doing any of this. Relationships are meant to break down, its how we get back up that makes us who we are. Love yourself. 

Hope this helps! Please add in any other points to help people out in this group.",dating
2417,Did he just want sex,"I met this guy recently on hinge and we talked for about 2 days before going on a hiking date. The date was alright nothing spectacular. During the date he kissed my cheek, held my hand, and picked me a cluster of small flowers (just some contex). I notice that he isn’t too talkative over text as he is in person. I also noticed that when we text he doesn’t really ask questions to get to know me, it feels like I’m the one asking questions and carrying the conversation on my back. He has a kind of boring personality to be honest lol. The day after the date he asked if I wanted to do something after he gets off work, I agreed and asked what he had in mind. He then asks me what I wanted to do so I suggested that we take a walk on the beach or go to the mall. He then suggests to come over to my place (which really isn’t my place it’s my roommates and I told him this earlier when we were texting) and watch some Netflix and get some door dash, which sounds like “Netflix and chill” to me. I then again suggested some fun places we could go to that was in a public setting. He messages me back and says “I just realized I have a virtual doctors appointment at 5 lol” so I ended up leaving him on read. He messages again and says if he can get home around 5ish then we can still do something. I told him it was okay and that we could do another day. He then asks if I’m available the next day, I told him I’m free anytime before 5 because I work nights. He says he works until 3 so it would be a bit of a squeeze, I wasn’t bothered and said “Another time then”. He messaged back and suggested once again to come over and “Netflix and chill”.

2418,"Dating this girl is so, so exhausting (rant/venting)","Excuse me if I sound a bit aggravated and on edge in this post. It's been a long couple of weeks. If you think I'm an asshole, fine, whatever.

So, here's some background. I've been dating this girl for a month and a half. At first I thought she was the ultimate package. Smart, cute, funny. That lasted for a few dates and then the reality of what it would be like dating her set in.

She almost never initiates. If I want to hear from her, I have to message her. If I want to cuddle, I have to ask for it. She loves to go on and on about her life and what she's doing at work (fine) but NEVER asks about what I like to do or what I'm doing (NOT FINE). She repeats the same things to me over and over again like I am a child with zero capacity to remember things. This makes me feel like the most pathetic person alive. The idea that I would have to beg this girl for a crumb of cuddle is just humiliating.

I, being the idiot I am, decided to ask if she wanted to make things official despite these problems.

She said not yet and her reason for that answer was because she didn't know me well enough yet. She wants to meet my friends, know about my childhood, what I like to do in my free time, etc. And I'm sitting there thinking: ""Then why didn't you ask on any of the 6 dates we went on? Were you just not listening when I talked about what I enjoy doing?""

She said she wants to do some cooking at my place. Finally, some initiation. Ok, we can work with this. And then she proceeds to have absolutely ZERO idea what to make with me, leaving me to come up with an idea and buy all of the ingredients.

I am an extremely busy person. My time is extremely valuable and I figured 1.5 months was long enough for her to make a decision on this considering her last relationship ended at 2 months.The obvious answer is ""Lol stop dating her then."" Yeah, you're probably right. But I feel like a serious conversation about where things are going is necessary because who knows? Maybe she just doesn't realize how she comes off?

Dating was exciting at first but now I'm just exhausted and extremely frustrated. Am I just desperate? Probably but I would unironically prefer being single over this one-sided dating",dating
2419,How do you accept that your partner has a close friend that he used to have sex with?,"To start, I have a healthy and happy relationship with my partner, except there is one stickler. 

My partner used to be involved in an open relationship--he met someone, they dated/had sex, it didn't work out, and after years of developing a friendship and getting married, she opened her marriage and they had sex again for many years. She closed the relationship for other reasons. 

He said there was no feelings involved and it always just sex, which I believe. He doesn't flirt with her when they're together.

But, like I've seen in so many posts on here and other subreddits, it's hard. It's emotionally challenging to watch your partner be friends with someone they used to be close and had sex with. In my case, I'm glad that he doesn't show inappropriate affection to her, but she shows *so much affection* to him. She's giving him random gifts and tells him all about her life and feels very comfortable at his place (a shared space with a roommate). Part of me knows that this makes him a good guy: he is capable of a platonic relationship, he has a caring friend, and he isn't doing anything wrong! 

But I just can't seem to stomach this friendship... and I don't know how to process it. Exposure therapy? My anxiety goes through the ROOF when I'm around her or even worse when he is and I'm not. I don't like *her* behavior, even though this is technically a valid friendship. 

I've tried going to therapy and my therapists (grad students, so I'm hopeful that maybe there's a technique or something more about there as I search for someone fully licensed) said that it makes sense that I feel this way because it's an unusual situation: his relationship to her isn't bounded by conventional social norms and so it's harder for me to process. What do I say to myself? What do I do? 

I don't want to tell him to stop being friends with her because he acts appropriately, it's just that she likes him so much (but also: she's the one who ended things and then resumed something!!! it's weird and hard!!!). My partner has other female friends that I'm comfortable around, and his other relationships make sense because they follow conventional relationship rules where things stop and start in ways that make sense. 

Options in my head feel like: 

\- Are there boundaries I haven't thought about? 

\- How do I accept this? Do I try harder to become her friend? She doesn't live near us, but visits every few months, but I could text her or something. 

\- Are there questions I should ask him about the relationship? I don't want to pry and I feel as though I don't need to know anything else, because this is about me processing my feelings.",dating
2420,24M feeling discouraged,"I’m a 24-year-old guy. Ever since I was a young boy, mainly what I’ve wanted out of life is to have a deep, meaningful, and passionate romantic relationship. Since aging a bit, I’ve realized that it’s not going to happen like it does in the movies and it will take some effort and trials but am still feeling a bit discouraged. Not to boast, but I am an attractive guy (I have received confirmation from many sources) and am in good shape. 

For a long time, I was painfully shy, awkward, and timid, and was convinced girls didn’t like me. In high school, girls started to take interest but I was still shy and awkward and was always afraid that they wouldn’t like who I really was or wouldn’t be as passionate about it as I would be. Once I started to gain confidence from football and leadership roles, I still had not gained much confidence in the department of dating. There were always girls I had intense crushes on but didn’t pursue out of fear of jeopardizing a friendship or some other fear. Even some, I knew liked me as well. It seems like I’ve always taken it too seriously and just don’t know how to navigate dating. 

In college, I had one serious relationship. I met the girl from living in the same dorm and having some of the the same friend groups. We were friends before dating and had a lot of fun together but never kissed and were never intimate in the month and a half we were together. We were both devoutly Christian at the time, so that contributed to that. We broke up because we were starting to barely see each other and a lot of it felt forced towards the end. Since then, I’ve gone on dates, I’ve been aware of women who were interested, have pursued some of them, and none of it has resulted in anything romantic. I’d be lying if I were to say that I’ve put forth a great effort towards dating, but it’s just been so discouraging and it rarely ever feels right. It almost feels like an interview or a screening process that you’re supposed to act like is just “going out and having fun together.” 

Now, at 24 years old, I’ve been in one serious relationship and have never kissed a girl or had sex. I’m currently in grad school for a decently paying career that j find is important and meaningful. Sex isn’t my interest; I want to connect with someone, experience beauty, and create beauty and serve others through our union. I just mention this because it seems odd for my situation. Lady friends and older women I’ve been around have told me since high school that I’m a catch and will make someone very happy one day. I just wanna make some positive progress towards that. The idea of dating apps doesn’t appeal to me in the slightest due to how superficial they are. This being said, I’m now insecure about being a kiss-less virgin who’s attractive. It makes me think that she’d red flag that and pull away, thinking there’s something wrong with me. Dating makes me anxious still and it’s hard for me to know what to do. It’s not that I don’t meet women, it just hasn’t worked out like I want it to. 

I’m a sensitive soul, and I’m afraid to show all of that to a woman. In the past, I’ve felt as though women/girls I’ve talked to have lost interest quicker than I did because I opened up too much too soon. It’s a game that I’ve repeatedly failed at and have had little fun playing. On paper, I would seem like the kind of guy who would have a pretty active dating life. It just hasn’t happened that way. Maybe I am taking it too seriously, maybe I haven’t tried hard enough, and maybe there’s something wrong with how I’m communicating or presenting myself to women. If anyone is kind enough to offer me some advice, I’d really appreciate it. This isn’t for pity, as I’m very fortunate to live the life I live. It’s just that my intentions are to meet someone who I love with all of me and am motivated to provide for, encourage, and grow with for life. These seem like the right intentions for love and marriage.",dating
2421,My boyfriend cheated on me but we live together,So I’m f20 and my boyfriend is m28 we’ve been together for almost a year and we just recently moved in together five months ago we’ve had only one really big fight since we’ve moved in together but I still love him so very much I don’t have friends anymore because I cut them out of my life so all I do is work and spend time with my boyfriend I’ve always had a trust problem with him and he’s never been one to be open with his phone and early this morning I woke up to turn up the air conditioning since it’s the summer it gets hot I noticed my boyfriend’s phone on something in me told me to look through it and it wasn’t the first time I’ve done this but as I was looking through his phone in this recently opened apps was a dating profile this hurt me because why would my boyfriend have a dating account I looked to see who he had matched with and he had been texting all this other girls having conversations and this really broke me I didn’t know what to do we live together I’m so heartbroken,dating
2422,TMI on a first date…,"So I met someone on a dating app and we had been texting every day for a little over a week. We made plans for our first date and we both were excited.

We had some really good conversation and were just getting to know more about each other. Not long into our conversation we talked about how he used to have a sex positive podcast. I thought that was cool and I consider my self sex positive too. He asked how open I was about talking about sex and I said I’m pretty open talking about it.

He said “hmmm I’m trying to figure out how much I should tell you…” then proceeded to tell me about how he “effed a pregnant woman, had an@l sex with her, peed on her and peed in her mouth.” All with her and her husbands consent. He said he kept that up for a few months. He said it was kind of a “bucket list item”.

This disturbed me! I continued the date and we had great convo about many other things but after leaving and all day today I cannot stop thinking about how that was way tmi for a first date and it just gave me the ick. I’m not judging him but It truly made me lose all romantic interest in him.

He asked for a second date and I feel like I just need to tell him how I feel. I think I’m going to say this-

“I haven’t been able to get what you told me about the pregnant woman out of my head. It kind of perturbed me. I’m not judging you, I think you’re great, but I don’t think it was something that should have been mentioned on a first date. I feel like that made me lose romantic interest in you.”

Am I being judgy or would y’all agree this was a bit much!!!?",dating
2423,Break from dating,I lack the enthusiasm I used to have. Bunch of reasons to be honest. What is an effective time frame to take a break.,dating
2424,fear of dating,"so basically i’m turning 25 soon and i’m a dating virgin. never even held hands romantically. the older i get the worse it gets. i only ever had one single crush on my then best friend back in high school. he liked me back but nothing ever came of it.

it seems i have no luck with dating. i’m on and off on dating apps. i don’t really like these apps and would prefer meeting someone in the real world but at this time and age i feel basically forced to go on there. but it’s like a meat market and i only get weird questionable offers. i want to be seen for my personality not just my looks. i get frustrated, delete the app and then come back to it again at some point later. 

 it also seems like all the good people are already taken and there’s just this “residue” on dating apps, me included.

i actually think i don’t look too shabby and my personality is kind of okay too? i’ve had men interested in me in the past and got asked out several times. but there’s never been the right one for me among them. and i can’t shake the thought they weren’t ever being for real anyway.

my brain always tries to make me believe i’m part of some bet or that all the  men have some ulterior motive. it gets to the point where i’m actually afraid to meet up with men i meet on dating apps because i fear they’ll r-word or murder me. i’m aware that’s very unlikely but my brain is just wired that way and i can’t seem to turn it off… i really wonder how many chances i let off just because of this absurd fear. my friends happily go on their dating app dates without any kind of fear.

admittedly i generally don’t really feel comfortable around men but then again i kind of crave a romantic relationship. but i can’t shake the feeling that the guys i talk to only want that one thing and aren’t interested in me as a person. i envy those who just easily get into relationships and trust people enough.

i’m perfectly fine being single but i have those phases where i just feel super bummed out because everyone around me is in love and i don’t even know what love feels like.

lastly, i know people love to say “if you want to meet someone in real life you have to go out to the places you enjoy being at” i’ve been following that advice and still nothing ever came of it. 

i’m kind of starting to believe i’m not made to be in relationships at all and will probably die single haha…

thanks for reading this rant!",dating
2425,Mismatched sexual desires/styles,"I’ve been seeing this guy for over two months, we do get intimate regularly but not as much as I usually have with guys i date. A couple times when we haven’t it was bc I was on my period, but I still gave him a bj bc I was so turned on, other times he has said he’s tired, or another time we had taken edibles and he got too high so he just wanted to go to bed, understandably. When we do have sex, there isn’t really any sort of dirty talk or talk in general to set the mood, I try to instigate by asking “you like my __ don’t you” or asking him to tell me what he wants me to do to him. The last time he just replied “ummm can you give me a blowjob?” *not sexy, kind of a turn off tbh* would have loved for him to just take charge and tell me what to do or tell me how much he wants me, etc. He also rarely compliments me when he picks me up for dates, or ever, even though I do. I like this guy and we seem compatible, but I don’t feel desired by him, which makes it feel like more of a platonic connection. I wish he’d just be more aggressive sexually, maybe I’m kinkier than I thought? I know I need to have a conversation with him and explain how I feel, but I also don’t want to emasculate him. What do I say? And also is it even possible for someone to change like that?",dating
2426,What is the best way to open up a convo with a guy I find attractive out in public???,"Idc if it’s a pickup line, a question, idk.. but walking up to someone and straight up being like ARE YOU SINGLE?!

2427,I just blocked a guy for a lack of effort,"First date was amazing and the vibes were great, spent the next month tryna organise date 2 as we both had uni exams. Exams are over now, today was supposed to be the day of the date, he is supposed to come to my hometown and its about 45 mins on the train. An hour before we are due to meet i ask him what time his train gets in, he replies ‘when it gets to *my town* i guess’, so he clearly hadnt even glanced at a timetable yet even tho he would have to be on the train within the next 20 mins to be here for the time of the date, as well as this he said he didn’t know what to wear so he deffo still hadnt left the house, he also didnt get out of bed until 2:30 when the date was at 4

Im so confused like who doesn’t look a train timetable or pick an outfit before a date? So i replied and said ‘i feel like there is a real lack of enthusiasm from you shall we cancel?’ he replies saying ‘what?’ (like its a shock lmao?)

i then sent him a paragraph about how his continued lack of effort is very unattractive (he is an awful texter also) and that i enjoyed our first date but i need to be with someone who doesn’t make me feel like a burden or that im not worth the effort of doing simple things like washing his clothes or looking at a timetable, he opened it and didn’t reply so i just blocked him 

Did i handle this okay? he is deffo gonna think im psycho but im happy i stood up for myself i think

I have always been a people pleaser and i would usually let all that slide but i couldn’t stop thinking about how it we took things further he would be such a lazy partner if he doesn’t even put the effort in during the chase. He clearly wasn’t that into me and thats okay i just don’t understand why he wouldn’t just say",dating
2428,The guy I went on a date with lied about his looks,"I met a guy on hinge and on his profile it said he was 5'10 and when we met he had to be 5'5 (I'm F 5'4). I noticed on the date but didn't want to make a big deal right then and there so I didn't say anything but I definetly noticed. It started to bother me so a few days later I asked why it said 5'10 on his profile when it was obvious he wasn't. He had zero remorse and said ""well many of you care too much about height and I wanted more matches"". I'm like okay you do realize that one your lying and two that's not going to make someone like you. He genuinely thought I was just going to overlook this and keep talking to him. Guess what I didn't, He's unmatched and blocked. I honestly didn't find him physically attractive because of his size and the lying was the extra confirmation that I needed. Still annoyed I wasted my gas but whatever, taking another long break from online dating.  
  
Update: all that open-mindess goes out the window when you lie and purposely deceive someone for your own benefit. It's also my right to have a preference on the men I date. I don't have to give every man a chance just because they want one. The entitlement on this post is insane.

2429,Does it seem like people are getting too “meta” and talking a LOT about their dating history / experiences on the first few dates?,"This is an observation I have, and a pet peeve of mine. It seems more and more popular on first dates for people to discuss “how dating on the apps is going”, go through some synopsis of recent or whole dating history, or talk about a recent horrible (or worse, great) date or breakup. Even going so far as to ask for dating advice and talking about other dates they’ve been on since they started seeing you??

I’ve always felt getting into those details on a first date is a little weird, a little lame, and honestly kills a bit of the mystery and fun of meeting someone for the first time and slowly getting to know them. It’s like an unrequested info dump and a “here’s what you’re competing against / don’t do this” lecture all at once. 

And these aren’t just people that aren’t interested and using me as a sounding board - many of them are very interested in dating and/or hooking up.",dating
2430,Should I tell my friend how I feel? Or wait and see what happens?,"I have a friend (24M) who I (23F) have been starting to have feelings for in the last 2 months. We met in college and have known each other for about 1.5 years, but didn't start becoming close until more recently when I ran into him at a friend's birthday and we basically reconnected. In the last 2 months we have been spending more time together, texting, and flirting. I only see him on weekends as we live 2 hours apart. We haven't kissed yet, as I was waiting for him to make a move, but I definitely felt like he was giving signals of being into me, and had become more flirty in the last few weeks. I also believed I was giving him positive signals as well. I was content to see where things go. I think he is more of a shy guy and not the type with a ton of experience with girls.The other night we went out with a group of friends to dinner and drinks. At dinner, him and I sat together and he was being flirty (touching me while talking, focusing on me in conversation, finding excuses to touch me). I was obviously happy about this and we were talking most of the night. Afterwards, we went out for drinks and dancing. On the dance floor I noticed another girl in our friend group (26F) who suddenly pulled him to the side and kissed him. When I saw, I suddenly felt really sad. I continued dancing with my female friends there and ended up leaving about an hour later. He seemed really focused on her after they kissed and was dancing with her, but still wanted to make sure I got home safely.I guess I am wondering what I should do at this point. I am not one to compete for guys, and when I saw him showing interest in another girl, I felt like I was supposed to move on because I assumed I just read everything wrong. However, in speaking to 2 of my friends, both said that I should see where it goes. I am not really upset at him or our other friend because I had never told her about my feelings (we aren't close, just in a mutual friend group), and to be fair, since I haven't said anything to him, he could just be uncertain of my feelings. My friends said he is probably into me, and that it could just be that he didn't know how I was feeling, and this girl was more obvious. They also said that she is just like that with guys, so they don't know if she really likes him, or if it was just because of the drinks that the two of them kissed.What do you think I should do? I think he is into me, and I'm guessing he is also into this other girl, or he liked the attention. Should I just tell him how I feel? Ask him out? Or would that be wrong? I don't have a lot of experience dating, and my only other relationship started off as friends where the guy ended up making the first move, so letting things develop naturally is what feels normal and familiar to me, hence me wanting to reach out for advice. I care about him as a friend too and would definitely stay his friend through either way. Thanks for your advice :)",dating
2431,Ladies: What is the reason behind the boring 3 word replies?,"Pretty much, exactly what the title says. Obviously this doesn't apply to all the girls in the online dating scene, furthermore, I know guys can be the same way. But I know I'm not the only ""paragraph texter"" out here that texts exactly how they speak. Typically I try not to have much of a conversation over text, I usually try to plan a date then leave it alone until said date, but in the cases where they aren't available for anything soon, and there's mutual interest in having a conversation to get to know each other, why do people send short replies after showing interest in said conversations? 

It's really exhausting and after so many ghosts, it always ends up seeming like I'm the only one contributing to the conversations that I thought we both wanted to have. I try to avoid menial topics and starters like ""wyd"", or ""what's your favorite color?"" and always try and show at least a bit of effort with interesting topics like life goals, desires, and even some more spicy topics of the person is okay with that sort of topic. I just want to know if it's even worth it trying to have conversation with people I meet online, or if I should just try harder or maybe even just hang up the tinder profile.

I had pepper spray in my purse if I needed it, but I was super nervous the whole time.

The tour was light-hearted and we had a really great time on the date. After getting to know him better, it doesn't seem that he'd ever hurt anyone. I just want a third party perspective.

Long story short. I ended it out of suspicions he was seeing someone else. Due to flopping on the last two dates and always having the most perfect detailed excuse. 

Anyway. He removed me from social media but what caught my attention was that he made it all private after I ended it. We never even spoke to each other on social media or interacted on social media. So I was so confused why even make it private… plus he had his profile public for years. So why make it private immediately after I ended it and I’ve never done anything crazy or said I did anything crazy to anyone’s socials after it ending.
Now I’m thinking I was definitely the side chick… now I have this sickening feeling in my stomach that I just slept multiple times with someone’s husband/bf…

Cheating is something I hate.. my mom was the “other woman” for over 6 years and it was sickening seeing how he’d use her and how stupid she’d fall for his manipulation and gaslighting… I was even more sick when he’d bring his kids to our home to have my mom babysit and lie about my mom being a “friend” from church and this guy would send pics of his kids to me. A lot.

2443,Virgin at 23 years,"Hello there.  
  
Last week I turned 23 years old. I currently am a master student in molecular genetic doing my thesis and I started to realize that i am becoming old. As the title say, i am still a virgin, never kissed or started a relationship.  
  
My parents are divorced sence i am 12(my father let my mother for another woman), and I swore never to do what my father did. I focus on my studies in sciences since then and in my hobby of writing (I am writing a book) and I never persuid a relationship.  
  
When i enter on puberty, besides i starting like girls, I never found anyone that I really like (besisdes a crush in my 9th grade), and i did my high school without dating or being interested in anyone. In that time, i think that i will have time in the future for that.  
  
I started university and on my fisrt year i fall in love by a girl of my course, but she threatened me to call her boyfriend to «talk to me» if i looked at her again(when that happned was in my second year and I wasn't interested in her anymore after she rejected a invation to dinner) . It traumatized me in a way that I only now think I've recovered from it. Months later, my hair started to fall and almost six months ago i started to get tinnitus, phantom noises, because of cold after a covid infection.  
  
Since my highschool, never a girl was interested in me. I am a nerd (love science and pop culture, star wars and other movies) and since child i prefer to be alone and do my things. I always thinked that i had time to date on the future. Now I am 23 years old and I see lot of my friends or getting in relationships or envolved in casual sex. I like girls but the idea of getting in casual sex seems gross to me, besides that in same way the girls dont have interest on me, its really hard to me to «fall in love» or whatever, even before of my trauma with that girl.  
  
This is more of a rant than other thing, but what can i do to improve my situation. I am good in sciences and in writing, but besides of intelectual work, by skills on dating are miserable. My friends give different advices to me. Some say that i need to grow up (grow up in what?, they dont say), other say that i need to take care of my self, others say that i need to go out and search for one (the ideia of chasing a woman like a dog in heat sounds ridiculous), other says that will happen when i am not searching up, when least expect. For me dating seems so complicated and irregular, like an expoired sea full of rocks and the compass don't work, basically i feel lost. I never hated girls, even after my trauma, i love my mother and my sister and i have a lot of female friends. I believe that the people are free to love and chose their own path. If the girls dont want me, the most simple explanation taht is my fault for the situation that I am.  
  
What will happen in ten years when all of my friends start to marry and have kids and i remained alone with my doctorade and surrounded by machines as my only company? I am really scared that dark future that I see.

I started talking to her a few weeks ago.  We hang out. I like her. She seems to enjoy my company.  I don't know how to tell her that she chews loud. She could be upset and jeopardize our relationship. I've been trying to ignore that loud chew sound.  Looking for wisdoms in the thread",dating

2446,To chase or not to chase: A girl,"So I don't chase girls.  I ask them out once and if I get anything other than a yes with their availability, I never ask or text them again.  Just wondering if a girl says she's too busy right now and doesn't mention when she's available in the future, does that mean no?  Because that's how I interpret it currently.  

In other words, should I ask one more time to see if she bites?",dating
2447,How to get over someone who you know is not gonna be in love with you ever??,"Idk how to explain this feeling in my chest. There is this one guy whom im badly attached too. Been 5 years, we dated for 6 months then he cheated on me, then no contact, then friends again, and now fwb which is kinda off and on. I am at that phase of my life where i am going to start a new chapter and that's a perfect opportunity to get over someone like him.

Altho i have tried everything to make him love me from helping with projects and be nice to him, providing emotional support, treating him well, and be there for him all the damn time.

But he has done nothing for me. I am not complaining but even a nice gesture or treat someone good who is doing so much for you goes a long way and sad part is i never stopped trying. 

But now i am tired, including my heart, soul, and mind. I don't know how to allow myself to completely detach from him and give myself another chance. Maybe i am too used to that hot and cold behaviour. I think no one is ever gonna love me and i feel broken and violated. I did everything, not to brag, but literally everything and i got nothing in return. There is no future to our bond. I am just watering a dead plant. I want to move on, there is nothing b/w us but still im loyal to him. I feel so bad and that's why i need to come here and share and seek advice.

We never sat and actually had a communication and ik that’s the main problem. We just did everything with the flow. He is good and nice at one day and after we get intimate he is distant again. I am just getting used. And whenever i try to offer smth like that- no answer coz it only happens when he wants.

I have been to therapy too and now i am at that point where i am exhausted as hell. I am just letting myself to get hurt again and again.",dating
2448,First date after a 20 years of marriage was good till the end,"I (36m) went on my first date (32f) Saturday night. I got her number from a coworker. We texted for about a week and half till the date. We met at a bar and had a couple drinks, then walked to another for some more drinks. I thought we really hit it off. Had some great conversations and lots of things in common. At the end, when it was time to go, I already had a Uber available that would either take us back to my place or take her home if she wanted. She didn't want to leave her car there and insisted on driving. I told her I didn't think that was a good idea. As I went and closed out the tab, she vanished. I texted and called wondering where she was with no reply. I went home, and didn't hear from her till the next day. She apologized for leaving the bar and said she wanted to drive and I wouldn't allow her that. It's just a bummer such a night came down to that. I don't know if maybe I dodged a bullet and she's probably not the one or what. I will say though, it was a hell of a confidence boost getting back into the dating pool and getting one under my belt.

My dating profile has no edited photos and ones where you can see my entire body, yet I’m still anxious when they see me in person they’ll be disappointed.

2452,What is life like with the right person?,"So I wanted to ask this question that’s been on my mind for a while. What is life like with the right person? I am wondering about this because I think all my life(or at least for a long time) I felt alone in this world. Even though I have a loving family and a twin brother that’s like my best friend. I still feel emotionally detached from everyone. I don’t want to feel this way but I just do. Like my family is usually busy to talk to me, and my twin brother wants too much alone time to himself. I feel that I don’t get enough attention also. I know my family wants me but do they actually need me? That’s what I sometimes ask myself. I also don’t really have many friends mostly because I’ve been betrayed by people I thought were my friends, so I’m kind of afraid to open up to people a little bit lol.

Anyways… about the right person thing. To the people that have found that right person(or at least think they have) do you feel like they’re your best friend and do you feel a emotional connection with them on a deeper level? I’m wondering this because I think what I’m needing is a partner or at least a best friend I can connect to on a deeper level. It’s just I haven’t found that yet. I try to connect with my twin brother and stuff but he only wants to be by himself most of the time.

I know maybe some of you will say to just find happiness being by yourself and do stuff you want to do etc. But here’s the thing… THAT GETS OLD after a while, at least for me it does. I need a connection with someone. Even if it’s just ONE person.

I’m not sure why I typed this but I guess I just want to see if there’s some sort of hope that maybe this loneliness isn’t forever and maybe I’ll get lucky one day and find that person I can connect with.",dating
2453,I (26m) had a first relationship that lasted 5 years but have had almost no success in the 4 years since,"Ive noticed that a lot of people I know always have something going on dating wise even if casualy. I'm someone who the main thing I desire is a relationship and/or to be intimate/close with someone again even if this included casual experiences, realistically it's all I think/care about (not that anyone on the outside would be able to know about that obsession which is a good thing) idk I'm just a relationship/intimacy focused person, I have other interests but it's what gets me out of bed so you can imagine I'm struggling without it for so long.

Which is what has made the 4 years since (in which I moved to a major city for university) so hard/demoralising. The irony being that other people I know barely care about it from my perspective but a lot of these things seems to come their way whilst I've had very little to speak of in those 4 years since my relationship... I've kissed 4 girls in that time (only 2 of those under circumstances I look back on in a positive way). And only had one girl who was interested in dating me in that time but it didn't materialise because it would of been long distance and think there was compatability issues anyway.

Obv the reality of this situation of my isolation and lack of interest from girls during this time has really lowered my confidence and altered my self perception like how I look at myself in the mirror (not that it shows to others). I'm aware there must be factors/things I'm doing wrong or not enough but if you knew me in real life you'd probs be surprised about my lack of this kind of activity - I have quite a lot of friends (including girls) and think people would say I'm fairly charismatic and socialy confident but maybe this is just in a friendly way that I can't convert to romantically.",dating

The reason was because i was telling an anecdote to my friend about a gay men that hit me up my dm to ask to do something the two alone after we met one day prior. 

Since i have never been in a date or never had sex i disguarded the offer but it’s just right now that im’ realizing im’ maybe missing the occasion to do something i have never done before. For context i have always been straight even tho practically everyone in my entourage thinks im’ gay even tho i am always talking about attractive girls and cannot find any guy attractive. before today i had never tought about this kind of stuff and it is only when i got lost in my toughts that i fantisized about having a gay sex experience for the first time.

We have met in person twice (she is just 3 years old) which he suggested, not me and I thought it was lovely. 

I just don’t understand, he did not break up with me. Continued to hold me, kiss me and speak about other things for hours into the evening, we slept together later that evening. 

I was sort of in shock to be honest and didn’t really ask any questions because I didn’t know what to ask, I was confused and still am and heartbroken too. I always imagined when the time was right I would be a part of her life. I told him that I would have loved to be a part of her life one day and he said maybe he would have loved it too but he doesn’t want that.

When he was leaving in the morning I told him I loved him and he didn’t say it back, instead he held my face and called me cutie. I regret it now but I then told him I loved him again and he said it back but in a way that was either because he didn’t love me or because he didn’t want to love me.

edit: i got a job near where she goes to school so we might not be going long distance (i didn’t apply for her, it was my goal). and she texted me this morning that she’s not ready to give up. she said we still have more conversations to have and that might change things, but might not. which i absolutely respect. im just glad she’s open to the idea of communicating about this. im glad she’s starting to let some of her walks down. i’ve never connected with anyone how i do with her. we communicate so well with each other that it makes me want to talk it out. sharing how i feel never turns into an argument, she never disrespects me or belittles me. i just love her man, but im still gonna put myself first at the end of the day",dating

2466,Is it okay to go on a date with more than one woman?,"I (23M) have not been dating since high school, and now am trying to change this. Yey!

Anyways, here is the situation. I met one girl while traveling and she showed interest in me (like asking for my Insta, telling me that we should go to a coffee someday and so on) and I told myself: well, why not? 

So I called her for a date (we did not call it that way, but I think we both are aware it is) and she agreed. I am still unsure how I feel about her, but why not to give it a try, after being dating avoidant for so long? At best, something nice can happen, and at worst - we will both gain some experience and have some good time.

However, there is this another girl that works in a store I regularly go to - and she always smiles to me, looks at me and gives me some vibe that I think might be ""I am interested in you thing"". Last time I started talking to her and we exchanged few words, but there were other customers so I had to leave, not to get her in trouble. Now, this might mean nothing, just a small talk. Still, I realised I might want to try to ask her for a number when I see her next time, and if she agrees, call her on a date.

Now, is this fair play? Or should I wait for one date to finish and see what will come from the first situation before approaching the other girl?",dating

My most recent dating experience has left me feeling irritated and demotivated to keep trying (see post history), so I’m just ready to do me for a little while. I would love to hear what others have done during their dating breaks that have aided their personal development, brought new experiences and just generally added some non-dating related zest to their lives.

2470,The current dating climate is making me suicidal.,"Let me preface this by saying I (27M) don't have any issue with getting a woman. There's several women that regularly contact me (toxic people always have something up with their phone) to ""perform""... this issue is, that I can only get laid. 

I can't get a relationship for the life of me. I could do everything right, & genuinely keep my expectations low... then I'll just get ghosted. Yet like some sick twisted joke, i could walk up to a random woman in bar. Look her dead in the eye, & say something like, ""I guess I'd let you choke me."" ... then somehow I'll end up back at her place.

Yes,  I've been in plenty of relationships... All of which have ended within 3 months for one of 3 reasons: 

my disorders being too big of a concern (type 1 bi-polar, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD, & manic depression)

I find out their a genuinely bad person 

 or  I get ghosted for being to easy.

To my first point; I get why my disorders can be too much, but I actively do A-LOT to reign everything in. People are always shocked that I'm mentally ill. I train MMA CONSTANTLY to maintain my endorphins, & then try to process negative emotions. I write everything from poetry, to long form stories... I even refuse to drink alcohol when I'm depressed, & monitor my nicotine consumption when I'm anxious/stressed.

The last two points go sort of hand in hand... I genuinely belive how you love speaks volumes about you as a person, down to your most fundamental morals. This sometimes makes women think I'm a doormat, & one of two things happen: Usually I notice a series of manipulative plays, & break things off. The inverse is that I get dumped for not giving her some kind of conflict.

The kicker in all of this is... I have an IQ of 130. I could easily play ""games"" with dating... the thing is: playing games with someone's emotions is sociopathic. Now these games are officially the standard of dating.

sure there's no motivation to being a ""good man"", but goodness dies with incentives. What's torturing me is that being s decent man just gets you hurt now. While toying with women has many incentives, and even more securities.

To top all this off, I'm a romantic. I love doing those little, or possibly grand gestures to show my love. Everything from a text with a line of poetry I just came up with, to making every woman on the dance floor jealous of my date... yet all of those romantics get me tossed aside. 

Normally with a rant like this, there's some a egregious flaw that the OP is entirely unaware of. For years now I was trying to figure out what my flaw was. 

That's where the real tragedy hits, I'm always getting calls/run ins from exes... They're always crying about how some other man treated them after me. They'll hit me with the entirety of toxicity in all these talks. However; I'm always clear that I'm never going back to someone who hurt me so... not like any of them would leave the new guy anyway.

Do you any of you have any idea what this is like? Trying to just be a good person, & be a good man to someone you love... but women would literally prefer to be getting abused by a guy less attractive, less wealthy, worse in bed, & has no personality nor morality.

One ex ghosted me after I guessed her favorite flowers on valentine's day, now her new bf is a bald douche who manages (but really steals all the income from) her OF... that HE talked HER into. Obviously I hope she gets into a better situation, but that's just out of baseline human decency.

Another ex dumped me after I basically wrote all of her essays her first year in college. The guy she left me for made her drop out, & now viciously beats her... she posts old memories of us together on her snap whenever they argue. I tried getting her in contact with certain services for women in those situations, but ultimately gave up on her when she started defending that scumbag. 

That's why I want to just end all of this... I'm at this twisted impasse. Either I give in, & become a horrible person... or I die alone.",dating

2474,"Just give me a straight up answer, don’t sugar coat it.","What’s up with this dude? 

I (22) met a guy (21) over a month ago at a college bar. He was staring at me all night, but never approached me so finally when he just stayed lingering around me all night, I finally said something to break the ice. He sat with me all night, but didn’t say much, but also wouldn’t leave my side. I took it as he wasn’t interested so I didn’t bother asking for his number or anything and left that night in the dust. 

The next morning, his friend snapchats my girl friend I was out with and says his buddy, the one I met, really wanted my number. I gave it to him through his friend which was weird, but I figured maybe he’s shy so I found it kinda cute. He texts me a couple hours later and we text for a week and the conversation was pretty dry and he took a long time to reply. So I stopped texting, figured he wasn’t interested or was stringing me along. 

A couple days later, after i stoped texting him, he asked if I wanted to go get ice cream and “hangout” at like 10:00 PM. I wasn’t sure if that meant hooking up, which I’m not interested in, but I agreed anyway and the date itself was fine. We cuddled a little and watched TV and talked and that was it. Super innocent.

I texted him after the date, saying thanks for paying and yadda yadda, and he continued the conversation. Like before, still pretty dry and we would take hours to respond, but he kept it going.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, he texted me saying hes home for summer break and I joked and said “ok see you never ig” and he said he’d see me again when he’s back. But he sorta left me on read after and he’s not back till August. We haven’t texted since and I doubt we’ll text again.

Is this dude playing me, is he immature, shy, or am I reading too much into this? Maybe he’s just not into texting, but to me, that shows a level of disinterest. How can he swoop back in August when we’re not gonna text all summer? Or am I delusional for thinking he’ll actually hit me up again? I’m just confused.

Hope this all makes sense, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!😅",dating
2475,How do I begin to date given my sexual history?,Im 18 I have only been in two sexual relationships were the only reason the girls were with me is because I was spending money on them and giving them money to spend. The first situation was spur of the moment and when I was around 17 years old the 34 year old asked me for money to help pay a bill and after I helped her we had sex almost as a reward I didn't speak to her again after that.I thought that this was how men are supposed to keep girls around so this time I got myself into a situation where I wanted to meet a girl as I took a liking to her so I gave her some money to spend when she came to my city we did meet and have sex but immediately after she blocked me on everything. Its only now that I have been blocked that I recognise the relationships that I am having with these women is the exact same as paying for sex as the women didn't like me for me but what I could provide how do I move away from these types of relationships and when entering relationships in the future how do I tell them about me basically paying for sex in the past?,dating
2476,First nice guy post two toxic relationships! Meeting the family tomorrow!,"Okay, so I (33f) and “Bob” (39M) have been friends for about 5 years. We run in the same concert going/small town bar crowd. Well neither of us hit the bar too much anymore. It’s just where we met. 

Anyways I’ve had two pretty toxic relationships. One was very physically abusive and the other was just extremely neglectful and I thought it was normal because he wasn’t hurting me. 

Bob and I have been texting pretty consistently for the last 6 months and hung out a few times. I’m a single mom and he works a ton. We both were supportive during a break up. Recently he told me that he adores me and would like to know if I’d be open to him taking me on an actual date and see where things go. I am 100% down. Well tomorrow we are seeing each other for the first time since then and I am going with him to a family cook out. 

I’m extremely nervous and kind of trauma dumped all my baggage, because I don’t know how to date the nice normal guy. I apologized and said sorry if that was too heavy and he said it was a lot and it was heavy, but not too much and asked if I had ever had someone in my corner, because now I do. I’m worried he is regretting inviting me to this event now, because anxiety is a jerk and I am nervous in a way I have never been because now it is known we both have feelings towards each other. Any and all advice welcome.",dating
2477,My question is to the girls on dating apps.,"
Why do you provide your insta or snap username in your bios ?   And on what basis you swipe right ?    

On bumble why you unmatch ? (Is it because you dont want to text first ?)",dating
2478,Is there truly someone for everyone?,"I’m not the best looking guy, although I’m ugly either, just average. Due to my horrible social anxiety since elementary school, I’ve got little to no girls in my social circle.

I’m heading off to university soon and was wondering if there truly is someone for everyone or is that just a myth?",dating
2479,Should i bother with online dating if I think down the line there is a possibility that I will end up dating my best friend?,"Not too long ago I ended up just expressing my feelings to her and she reciprocated but long story short the timing wasn't right so we can't date. Although we aren't dating I think down the line there is a possibility that we will end up dating. With this in mind should i bother with online dating?

edit: So i did use online dating before. I had decent success with online dating as that is how I met my ex. Got an ok amount of dates with different girls from the short time i used it. It's just that i found online dating pretty time consuming and meeting new people was draining. I've also noticed that it's a lot harder to find compatible people from online dating. For example with my ex she was a sweet girl it was just that i found out we were so different, her values were really different from mine, her sense of humor was different from mien so in the end i had to break up with her since i didn't see us going long term

This is actually why i want to date my best friend. I've notice when ur friends with someone u are friends with them because u share similar values and sense of humor",dating
2480,Are questionable morals a red flag in men?,"I’ve been dating my current bf for a few years and he’s basically perfect: he’s tall, cute, intelligent, caring, polite, high-earning and loves to cook. 

One thing that I’ve noticed, however, is that while he’s not predatory, he is willing to lie, manipulate, and bend rules to get things done. When we were dating in college, he would tell me about loopholes in his class syllabi, elaborate schemes to get his professors to bump his grades, etc. and now he’s doing the same thing with business and office politics. I’m sure that he’s working some sort of strategy on me as well, even though he seemingly does whatever I tell him to.

It never occurred to me that this might be a red flag, I always thought it was quite impressive. But I was talking with a friend the other day and she said that she could guarantee this wouldn’t end well for me, and to get out while I still could. I don’t plan on doing so, but is this a big of a red flag as I’m being told?",dating

2482,Serious Question: Are Monogamous Relationships worth it in 2023,"I don’t want to come up as dramatic, but I’ve started to seriously question being in a monogamous relationship. I am 25M and just got out of relationship. My ex girlfriend of 6 years cheated on me. I have started to notice a growth and acceptance with work spouses and female and male friendships. These friendships, while not always, become romantic even if one party is already in a relationship. It’s very hard to find women who do not want to entertain another man in their life in one way or another. At this point I think the best option would be to never go back to a serious relationship. 

Moreover, I have also started to seen a trend going on on social media were 40 to 60 year old women leave their husbands because they “grew in different directions”, what ever that means.",dating

2484,my boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me and then harmed himself…,"i (23F) met my now ex (27M) on hinge about 2 months ago, and we dated for a bit over a month. he has treatment resistant depression, anxiety, and OCD, but was always extremely kind and caring to me. his mental health was getting progressively worse the past 2wks or so, and he broke up with me because he felt that he wasn’t ready to date, and needed to focus on his own mental health - he didn’t feel like he could add as much value to my life as i did his, and didn’t want to take me down with him as he’s spiraling out of control. i was obviously upset, and then he had a breakdown because he had hurt my feelings, and then hurt himself that night. we talked one more time and said our goodbyes.

this was a very difficult situation for me. i’ve been in relationships before, but they all ended because we didn’t love each other anymore. my now-ex and i both still like each other and care about each other, but given his mental state, we both agreed that it’s better this way; i cannot add more stress on him when he is already suffering so much. However, im still having a lot of trouble accepting it, and am still heartbroken over it. he is a wonderful man and always made me feel happy and safe, and he says that i had made him just a little bit happier when he was in so much pain. i suppose it is a bit of a right person wrong time scenario.

has anyone ever been in a situation like this? any support would be appreciated ❤️",dating
2485,I (23M) really like this girl (23F) and need advice on how to approach the situation,"TLDR: Met cute girl while playing videogames and have visited her twice. Haven't made a move yet as I'm afraid of fucking it up. Need help on how to approach the situation as i really like the girl. Slightly long distance.

2 years ago I met this really nice girl while playing videogames. We had good chemistry, but not really anything serious, just good friends. We both ended up taking a break from this game to focus on other things and as a result the friendship kinda fated out.

Around 4 or 5 months ago i got back into the game and one day saw that she was also online, so i decided to send her message just saying stuff like long time no see and if she wanted to play for a bit. Over the next couple of months we played a ton and the messages between us would sometimes be kinda flirty. We then decided that we would like to meet up and actually talk in person. We live around an hour too an hour and a halv train ride away from each other so this isn't that big of a problem. We set up a date for when i would go an visit her and agreed that i would stay for the night because of the travel over to her.

The date came where we would meet and it was great. Conversations were flowing great and we laughed a ton. I was going so well that i ended up staying for 2 more nights because we just liked being with each other. Her sister then ended up moving in with her because of some relationship problems and this kind of put a stop on me visiting her. Fast forward a little over a week or so from my first trip and i get a call from her at around 7 pm saying that her sister had gone home to their mom's house to work from home and that i could come visit her while her sister wasn't there. Now she had drunk a bit when she called me but nothing major so i thought why not, we had such a good time last i visited her. When i arrived at her place i found out that while I was getting ready and on the train ride, she had gone out drinking some more, so by the time I arrived she was pretty drunk. We then went straight to bed because we were both tired and she had a bit of work in the morning. Before we ended up falling asleep she would end up asking if I wanted sex. While i would like to have sex with her as i really like her i decided to decline as she was clearly drunk and probably didn't realize what she was saying. The next few days went just like the last time I was with her. I did tell her the morning after what she had done and she clearly felt embarrassed. I really wanted to kiss her during this visit, but whenever we would get longer periods of eye contact or our faces would be close, she would always end up covering her mouth after a bit.

Here comes the part that i need advice on. I'm very bad whenever it comes to making the first move or picking up on hints because of previous experience so I usually end up not trying. What I need help with is whether or not i should talk to her about this or say something like ""I really like you and wanted to give you a kiss but didn't know when"". Or should I wait for the next time we meet and just go for it. Don't know when next time would be so I'm afraid that if i wait to long it will be too late. 

Sorry for the long post.

Update: So i have been talking to her a bit now and it seems that the feelings are mutual, which makes me super happy. I am also meeting up with her next week and I will definitely try to make a move then. Thanks for all the advice.",dating
2486,"Been seeing a new guy for a few weeks, he's kinda awkward? We had sex, I don't know what to think","Account for anonymous reasons. Bit nsfw and long..

Okay so I 34F been trying out the whole dating thing through apps the last few months. Had a relationship of 5 years that ended about 2 years ago and I've been feeling lonely. Even tho I've been seeing a guy from work and had a few dates in my free time it never really clicked for me. I consider myself pretty fit and good-looking, doing sports etc. Been always an outgoing happy persona.

While using the app I got a lot of matches but most were just thirsty men asking for nudes or sex, yikes. Had a few dates with some guys but somehow it always revolved around sex for them. Had one guy that was pretty nice been on a second date with him and while we were sitting at a cafe he just said kinda rushed he needs to pee, stood up and I've never seen him ever after. Texted him later and he said there was a friend of him that saw him and well he confessed that he was in a relationship and was looking for a side chick, like What the hell?? Blocked him and wanted to delete the app after because I just felt exhausted.

I didn't touch the app for some days and just opened it up again just because... I was desperate 😭

Here begins the story.

Got new messages most were sexual pickup lines about my body, word plays with my name, the usual stuff. Men 😮‍💨

One guy blantly wrote like a quick paragraph about himself. And build a big cat emoji (lol?) With letters and signs. I responded, we talked a bit. Been texting with him the following days. He seemed nice, no signs of sexual advances, Sometimes kinda awkward like always when I wanted to get to know him better and asked more personal stuff he kinda gave vague and awkward answers. He was honest but always short answers and I couldn't really get a hold of his personality.

He is 28M, good looking, athletic build, tall 6'4 or something and seemed nice I guess.

So I asked him about a date, which felt kinda weird because it's always the guys asking me and not the other way around 😅. Was a new feeling for me to ask someone and waiting for a response. Gotta say I was kinda nervous while waiting haha

He said yes we got on a coffee together. Sat at the cafe talked for about 1 hour, well it was mostly me talking. He answered questions, and tried to get the conversation more running but it felt always a bit awkward. He seemed a bit spaced out. He said he is just nervous and apologized. After the coffee we walked together to my car and said goodbye to each other. I wanted to hug him goodbye but he was kinda awkward and didn't lean in so we had a half hug ? 😅 And I got In my car and drove home. Btw he looks way better In reality than on his pics,lol kinda like a model .

Couldn't quite stop thinking about him that evening. Talked with a girl friend on the phone told her everything. To be honest, I wanted to end the contact here with him because I didn't feel a connection between us and you know I was just so exhausted from all the dating. Works been also pretty tough lately. My friend said not to make a hasty decision and just see what happens the next days.

The next day he didn't write me any messages, I also didn't. One day later I asked him if he ghosted me. He said he had much work etc. But at the end he asked for a second date and we went for another coffee in the evening after work. He seemed a bit more relaxed but was still pretty reserved. Tried talking more about him, we both like to go to the gym, he got more relaxed when we talked about it. He visits the gym daily for years which explained his body. He finally got a bit more responsive there we talked more, he made some jokes, we laughed. I felt pretty safe in his presence and kinda started liking him..aybe even falling abit in love 🙈.

I tried reaching for his hand a few times but he didn't try touching mine. We talked about work, hobby's. I told him about my previous dating experience, asked about his but he didn't wanted to talk about his past much. It seemed like he didn't have a relationship in a long time or maybe ever?

 It felt kinda awkward for me the whole time because I wanted to get more physical contact but he never initiated anything. Like holding hands, touching me. I tried initiating a few more times but he never did anything back. I stopped then. We took a walk in the local park. Talked more, departed. Again I hugged him at the end, this time he also hugged me ☺️

I don't really know what's going on with me at this point. I've always been a confident outgoing person. Never been shy in my life. But he seems so  , I'm sorry, weird? That I don't know how to act around him. 

Again that night I talked with my friend about it. She was just happy I found someone haha. 

Yesterday I invited him over to my flat after work. I didn't want sex and I'm by far not someone that's considered a easy girl 😅 We cooked together and wow he can cook and knows quite some stuff. He said he taught himself to cook for himself fresh for years, I mean I could tell by his body. We drank a bit of wine, I maybe drank a bit to much, got all giggly and touchy 😭

Fast forward, sitting on the couch watching a movie. I've been getting up to get another glass of wine for myself. When I came back I sat closer to him, leaning a bit against him. He made some jokes while watching the movie, talked a bit nonsense in between. I just enjoyed the moment feeling safe and sound with him, had a smile on my face and felt really happy for the first time in months ☺️. The wine made me more tipsy and well I wanted more..

Got closer to him, laid my head against his chest. He put his arm around me. He was still telling me dumb jokes about the movie. I just laughed even tho I didn't quite understand the jokes.

He didn't make a move till now just held me in his space. I leaned in we kissed. We kissed slowly, he was so cautious and stroked my hair. I was way to drunk at this point and only felt my hormones going through the roof. 🙈

We kissed a bit more, went to my bedroom. He didn't speak much while we were at it. I didn't either. I don't know it felt like we were connected on another level. We had sex and I have to say this was the best sex of my entire life 🙈🙈.

He kissed my whole body, and was so gentle and cautious but went a bit harder every now and then. I never liked getting spanked or being held down but with him, I don't know it just felt right. And was a constant change between gentle sex and well abit harder 🫠. We didn't talk anything the whole time, it was dark in my room, he didn't make much sounds it was mostly me moaning. He was really quiet.

And well the sex lasted for 3 hours. I kid you not, this man has the endurance of a pornstar. I thought I'd lose my mind in between. I've never been stimulated so much. It was mind numbing my whole body trembled and I felt like in ecstase. He didn't came once and after 3 hours I told him we need to stop. I was just at my end, couldn't think straight anymore, my body felt numb, like I would fall into a coma any second.

I wanted to be nice and finish him off by oral but he didn't came and after 10 min he looked me in the eyes and said ""it's ok you look exhausted"" lol. I was  running sweat like a river, my bed was wet from our sweat, I looked like I ran a marathon. We quickly went in the shower, I put a new bedsheet on after and we cuddled a bit more and fell asleep. Well I fell instantly in a comateus sleep 😭

This morning my phone alarm got off, we went out of bed, dressed ourselves ate a bit and said goodbye. He kissed me and went home, or to work? I don't know.

I still felt extremely exhausted, called in work to say I'm sick (🙈🙈🙈) and been sleeping till noon. Woke up an hour ago, ate something and now writing this.

I didn't text him, neither did he. It was a magical experience and I'm having such strong feelings at the moment. I can't think straight. I don't know much about him and he seems so distant. But I'm developing such strong feelings at the moment 🙈😭 I can't reach my friend at the moment, she's at work and I don't know what to do now. I feel like I want to live my whole life with this man 🫠

2488,I think I have a girlfriend,"I’ve been seeing this amazing girl I met on Hinge for a while now. We’ve been on six dates so far, shared some really good moments together (including some romantic ones), and she’s started referring to me as her significant other.

I’m thrilled about this, but we haven’t had the ‘exclusive’ talk yet. Although it seems like we’re heading in the right direction, I want to make sure I’m not assuming anything or rushing things.

From your experiences, when do you think is the right time to ‘define the relationship’? How should I bring this topic up without putting any pressure on her or making it seem like I’m rushing things? I really like her and want to handle this as respectfully and maturely as possible.

2489,Keeping in touch with exes?,"Am I the only one who doesn’t keep in touch with exes, even if things ended cordially?

I mean, I would say hi to them or be cordial if I bump into them in the street or something like that, but I don’t really see the need to follow them on social media or send the occassional “how you doing” text. In my opinion, once an intimate relationship is over, regardless of circumstances, it is better to close the cycle and move on. Besides, is kind of red flag when entering a new relationship.

2491,Am I doing something wrong that I keep getting ghosted?,"I(25f) have been ok few dates in past year. 

Most of guys will be constantly messaging me and even after the first few dates. But either few will suddenly will ghost me and block me afterwards or their replies start getting slowly like messaging back once a week. 

It really hurts when it keeps on happening constantly. What is it that I’m doing wrong or is wrong with me? I get it if you don’t want to see me anymore. At least have the balls to say that when their the one who push on saying communication is important and complain that how hard it is to date on the apps as a guy. 

It hurts as its making me insecure and I get feelings really quickly. How can I help developing feelings quickly or how can I keep a guy who won’t ghost me cause that’s on my mind now when I do go on dates that this person will stop replying to me so I better not ask how their day has been.",dating
2492,I'm just not interested in anyone...,"My fiancé (44M) and I (44F) broke up after a spectacular fight. It got pretty ugly. He blocked me on everything that day. This was nothing new. He blocked me occasionally for an hour to a couple of days if we were arguing about something because he knew it really got to me. 

It has been 6 months and I am still blocked. I know he still thinks about me, because he has been using pictures from trips we took together. He picked especially romantic places. Two weeks ago he changed it to a new picture of himself, but he looks like a sad puppy. 

Meanwhile, I have been really having a really struggling with losing him. I didn't get out of bed for over a month after the split. I have made progress, worked on myself and grown over the past 6 months, but I'm still just as in love with him and still cry. I have gone on a number of dates and no matter how great the guy is, I just don't have interest. I just want my fiancé.

I'm really wanting to reach out to him and simply say hi, just try to open up a dialogue. Message him something like, ""My dad and I went out for a beer at this bar that reminded me of the place we used to go in Atlanta. Those were good times! How are you doing?"" I would use a new Facebook account so I'm not blocked.

Should I give it one last ditch effort to communicate?",dating
2493,Dating advice for when youre not a pretty girl.,"I’m 21 & I’ve never dated or anything before. I had a lot of anxiety growing up because of my parents but I’ve been working on it throughout college by trying new things, finding hobbies, & understanding my interests. I’m about to graduate & start working & was wondering how to meet people? 

I went to parties in college, but I never have been approached, & guys always seemed super off put whenever I approached them. The orgs I was apart of in college were professional, so I didnt want to flirt with anyone there. Is work the same way? If so, should I resort to going to bars?

In college I also work & lift weights. I’ve had no luck in either of those locations either. I wear a bit of makeup & try to dress well. Yes, both those things can be improved, but my general face & body structures aren’t that great. I am very active with toned arms & legs, but I’m struggling to get rid of stubborn belly fat.

2494,How to meet new people organically,"Hey I have some friends that took my advice and saved up as best they could and bought a project car some bought a collector's car they were interested in and joined car meet groups and kept turning up to each event and just talking about cars thst leads to invites to other social gatherings etc. 

It's a great way to make friends and the best way to meet a girl organically is to go to places where both sexes interact and not just gyms! 

So men have girlfriends who in turn have friends and it's just a long chain-link of people. 

We are all connected you just need to go where people are interacting.. As an example most women are not interested in card game meets so attending those won't help but cars are cool and females love cruising around in them and some like motorbikes too thd upside of bikes is they are really cheap to own and run. 

I hope this helps ❤️",dating

2498,My bestfriend is particularly touchy/flirty with my boyfriend,"My (22F) bestfriend (23F) is particularly touchy/flirty with my boyfriend (24M) and it makes both of us kinda uncomfortable but I don’t know if it’s bad enough to confront her and I don’t want to push her away.

For context, my bestfriend is super introverted and gets very anxious around people unless she is comfortable. Once she is comfortable, she is super fun, bubbly and sweet! I honestly love this girl with all of my heart.

Most of our friend group that she is comfortable with and shows her true self with is female. We can be physical like slap each other’s butts when we compliment each other and give each other hugs and stuff. This never bothered any of us because it’s always platonic and friendly.

However, I recently started dating my boyfriend whom I really like around 6-7 months ago. We were friends of friends in a separate friend group and always hit it off and then started dating. He is super sweet and genuinely cares about other people’s needs and makes them feel comfortable. Overall he feels like a safe space to me and all of my friends and family adore him.

Since he knows how important my bestfriend is to me, he worked hard to make her feel safe and comfortable as well, and eventually she started to come out of her shell. She hasn’t been even this friendly with some of the past boyfriends that she has had before. However, recently I’ve felt that she’s gotten a little too comfortable: slapping his butt, joining us when we are cuddling on the couch, b-lining to say hello to him first, hugging him for a little longer than a regular hug and rubbing his back, trying to sit on his lap, etc. He recently approached me and said that he’s been uncomfortable with her actions and he notices that I subconsciously pull away from him when she does this. He doesn’t want anything to come between us and he told him that I’m his number one priority (which honestly made my heart melt). 

Since he approached me with this, I do want to tell her for the comfort of my boyfriend, however, I see that she genuinely lights up when he’s around and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable around him now. I personally don’t think it’s anything malicious, I think she’s missing the social ques of what is acceptable to do around friends and what is or is not acceptable to your friend’s boyfriend. To be honest, it does make me a bit uncomfortable, but if it was just me I wouldn’t say anything to keep the peace, but since my boyfriend approached me, I don’t think it’s fair to make him also uncomfortable for her sake. I’m really bad at prioritizing myself and I don’t know what to do. Nothing that she’s done is that bad and I really don’t want her to wall up around us or think that we are perceiving her maliciously. 

How can I approaching her and without possibly ruining her friendship with my boyfriend?

Tldr: my bestfriend is touchy/flirty with my boyfriend. I think it’s platonic but he is uncomfortable and I don’t want to make a big deal about it and make her guarded around us.",dating

Anyway some of my co-workers seen us and told me that they know her. Told me stuff like that she goes to bars with one dude and leaves with a different one regularly. Dates multiple guys etc. 

At this point in life I'm having a lot of success and happiness and I don't want to ruin that. Usually I would just let it go and don't risk getting burned. 

But the thing is. I don't feel this from her. Like we've been on a couple dates and to my surprise even though she's obviously into me she's been taking things super slowly. We go for dinner, walk, I walk her home etc. She's seems to be getting more comfortable around me and started like touching me a lot in a romantic way basically like grabbing your hand etc not in a sexual way. And it's surprisingly new to me since I always just went for it and never really waited this long for things to happen haha. It's nice. 

But idk I don't get the feeling that she's the person they described. But then again what if I'm wrong. It's pretty obvious we both want to move forward with this and next time we meet she definitely wants me to kiss her and stuff. But I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings here either now or in the future if it turns out these people were right.

So in my shoes, if you're serious about the woman would you tell her about these rumors? Maybe I'd just let her know I'm okay if she's casually having fun but it's just not what I'm looking for. Idk I could some advice. Thank you.",dating
2501,I broke up with my boyfriend after 5 years,"This is mostly a trauma dump so here we go. Im writing this just to get the story out and to recall the main reasons i decided to breakup with him. I (22F) broke up with my boyfriend (23M) a month ago. I loved my boyfriend unconditionally for about 3.5 years. We went on dates, bought each other meaningful gifts, went on vacations together, etc. To give some context, before we started dating, my boyfriend was a previous drug user and self harmed but went to rehab. I looked past this with the idea that anyone can change if they try hard enough and want to change. His mom and I bickered from time to time but we had a mutual love for each other and over the years I felt that I was accepted as family by her and my boyfriend's sister. My bf was a bit narcissistic and from time to time made sexist comments - again something that I kind of looked past.
We met through mutual friends and the first 6 months was absolutely incredible. We never disagreed on a single thing and already fell in love. Within these 6 months we opened up about our past relationships, especially the trauma from his previous gfs. Within the first year, issues arised with his exes. He admitted that his 2nd ex (we will call ""R"") was a bit of a nut case and has been emailing him trying to get his attention. I shrugged it off and just advised him not to reply (this is important for later). Somewhere in the 6 month - 1 year period I caught him texting his 1st ex (already forgot her name tbh). He was texting her planning to meet and catch up and they were nearly setting. When I read the messages he was drunkenly sleeping after a day skiing the slopes. I woke him up to confront him. He immediately got upset saying ""Why are you going through my phone?"" I replied with ""Why are you texting your ex?"" He tried to explain that he felt remorse and needed closure from how they left off. I responded saying that if he continues to text her we are over. He calmed down and began to apologize to me begging me to stay. This should have been red flag #1 but I shrugged it off. Everything was going pretty smoothly after this incident until about 6 months to a year later. I caught him messaging R. Same as he was with ex #1. This time I decided not to confront to see if he would continue. To my then relief, he stopped speaking to her on his own within the same week I found the messages. I tried to keep it to myself for as long as I could but I couldn't hold out any longer after some months and admitted to him that I read his.messages and how this hurt me. He explained that he loved me and that's why he stopped and never wanted to hurt me like that again.
Flash forward about another year. We began to disagree on some things and he relapsed a few times which caused rifts in our relationship. We would argue over his drug and alcohol abuse every few months. At some point in this time he was gifted a car by his family for his birthday. He then proceeded to get black out drunk after his p.m. classes and totalled his car by hit and running someone ahead of him at an intersection. Many months following the incident, he always laughed it off saying it was just a stupid accident. I always got upset at thus because it could have been so much worse and he could have genuinely hurt someone. Luckily for him, he was never caught and no one was injured. This incident did not stop him from continuing to get wasted and he would commonly get drunk by himself in his room. Throughout our relationship he lived with his mom and sister. There have been many instances where he would get drunk and belligerent. He's sacred his mom and sister on a number of accounts. One day during spring/summer my bf, I, and 2 of his friends were hanging out in his room drinking a bit. I must note now, that I have not and do not to this day enjoy drinking much as I tend to get anxiety from being out of control of my own body and surroundings - I especially did not enjoy drinking with my bf because I did not feel like I had someone who would keep me safe and had a feeling he was a danger to me. The 3 guys managed to down nearly 1.5 bottles of wine each which caused my bf to get blackout drunk. By the end of the night, his 2 friends decided to go home and he wanted to lead them down the steps to the front door of the building to say goodbye. His mom was against this and told him to just say goodbye at the top of the steps before he manages to fall down the stairs and break his neck. He told her to ""fuck off I'm a grown man"" and went down. At this point, she was already tired of his shit and ran down after him. They got into a heated verbal exchange when she slapped him and he forcefully slapped her back. He then ran off a couple blocks away which I then stupidly decided to go looking for him with his friend who lived nearby. We eventually found him and brought him to his dad who then just shrugged it off. This should have been red flag #2 because of what happened I believe to be the following summer. On his mom's birthday, we celebrated at his dad's and step-mom's house and then walked back to his mom's house which was just a few blocks away. At the celebration he, as usual, drank too much and blacked out. His dad was also and alcoholic who would push my bf to drink with him at events like this. While walking back to his mom's house, he wanted to go buy weed from his friend nearby which I told him was a bad idea because he was already shitfaced and didn't need anything more. When we got back to his house, we got into a heated argument and he began calling me all sorts of names. I proceeded to slap him when he got up, grabbed my throat, and threw me on the bed and began choking me. He laid over me, choking me until a ran out of air and flailing my arms trying to get a hit in. He finally released my throat and continued to belligerntly call me names and threaten me. I wanted to go home but his mom begged me to stay as I was crying and told me I can sleep in her bed and she sleep on the couch. Hesitantly I agreed and a night of agony ensued when he kept trying to wake me up to apologize. Later that morning I forgave him and decided to just move on. I began to blame myself for hitting him first - if I wouldn't have hit him first maybe he would've never hurt me yada yada. After some time things have died down and we eventually went on a vacation together with 2 of my friends and had a pretty good time. 
After the last incident though I began feeling less attracted to him and our sex life began to crumble a bit. He began to argue with me every time I refused having sex with him and would get verbally aggressive. Sometimes when I was adimant that I did not want to have sex, we just force my clothes off and have his way. I eventually started to just give in and just let him have his way so I wouldn't have to deal with the constant nagging from him or potentially just forcing me.
Last summer the final red flag hit. This is a good time to remember his previous messages with ex #2 or 'R'. We had tickets to go to a music festival with some friends. I bought the tickets so that morning I was helping him set up his wristband for that day. I needed his phone in order to access his emails so I could get the link for setting up his wristband. The first email I see when I open the app is an email from R and his response. She emailed asking how he is doing and how she would like to catch up and that she missed him. I already can't remember what his response was but when he saw that I saw the email exchange he immediately apologized but said that he still felt bad with the way they left off and wanted some closure. I decided I didn't want this to ruin my day as I've already prepaid nearly $300 per ticket for the festival. We continued on with our day and had a great time at the music festival.
I look back now realizing how many opportunities I had to break up with him for good reason. Since last year I have began to consider breaking up with him. My own sister (36M) and other relatives (even his own mom!) began telling me that I should consider breaking up with him. I took their suggestions seriously but ended up kind of shrugging it off. The last few months, my sister began to really try to press that I should break up with him already. (Side note: I love my sister and have always looked up to her so I always appreciated her suggestions and opinions) I have been looking for the right time to break up with him now. I kept thinking that the day will come, the perfect day. I kept being told that it will never come and I just need to rip the bandaid off. At this point I have also become a bit distant with him and wouldn't cone over as often (I would typically sleep over almost every weekend and come over throughout the week). Last month on a Sunday I came over after being at my sisters house. He wanted to have sex so as usual I just let him have his way to avoid any nagging. It was at this point - my breaking point - that I decided that I will never do this again. I will never let him force me into sex again. I will never let him put his hands on me again. I will never argue with him about his drug and alcohol abuse again. The following day, Monday, it came - the perfect time I was looking for. I ended work at 5p.m. and I knee he would be ending work at around the same time but he would be home later as he worked much farther. At work, I pumped myself up telling myself that I have to do it, just do it. So I did. I went to his house around 5:30 that day. I told his mom and sister what I was about to do although shocked they understood completely. We had our hungs, talked our shit about him, and said our farewells. When he came home I finally did it. With tears in my eyes and a stutter I explained to him that I want to break up and why. ""I just don't love you the same anymore - I love you as an endearing friend and not a significant other"" He put up a fight trying to talk it out but eventually he let me leave. I already took my things before he even got home. I ran to my car and cried because the last 5 years are over. All the bad memories gone... and the good ones too.
A month later I am happy to say that I am doing well for myself and have enjoyed spending more time with my sister and my friends. The weight is off my shoulders. I recently found out that he now applied to a trade school so he could become an electrician and started running again. Although it hurts to know that he decided to start doing the things he said he was gonna do years ago but always put off now that we have broken up. It seems that this break up may have been good for the both of us. Maybe now he can start heading in the right direction and I can find love for myself after everything that's happened in the past 5 years. I still deeply care about him and hope he does well for himself. And I hope I can eventually find myself a motorcycle riding, car loving (like me) man of my dreams.",dating
2502,How can I [F 21] get more successful dates as an unattractive woman?,"Okay, I started dating again after ending a FWBs. And I started with dating apps. I get matches, but they go nowhere. I try to have fun openers and initiate conversations, but rarely do I get a response. It's even rarer that turns into a date. When it does, I usually get one or two dates. And from those dates I'm given the cold shoulder or in a last ditch effort the guy just tries to sleep with me.

&#x200B;

In real life, I'm virtually never approached. I've been catcalled, but that's it. Men leave me alone. I live in a very populated, big city and I've never even had a guy buy me a drink.

 I wouldn't mind approaching men, but I'm not a pretty girl. It also doesn't help I am a minority at a PWI. I've been doing what I can. I try to stay fit (though according to the BMI scale, I am about 5 lbs from being overweight). I'm taking care of my problem prone skin. I try to dress well and make sure my hair is done (it's a struggle), but I'm still not pretty or conventionally attractive. I look goofy for lack of a better word. 

I hear all the time guys would feel flattered about a woman approaching them ,but I'm not so sure. Would they really feel that way about a not so cute girl coming up to them. I'm afraid they would be insulted.

&#x200B;

I'm also open to meeting people through hobbies (I bake, garden, roller skate, do roller derby, etc), but many of my hobbies are solo. So it's just kind of more difficult.

Is there anything else I can do? I considered also updating my dating app pictures, but I'm not photogenic. help lol",dating
2503,What is up with blocking culture currently?,"I’m single in the dating game and have noticed anytime someone loses interest they just block you instead of actually communicating anything.

Even this week I had someone pursue me , take my number , hung out with them for a bit and had a great time (yes it was fun for both , no I’m not delusional). And then they just blocked me out of nowhere when they pursued me and were actively texting me.  Is this normal now, or what happened to actual communication “hey I’m not interested for xyz reason , thank you though”.

Has social media just killed basic human courtesies even when you are communicating on people’s personal cell’s? We say “excuse me , thank you, bye” etc as basic courtesy to each other in real life and I just think ghosting falls in this category of lacking basic human courtesy unless the person is a creepy stalker.",dating

2506,"Is it normal for a couple to insult each other with ""dumb"", ""stupid"", ""crazy"" etc... recall it as a sign of last longer relationship? or just positive toxicity?","Well, it's my girl-friend and her boyfriend's situation. Their relationship is private, probably made up of mutual agreement; she never actually showed her boyfriends or pictures of them together on Facebook or Instagram, but they frequently share and comment on each other's posts. Also, their relationship statuses are both hidden—yep, just for their privacy—but the way they insulted each other....  
making me question. They always insulted each other: ""dumb "", ""stupid"", ""crazy,"" etc. For me personally, I find it offensive. For example, if her boyfriend comments on her post, she will reply with disrespectful words such as ""stupid, nobody thinks like that, etc."" The same goes for the boyfriend; maybe they've known each other long enough? Or perhaps it's just playful teasing? This is so mentally draining in my opinion, or else I'm just overthinking; maybe this is a sign of a longer relationship since they do not offend each other?",dating

2508,What’s the shortest amount of time it has taken you to recover from a breakup?,"Maybe you were thinking about it for a while, maybe it was just toxic and you quickly learned that you were better outside of the relationship, I’m curious to know what was the shortest time and why!",dating
2509,Relationship justice has been served to me lol,"Anyone else been a weirdo with a crush/s.o. before? I had a dear female friend for a few years. I was obsessed with her, her friendship was my favorite thing life had to offer me by far. I couldn’t help it. In some ways she felt like the first girl that let me in, the first girl that talked to me. And she was pretty. Lol. It felt good. But I was too much. I was ridiculously needy. Eventually, after 4 years of being close friends, and some questionable/confusing romantic vibes at times, she suddenly disappeared.

Basically I reacted badly after she lied extremely badly after sending me a mistext that possibly was directed towards a lover though I’ll never really be sure what it was exactly. She had a distance boyfriend that things were getting hairy with and was giving me confusing amounts of attention around the same time. Anyway things got weird for a bit after that weird mistext situation. Then things seemed to get better, maybe even flirting with romantic. Then she disappeared. I didn’t respond very well to her disappearing. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Eventually I deleted her number, all our texts, all contact with her. I felt awful for being so obsessed but I also was so incredibly hurt she pulled it on me like that. Adios she said. No not even that. It didn’t hurt as bad a year later. Guess I was a weirdo.

Then I got a girlfriend. This time she was the one obsessed with me. I thought she was sweet. She wasn’t 100% my type but she grew on me and I felt like it worked okay. I didn’t feel like I needed a whole lot from her but it was nice having her there. And she absolutely adored me. But she had a few issues. I was surprisingly good about keeping things grounded in the main but sometimes her insecurities really came out. She reminded me of me.

She might have locked up enough now to have given me the slip idk. She has some drug issues and she’s trying to make some positive changes but she’s really high strung right now. And it’s easy for people to go from all good to all bad with her I think. Anyway things have been a little on edge as she’s been withdrawing. I was on the phone with my parents, catching up, having a great conversation (they are about 11hrs away). She called while I was talking to them. It took a bit but I wrapped up the conversation with them. Then I called her back. She didn’t pick up. Texted her. No response. Texted her again if she wanted to talk, no response. She’s been making some bizarre assumptions lately, assuming the worst. Feel like she might be thinking of me as all bad. Idk.

We were supposed to go on a date tomorrow. If I don’t hear from her by the end of tomorrow, I’m kinda thinking right now maybe I’ll just let it be over if that’s where she takes it. This is a bit much. Justice served to me, time to move on",dating

2511,Confused why he (29m) is now hurt when I (26f) feel like I’m respecting his boundaries,"
For context: I (26f) was dating a man (29m) I met through a friend for about 2 months. Naturally the “where is this going” conversation came up. I stated I wanted a relationship but needed more intimacy. He responded that he’s not mentally or emotionally able to invest in a relationship right now. Stung but at least I was able to cut my loses before I was too emotionally invested. I took a few days to sort through things and honestly have a few good cries since this was the first man I dated since my last relationship 2 years ago. I got back in touch a few days ago to just check in and clear the air (yeah I’m upset but if he can’t give more then it is what it is). I’ve been polite but reserved if anything. I’m not responding the second his messages come through or initiating conversation like I was when we were dating. 

Which brings us to the present. He’s upset because he feels that I’m not “putting in effort to maintain our friendship.” I told him I’m busy having just started a new job and that we’re not friends, we’re acquaintances at best since we only have known each other for two months (plus I see my friends almost everyday, I saw him maybe once a week). I also told him I was respecting his needs by not pressuring him into a friendship or anything else since he said he didn’t have the capacity. 

Obviously only he can tell me exactly why he’s upset but I’m confused. Why expect the same amount of attention and effort that would go into a relationship when you’ve explicitly said you don’t want a relationship right now? I would maybe be able to be his friend but he doesn’t even put the in the effort I would expect from my friends.",dating

For some background. I’ve never had a relationship or have ever been on a date. I’ve had some bad experiences with admitting my feelings and getting rejected and being sad about it. However, with a lot of time working on myself (still am), I feel like I’m ready to take a dive into the world of dating.

My mom died when I was very young and I never had a woman in my life to tell me she loves me.

2515,Dating apps are a black hole.,"Lately I’ve been finding myself frustrated at the fact that dating apps have now become the main substitute for literal human interaction. It’s like interacting with people in reality has become so taboo and unfamiliar when literally that’s how you’re SUPPOSED to form relationships. Like, if I were to approach someone on the street and say hi, id get a “hi?” Back as opposed to a “hello!” As if it’s absolutely abnormal to walk up to someone on the street and try to make a new friend/connection. A swipe on someone’s profile doesn’t mean you wanna get to know someone. It means you wanna ask a few questions. And if that person isn’t what you’re expecting in your head right away, finding someone else who might or might not be a little closer to your ideal partner. It seems like Sex appeal has now become the prioritized element of a person and people who don’t meet the standard, are often being overlooked and ignored because they don’t look like Channing Tatum. And if you do meet the standard, the chances of finding someone who’s gonna actually appreciate you, love you, and care for you besides wanting sex. Is pretty slim. I just want to know why it is that we’ve become so shy from one another all of a sudden? It’s As if we aren’t from the same human race anymore. We can’t trust anyone in their physical form. But as long as it’s over the phone it’s ok. I really don’t get it. This substitution for human interaction is creating an even bigger divide than we even know.",dating

2517,Should you do online dating if you are a man?,"The answer is simple. Don't do online dating if you are a straight male. Stick to offline only. 

Have you ever watched a woman on a dating app? It's very enlightening. A bang-average looking female that you wouldn't look twice at in the street, with a bang-average personality, little sense of humour and a badly written profile, will get 100s of likes, massively higher than a very good looking man with a great profile. And she will instantly reject 95% of them. She'll date a tiny number of the tallest and best looking ones and because most men are happy to lower their standards for short-term relationships, but not for longer-term ones, those men will date her for a while but will rarely stick around. The woman then ends up unhappy and blames it all on men for being ""commitment-phobes"" or some other imaginary rubbish that flatters her ego by avoiding recognition of her own failings and poor choices. The masses of rejected men end up unhappy too for obvious reasons, while the best looking 1% of men go around having sex with everything in sight. 

Studies of online dating repeatedly show that if you give women lots of men to choose from, they will mostly choose the same small number of good looking ones and ignore the rest, even if the woman is unattractive herself. While on the other hand, men tend to like anyone who doesn't look like Jabba the Hut's inbred cousin. Studies of speed-dating also show that women are, on average, more likely than men to decide if they're going to tick someone, before that person sits down and speaks. The age-old myth of men being the more shallow gender has been completely shattered - not that many men believed it anyway. 

And why would this whole situation be different anyway? Dating apps aren't designed to create couples. That's the worst thing that can happen to their revenue. Rather they are designed to make money from people who are NOT in couples and the longer they stay that way, the greater the profit.

Just when you thought that this situation couldn't be worse, if you ever discuss these self-evident truths, you end up getting called a misogynist or some childish garbage about being bitter. I'm not saying that all women are like this, but the ones that aren't don't need to do online dating, as they will always easily find someone. Attracting a man online is about as difficult as tying your own shoelaces so a female can only fail by being delusional and believing she's too good for the 99%.",dating

2521,Is it unreasonable for me (M/18) to expect my girlfriend (F18) to tell me when she texts this particular guy?,"My gf and I have been going out for a bit over a year. We were out late last year where we meet another guy about my age, call him 'B'. So B and I actually got along quite well, meanwhile my GF and B hardly talked. Since this night, B has seen neither my GF or me. However, we all exchanged socials. A couple weeks after that night I noticed on my GFs phone that they had been texting, a lot. I found this odd and I did get a bit jealous. I trust my GF so I wasn't worried on that end, more the fact that she didn't tell me about how they were texting. Anyway, I brought this up with her and she agreed and was very apologetic. They stopped texting, not because I told her too - i was fine with that as long as she communicated with me about it - but because their conversation was dying out anyway. This was around December.  
However, today I was with my GF while she was on Instagram. There was a message and I noticed that she avoided opening it. She closed insta and I said why didn't you open the message. She said because it's nothing. Obviously that sounded suspicious, which I mentioned, so then she went back in to open the message. It wasn't from B, but by opening her DMs she revealed that B and them had been texting again in February, a fair amount too. She showed me the texts, and they were fine, very friendly and not very flirty. What really bothered me is that she hid it from me, even after I had already discussed this with her. Not only was she trying to hid her messages but she didn't mention at all to me in February that they had been texting again. I felt like she betrayed my trust and it really hurt. Like the first time, she agreed, and was apologetic.However, now im wondering whether I am over reacting. Is this fair from my behalf?  
TL;DR my GF starting texted a guy without telling me, I found out accidentally and I said it made me uncomfortable. She agreed and was sorry she didn't tell me. A couple months later, they started texting again, and like the first time, she didn't tell me. I felt betrayed. Am I in the wrong?",dating

Also on their profile they said their relationship goals are new friends, but also that they're not looking for anything specific, and are open to exploring under relationship type.
I was wondering if it would be weird or off-putting to message them something along the lines of ""hey, I was wondering if you'd want to catch up and hang out sometime. If I'm being totally honest I have a bit of a crush on you but I'm also not looking for a relationship right now. If you're not interested in that right now I totally understand, and if you'd just like to hang out as friends instead I'm also very happy with that :)""",dating
2523,Top 10 Lessons in Dating to My Younger Self,"After commenting elsewhere and posting on my blog (link in bio), I have been messaged about some advice on dating for men. I thought the best way to express this is through what I would've have taught myself back when I needed guidance on the fairer sex.

Admittedly, it's more centred towards men (although some points apply to women) so sorry if it's not useful for you ladies, although I would love to hear your opinions on these points.

**Top 10 Lessons in Dating To My Younger Self**

Growing up is a challenging game for some guys. We go through a wealth of information, sometimes conflicting, and find it even more confusing to understand women after taking in that information.

I was undoubtedly one of those guys who had no idea what I was doing. I couldn’t attract a girl in school to save my life. I was everyone’s best friend and no one's crush.

With time I learned to let loose and have a more ‘fuck it’ mentality. With some great role models and mentors, the chains of being unattractive came off and I’ve gone on to have some wild and wonderful experiences with women. I’ve perhaps learned most by coaching other men through their struggles with women.

I learned most of these lessons through taking action, so I implore you to get off the phone and go into the wide world full of wonders and practice after reading this.

So here are the top 10 pieces of advice I would have given to my younger self who was lost, confused, and somewhat delusional about how to attract women. Now enough about me and into the lessons. It’s written like a blog post because it is an excerpt from my blog (I get downtime moments while traveling and had many clients ask me about my experiences so decided to make a blog).

&#x200B;

**You can’t attract women if you’re not around them**

With most men I advise, the first question I ask is how many women do you meet on a monthly basis?

I usually come to find out that they stay at home or work and don’t expose themselves to environments where they can meet women.

Modern technology has made meeting women a much easier process, adding digital environments (dating apps) to physical ones. If you want to meet women it’s best to expose yourself as much as possible.

Get on dating apps, find socials and meet-ups to go to. Rather than just ‘hang out’ with your friends, go to bars and experience night life together. There are apps such as Meetup where you can expand on your hobbies and interests as well as meeting women (who will likely share more commonalities with you).

&#x200B;

**You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take**

This was made famous by hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. When asked how he comes to score so many goals he said “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”, which is absolutely true.

This is one of the best pieces of advice I ever received not just for dating, but life in general. Any salesperson will tell you that those who reach out to potential clients the most are usually those who generate the most business, and it’s the same for women.

I’ve had multiple one-night stands, a few threesomes, relationships, and business deals which started just by saying hi to someone.

When you open any new interaction, you have no idea where it will go. Eventually, some of them will go well even if it’s through sheer persistence and probability. When you start out, it can be a numbers game at times. If you can get past the fear of rejection and just say ‘hello’ you will create new connections which will surprise the most optimistic version of yourself.

When I initially got to know some of the classic pick-up artists (through clubbing) who brought me on, I would have to approach 30-50 women to get a good response. As I improved over time, that number came down to 3-4 approaches and eventually 1-2 as I improved. That takes me on to the next point.

&#x200B;

**Just say ‘hi’, the rest will work itself out through time**

Other questions I commonly get asked are ‘What’s the perfect thing to say?’ and ‘What should I do when…’

If you’re just starting out then the only thing on your mind I would recommend is putting yourself out there. Just go and say ‘hi’ and see what happens. The rest of the interaction will initially guide itself, whether positive or negative.

By overloading your mind with information it does 2 things. Firstly, it makes you less likely to approach because you become filled with so many questions that you stand there motionless while an opportunity begins to fade. Secondly, it creates an awkward interaction because there are infinite responses she could have, which throws your current plan out the window.

With time and experience, you will develop wit which will guide you through any situation. With that being said, you already have certain tools to take interactions forward, you just don’t know it.

I’ve worked with guys who have autism, dyslexia, stutters and other mental disorders. With most, it just turned out they weren’t actually exposed to women or approaching them which was the bulk of the problem.

&#x200B;

**Your mind will adapt to success and failure**

As mentioned above, you won’t turn into a casanova overnight. The more interactions you have, the more successes and failures you will overcome.

The brain is a wonderful thing in that it hates failure. Sigmund Freud, the granddaddy of modern psychiatry said we do things for two main reasons. For sexual desire and to feel important. Approaching women attacks both aspects.

Those emotions of not feeling wanted, being unattractive and hopelessness that arise when you get a negative response is because your brain hates failure, trying to get you to avoid the experience again. It latches on to negative behaviors (some subconscious) that you won’t repeat when faced with the same situation again.

This works on the flipside with success. When you succeed in an interaction (have a good conversation, number, kiss, sex, relationship etc) it fills you with the happy hormone, dopamine. It subconsciously aligns you to repeat those positive behaviors again.

With time and enough calibration, those successful behaviors become ingrained. When I go out now I don’t think about how I need to approach any scenario. With all the years of approaching and dating my brain has subconsciously aligned itself to what has succeeded for me. It can’t do this if you don’t go out there and expose it to these experiences which goes back to points 1 and 2.

&#x200B;

**You are your environment, surround yourself with like-minded people**

In this case, it’s surrounding yourself with those who are open to meeting women. A gripe that a lot of men also come to me with is “My friends are also too afraid to approach women” or “They’re boring and don’t want to go out”

If you surround yourself with people on the same path as you (in this case meeting women) you’ll find all aspects of attraction much easier. This is because other guys looking to improve their relationships will have the same thoughts, worries, and goals as you.

I was lucky enough to meet people at different stages of my life who taught me lessons in attraction and a big part of that was me making the effort to get close to their environments (which also became mine).

At a young age, I had a cousin who was fearless in all walks of life. He was the type of guy who just naturally did not give a shit. When we’d hang out I’d watch him shamelessly approach women on the street, sometimes with the worst possible lines and still manage to have a satisfying romantic life.

Growing older, I began to hang out with guys who would want to go out to bars and clubs while openly approaching women. Each bad approach was met with a laugh from the group and more encouragement. This is ultimately how I began to improve and eventually randomly get asked by a well-known ‘pick-up artist’ to join his company (as he had the biggest club promoting company as well).

I wouldn’t be as happy as I am today with my dating life If I hadn’t exposed and aligned myself with these people who I took aspects of in my own life.

&#x200B;

**You improve most through failure much more so than success so learn to enjoy it**

Initially, when you get out there, failure is the biggest fear. It hits like a sledgehammer. However, without you realizing it becomes your best friend.

If we didn’t have failures, we wouldn’t know what to improve on. Once you understand that failure is your best path to success, you treat each interaction as a learning point.

Bill Gates famously said “It’s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.” Which is absolutely true for all walks of life.

Next time an approach, date or interaction goes badly ask yourself ‘What can I learn from this?’ rather than self-destructive thoughts such as ‘Why am I so bad at this?’ and ‘I will never succeed’. Trust me, with enough practice, you will get there.

&#x200B;

**Fake it till you make it but be honest about it**

This one’s an interesting one. You read the information online, take advice from who you can, and go out into the big bad dating world. You know full well you have limited experience with women but you’re going try anyway.

By approaching and interacting with women you’re essentially faking confidence which you don’t initially have and that’s absolutely fine. It’s different from lying.

When I first went out and got some small successes, I would open up to women about my lack of experience. However, when I began to do this in a more confident manner, as the hit of rejection gets easier with each approach and interaction, my responses started to improve exponentially.

With time, that confidence will go from fake to genuine and you will build up enough experience which will show in your energy.

I was watching a documentary about one of the biggest Latin stars, J Balvin. He spoke about how he went to Miami and took on a persona of a reggaeton star despite being completely unknown. They all thought he was crazy. Ultimately, he went on to become just that.

&#x200B;

**Express your desires**

During our younger years, we get taught various social rules, some of which go on to restrict us later in life. One of these is to be respectful and not say anything rude. While true, it has the unintended effect of making us afraid to express our desires to women.

We worry how it will come across and how we’ll get shunned by her and society for doing so, while the opposite is true. We then go on to treat women we’re attracted to like friends in the hope that one day they’ll magically realize how attractive we are.

The truth is, if you want to attract women, you’ll have to express your desire for them in one way or another. This can be through words and non-verbal (eye contact, body language etc) means. Only then will you create an atmosphere of romantic/sexual tension in your interactions.

This can be met in different ways. Once you’re confident enough in your own self-image, it almost always comes across well. Even when it doesn’t get a good response, you can say ‘all good’ and move on with your life. This takes me on to the next point.

&#x200B;

**It’s mostly not what you say, it’s how you say it**

When starting out on my ‘being an attractive man’ journey, I would wonder what the perfect thing to say is. It definitely does affect interactions, but not half as much as how you say it.

By this I mean a few things such as:

Body language: Things come across as completely different when you say it slouched, looking down and with folded arms than if you stand straight, looking directly at the recipient with open body language. The latter is better.

Eye contact: This can be more nuanced. You want to hold eye contact for longer but not enough to be considered a stare. In general life, we hold minimal eye contact with most people and this is what women are also used to. Hold eye contact for 30-40% more than you would with non-romantic people in your life. Think about how you felt when a girl held eye contact with you for longer. It just created feelings you wouldn’t otherwise have.

Tonality: Another lesson from the sales mantra is your tonality makes a difference. When speaking, having a positive and consistent tone makes a big difference. Some guys I work with tend to end all their sentences with a question. Why? Because their subconscious fear of rejection wants to make everything sound more diplomatic. Think about the tonality you use with someone you consider to be on your level (usually friends and family). It comes across as more assured and authoritative.

Pitch: One blessing I have had genetically is a deep voice. It’s the thing I get most complimented on. Generally for men, the deeper the voice, the more attractive it comes across. The best part is you can work on having a deeper pitch. Actors and singers do this all the time.

&#x200B;

**Go traveling, it will open your mind to new ways of thinking**

As much as I learned about attracting women through role models and practice, I have also come to meet some amazing women (and people) while traveling who taught me new ways of thinking.

Traveling opens you to different forms of communication and perspectives on dating (and life) across the world.

For example, in Brazil, the women openly come up to you and tell you they find you hot, a phenomenon which is rarer in London or San Francisco.

It doesn't have to be expensive. When you travel, book a bed or room in a hostel and get involved in social activities. Everyone is there to meet people so it's much easier to mingle. You also make friends for life! Traveling alone can seem daunting until you realize many other people in hostels and world cities are also traveling alone looking to meet new people.

I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I hadn’t visited over 50 countries, had some once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and dated women from all forms of life. It just makes you a more interesting and complete person.

If you don’t know how to plan or book there are endless companies easily found on Google that will book tours for you at reasonable prices. They will remove most of the stress which comes with planning activities and socials.

Hope this is useful. Feel free to comment/DM if you have any questions or check out my blog (link in bio) for more advice and stories of my past experiences meeting women.

2526,"Can't get passed first date stage, any advice?","I've gone on 20-30 first dates over the past years or so, and not had a single one has wanted to meet up again.

I'm not repellant. I'm not a model by no means but fairly OK looking. I make an effort to dress nice, and I am always the one to organise it.  I think of a lot of different questions to ask so we can have a more engaging date. I throw in a few compliments to show that I am attracted to her, tell her a few funny stories to make laugh, and always give a hug on arrival and goodbye.

However 2 scenarios seem to happen:

A) The lady ends up talking at me, not to me. She talks for ages about work situations and I struggle to find an opportunity to add my thoughts. I begin to get overwhelmed and find it hard to maintain attention.  I feel bored as I get the impression she doesn't want to get to know me and just wants to chat aimlessly. When I watch shows like First Dates, I enjoy the back and forth chat the daters have, as well as the banter and more relaxed vibes as they take it slowly with interactions. It doesn't seem to happen in real life.

B) The date actually appears to go well. We have some good questions, good eye contact, the conversation is balanced. We talk about a wide variety of stuff and there doesn't appear to be any awkward silences. I give her a hug goodbye, but she keeps her distance away after so there's not proximity for a kiss!

Afterwards, I get either ghosted (which is really upsetting) or I get told there's no chemistry, click or spark.  I really don't know where to find this missing element. I get no feedback besides this so I can't improve for the next time. I don't say anything lewd, weird or offensive. My friends can't understand why I have no luck with women - maybe they are just being nice! Personally I find spark isn't a straight away thing but grows after a few dates

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I tend to use the apps, and I find the process of matching, talking, organising, preparing and doing the date really strenuous and heartbreaking when I might get deleted straight after. I just want the chance to have a second date at least once.",dating
2527,I’m (20f) scared to lose my virginity does this mean I should wait til marriage?,"I’m a believer in god, raised Catholic but more so culturally. I was never a strict follower and barely even attend church. Growing up I had a lot of issues with feeling forced into faith by my parents which initially made me reject it until Covid happened and the faith became my own. 

I’m now dating a wonderful guy I met on Hinge who I’ve known for 2mths and dated for almost 2 (1 month + 3 weeks lool). He wouldn’t want to be celibate and isn’t religious, which I don’t mind but I guess my fear is that the act of sex is vulnerable. I know were dating so it’s not the same as a hookup with a stranger but the the thought of being intimate and falling in love just for it to end (not by me) and then having to start again scares the hell out of me. But I can’t just be like… I’ll only sleep with you if I know you’re my future husband.

I get it… something is wrong with me. And I don’t think my feelings necessarily have anything to do with faith. 

The pedestalisation of female virginity by cohorts of men in wider society has most likely also got to my head. And I’m very disappointed about that, but don’t know what to do! I’m really attracted to him and feel the desire but my head always says no.",dating

If I was hot these women would probably be way more quicker to respond. They'd be asking questions about me and messaging me first too. God I bet it would be amazing.

I'd be looking for a girl who'd accept those interests and preferably shares them as well. I think it would be better that girls see that and know it wouldn't work out right away than me reveal that later and they be like ""ew"".

What else would be a good idea to be upfront about? Height? Political orientation? I even saw when my friend was using Tinder that there is an option to add vax status.

He had his original age on there before (I've seen his ID) but just changed it to 3 years younger. I don't know how to feel about him faking his age. Is this a red flag? Is he trying to match younger women? I'm trying to look out for myself before things get serious.

However, she hasn’t reached out to let me know when she wants to hang out. We haven’t texted much between the last meeting so I have a feeling she’s pursuing other options and just putting me on the back burner but I’m not sure.

2539,Should I (22f) not make the first move on my crush given my living situation?,"I have very little experience in dating (only one short-lived boyfriend in high school and have yet to lose my v card) and have a boatload of insecurities I work hard to overcome, but the biggest one by far right now is the fact that I still live with my strict, and slightly overly involved parents. Our financial situation has made it so that I don’t own my own car, so I have no way of getting around on my own. I am also still in college and my parents are very against the idea of me having a job in fear of it distracting me from my studies. They’re also the kind of parents to send me a lot of texts whenever I’m out asking where I am, who I’m with, and where I’m going next, even at my age. 

I just feel like I’m not bringing a whole lot to the table right now except potential complications, and given the fact that this guy is quite popular and has a lot of attractive, successful women in his social/professional circles, I have to wonder if making the first move is a bit ambitious. He did show some pretty clear indicators of interest in me early this year but never asked me out, and sadly at the time I was so anxious and couldn’t believe he’d be interested in me so I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. 

There’s a chance he’s moved on by now but I’ve been wanting to take more initiative in my life — I just don’t know if this is a good place to start.

TLDR: I finally got some courage to ask my crush to hang out eventually but don’t have any transportation or financial independence on top of living with strict parents who don’t want me to work for the time being.

2540,I Allowed Modern Dating Habits To Ruin Me.,"I (26m) just called off a third date and potential relationship with a good woman (51f). It's not the first time I've done this either. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's that I'm afraid of getting hurt again myself, afraid of using the other person like an object for physical pleasure, don't feel like I'm in a good mindset to form a relationship, or maybe I just like the chase and feeling of finding a new potential partner. My longest relationship was just under a year, but most of my relationships last maybe two weeks to a month on average. All of them have been ended by me. I've never cheated, so I guess there's at least something going for me. I tend to blame online dating apps, like tinder, for molding me into the way I am with relationships and dating. Swipe all day, get a match, date for a couple weeks, rinse, and repeat. I hate it. Developing feelings for someone one day, then the next I can't imagine spending another minute with them and that feeling persists regarding that person. It doesn't matter if I ghost the other person or I tell them straight up how I feel, I still feel like a terrible person. Genuinely, I think I'm done with dating as it is. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm just another douchebag. Any way you want to cut it, I think it's best to just focus on me for a while.

2541,I messed up with my hubby,"Brook up with my first boyfriend

he's 30 and he happens to be my first boyfriend since I came to the USA at 23. Let me tell you, even though we've only been together for two months, they've been the absolute best. He's got it all - brains, looks, an amazing laugh, and a smile that just melts my heart. Plus, he's a total romantic.

Here's how it all went down. It started as a random hookup, you know? I spent 2 hours with him and then, being a bit clueless about the whole dating and hookup thing, I got him a drink the next day. We ended up making out for half an hour, and that became a regular thing. But then, out of the blue, he took me on a beach date. That's when I realized I should've mentioned that I'm only sticking around for four months before leaving the USA. I honestly didn't realize how much he was into me.

Yesterday, I finally broke the news to him about my upcoming departure. he was shocked and super sad. I cried my eyes out for three whole hours, and while trying to cheer me up, he couldn't hide his own tears. So, I decided to spend the entire day with him and even had my first sleepover. The guy admitted that I'm the first person who's ever treated him right and that I'm actually his first real relationship( he is chubby and introverted). He even proudly showed my pictures to his family and deleted all his hookup apps and pics. Every time he mentioned these things, I couldn't help but cry. I feel so guilty for making him open up to me and then dropping this bomb on him.

He also shared this beautiful dream he had of growing old together, getting a dog, and living happily ever after. Honestly, I've had those same thoughts too. And then he whispered how being alone with his thoughts is the worst feeling for him. It hit me hard, especially since he's had a tough battle with depression in the past.

I'm still sad knowing that I only have two months left with him. I can't decide if staying with him will make it even harder to leave or if it's worth it to enjoy every moment we have together.",dating
2542,I am a virgin (asian) and moving to the US soon. Curious how it might be perceived through dating POV?,"Ugh super nervous. 😅 I'm curious about this:
Do/ will American (western) guys find it weird? Or is it seen like a negative thing there? How is this perceived, dating-wise?

I'm (F30) moving to the US for a really long term assignment and there's a possibility of maybe eventually deciding to pursue citizenship since my visa allows that option/ work demands it. So yes, I am open to dating there and I do understand that the cultural difference is massive especially in dating. So I'm curious and honestly a bit worried whoever I date might find me weird when they learn of this about me, or might be an issue later (e.g. maybe not be able to maintain that aspect of the relationship well because I lack the sexual experience.)
(Btw, in my native country- I think this is relatively common/acceptable)

Some background about me: I haven't had sex by choice. I'm not sure if I could be called a prude, but I grew up in a standard asian family (a bit conservative I guess) and I guess chastity is one of the values/ things I really stuck with until I was in Uni (following parents' rules, while living with them). In my 20s- I consider myself generally open-minded especially I have been educated in pretty liberal schools and worked in multinational companies, plus of course, I had past relationships as well. I developed my own set of views about it and values outside of my upbringing. It's just that I never got to a point where I was comfortable/ felt safe to be that intimate with anyone in the past. It was just a personal choice that I really want to feel certainty, safety and comfort to bare that much to another human being. I think that it could be fun and a learning experience if I take this thing less seriously, but for some reasons it just personally really felt that if someone would get that close to me- it should be with someone I really love and trust and understands it somehow? 😅 I'm sorry I'm not sure if I'm making sense or if I'm explaining it well. Just that it is what it is now. 

It's not the end all and be all and it could be subjective ofc, but I'm really just curious about and want to gauge how this particular thing about me will be generally perceived, dating wise.

At uni I was ugly and spotty and no guys liked me.  I did however lose my virginity at 18 and have a few entanglements. 

Since I turned 21, my looks have drastically improved. My skin has cleared up, I do have a good figure, my hair has got longer and thicker and I've gone blonde. I'm often told I look younger than 26 and i keep to a strict skin care regime. I'm frequently told im good looking.

On top of that, im doing quite well in my career and i hvae my own place. Im also friendly and bubbly.

But i just cannot hold on to any guy. I dated a guy 3 years who basically just saw me as a bit on the side. Other guys i date are only interested in sex, guys who are searching for something more serious toss me aside after 2 or 3 dates regardless of whether I slept with them.

All I have ever really wanted is a happy relationship but the older I get the less likely it seems this will ever happen.

2544,My (22f) boyfriend (23m) would rather game than spend time with me. How do we spend more quality time together?,"



I've been with my partner for six years and I knew how much he loved playing games and I loved that he had a hobby that would make him as happy as it does. Now that we live together it feels like we don't spend much quality time together as he is always gaming. I've suggested doing things, but he's not up for much and he doesn't seem very happy when we are out anyway. I don't want to feel like room mates, I worry it's going to head that way if it carries in. I have tried to join in gaming with him, but he can be gaming for like 12 hours, sometimes more in a day. I've tried talking to him about it, but he doesn't seem to understand. As soon as he wakes up, he doesn't even say hello, it's just straight on the game until he goes to sleep at 3am. It's really getting to me now and I don't know what else to do.",dating
2545,Me (30M) need advice on what to do next with my crush (24F),"Me (30M) goes couple of times a week on my work break to this cafe nearby where she works (24F) -my crush. Started with small chats, then we got to know more about each other, till 2 months ago she told me she just broke up with her bf of five years. As I broke with my ex 5 months ago, and haven't found anythig serious since then, I gave her my number and asked her to join me for bubble tea later that day. She said she couldn't. After 2 weeks or so, while waiting for my coffee had a chat with her, got to know each other better, turns out we have many similar interests and she said she would be keen to grab a drink next week. However, it didn't happen.  
  
After that, her colleague (34F) started showing interest in me, and we got to know eachother better as she is single too, however didn't ask her out or pursue anything, even though kind of ignored my crush and she was left out, unsure if she was jealous or not. After like a week, told my crush I will be going hiking on the weekend and for her to text me if she wants to come, she said she will do that. However she didn't text me or come.Next week I brought one of my colleagues (28F) to the caffe, who is good looking and also likes me, my crush gave me a bit of weird look.  
Should I still pursue or it is already over? What would you do, if you are in my position?",dating
2546,It’s not fair 😭,"I've recently experienced an unexpected and heartbreaking breakup that has left me feeling confused and hurt. It all happened while I was visiting my family in India. When I returned, my partner dropped a bombshell on me - she had decided that we were not compatible.

Throughout our relationship, I had always gone above and beyond to make her happy, often sacrificing my own happiness in the process. I believed that our bond was strong, and I was committed to being there for her in any way I could.
However, it seems that things changed when she moved in with new roommates just a couple of days before my trip.

I couldn't help but notice that she had quickly formed close friendships with her new roommates, and it appeared that they had become her new best friends. I used to be the person she leaned on, the one she shared everything with. But now, it seems she has found emotional support and companionship in her new living situation. And so she didn’t need me anymore. 😖

What struck me the most during the breakup was her swift and determined action of packing up all the belongings she had left at my house. It included the jewelry and other gifts I had given her as tokens of affection. Without any hesitation, she carefully boxed up these items before delivering the news that she wanted to end our relationship. It felt like a deliberate act, almost as if she wanted to ensure that every trace of our connection was removed, including the tangible reminders of the love and care I had poured into choosing those gifts.
The hardest part is seeing her seemingly happy/ relieved after our breakup while l'm left feeling heartbroken and lost. I can't help but wonder why she chose to end our relationship when I had been there for her through her lowest moments. It's a painful realization that sometimes, no matter how much love and care we pour into a relationship, things can still fall apart.

I'm grappling with a mixture of sadness and confusion. It's difficult to accept that someone I loved so deeply could suddenly see us as incompatible. The sadness lingers as I mourn the loss of what we had and the future we had imagined together.

Sharing this story isn't easy, but I hope to find solace and understanding from those who have experienced similar situations. If you have any insights or words of support, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.",dating
2547,Nervous About Maybe Asking A Friend To Date,"Update: I chickened out and ended up driving home, kicking myself and listening to Tom Rosenthal ""Don't Die Curious"" 🥲 But, we're planning on meeting in the next couple weeks, and I'll be a bit braver then 😅

I (26M) have a friend (27F) who's company I really enjoy. I'd like to ask her if she would like to date. It's not like I've been crushing on her for years ever since we met or suddenly realized she's the love of my life, more that I'd like to get to know her better, and find if she is ""that"" person to me, which is the point of dating, right?

Lurking this sub, I'm going to assume the consensus will be to go ahead and ask her, so I won't ask that (unless that isn't the general opinion lol). I've got a lot of anxiety around dating, and I can pretty easily convince myself this will be weird/awkward/wrong, but I'm doing my best to not.

I'm having dinner with her tonight, and I want to ask her then, rather than my usual MO of pining, talking myself out of taking action, and then just telling myself it wouldn't have worked out anyway. 

My question is, what's the best way to go about this? I don't have a lot of dating experience, and haven't asked a lot of people out. I want to make it clear her answer doesn't affect us as friends, and I'll be her friend regardless. I don't  want to come off as pushy or anything, and don't want to make the dinner awkward haha. I like her, and I'd like to date her to get to know her better :)",dating
2548,Did I get a Green light?,"I'm newly single and I went to dinner with an old boss of mine. I can normally pick up the interested signals from women, but this time I'm struggling a bit. She is single as well and we were having great conversation, laughing.  She said that she would be available to do social things with me like hiking, concerts, movies, etc. She mentioned the word friends hanging out which confused me, but I felt I was getting a vibe from her. Then, she asked if I was dating anyone. Do you think that she is interested in a romantic relationship?",dating
2549,So uh...what now?,"Imma keep this short:

Met a girl at a gas station. Asked her out. Talked for a few days, agreed to hang out on our days off.

Its our day off and the plan was to go to her place at 5. I basically do nothing but chill.

I hit her up at 3 just to make sure were still on.

No response.

Hit her up again at 5. No response. I say ""Oh well"" and go to hang with my friends instead. Cut to 7:30 and me and my friends agreed to go out to the pool hall. I finally get a text from her saying she fell asleep. Not wanting to flake on my friends, I go out to decide if I am still down since I was a bit disappointed and not as excited anymore (Been flaked on many times and before she texted me I was kinda down) Me and my friends go to the pool hall, drink some, have a great time and leave around 10. I hit her up decided to head over, she agrees to it.

Go to her place, things are going great, we end up sleeping together. Before we started I said ""I need a condom"" (I had some in my backpack) and she just insists on pulling out. I go ahead and do the deed and simply ask if she felt anything come inside her just to be sure; she said she doesn't know and starts to worry on why I ask. I assure her she's fine, I was just making sure.

We wake up, apparently I was tossing and turning in my sleep keeping her up (Embarassing, only happens when Im drunk). She goes to work and im on my way home, but my motorcycle throttle cable snaps and shes also texting me about last night wondering why I ask and if I can get her a plan B (I can't my motorcycle is not moving at all). I let her know whats up with my bike and assure her shes fine and explained why I asked and not too worry (Easier said than done I know).

fast forward 3 days later, We talk, things seem to be okay, friendly responses and smile emojis. I ask her if she wants to go out and talk sometime but no pressure: she agrees excitedly, and says she has plenty of freetime...I suggest a date idea and my availability, ensuring her I'll be plenty free too.....And....No response...its been 5 days since.

I like her, but dont want to send her constant messages or seem desperate. Any ideas on how to proceed, I assume I must have scared her and she lost interest but I just don't know. She's really cool though and I am tired of looking out here honestly.

TL;DR Date went good, ended somewhat bad, but she agreed excitedly to another date, and then, radio silence. Don't want to seem needy but I also really like her and don't know what to do. maybe take the L and move on?",dating
2550,Is He Avoidant Attachment?,"23(M) and 26(F).

I started dating a guy over a year ago. We dated for about 10 months before I broke it off. When we first met it was insane chemistry. The first night we talked for hours just overlooking some train tracks. The second night was the same, but on a roof top. He lived out of state but was planning to move to the region. I fell really hard and really fast, but tried to stay logical about it. We stayed in contact a lot and would have amazing text threads about anything and everything. We also started talking on the phone and the conversations would last for hours. He started watching my church online and we would have long conversations about God and religion on Sundays. He came and visited me after a month and we, once again, hit it off. He started looking for jobs in my city (I live in a great city with a ton of professional growth for his specific career interests). He just had to finish a contract where he was and he'd move.

After 2 months he asked me to be his girlfriend and said he was falling for me. I agreed to be in a relationship but did not respond with saying I was falling for him. I was nervous. After 5 months he told me he loved me. I said it back.

We talked about owning businesses together, real estate ventures, family values, core values, etc. It felt, to me, like I was vetting him and we were a great match. This was all long distance, but we would see each other for weekends at a time, and sometimes 2 weeks at a time. I met his family, he met my family. We went on a family vacation with my family. Everyone got along. I helped him paint and build a house. Everything was great.

Throughout there were small insecurities on his end that cropped up. I tried to help and make him feel better.

The contract ended and it was time to move, but he couldn't get a job right away. I thought that was relatively normal, but he was new out of undergrad and probably wasn't used to applying to tons of jobs. This is when it got bad. He started nitpicking me and correcting me in public (if he didn't like how my tone sounded). He started pointing out the things he didn't like about me. Things he once loved. I was too intense, how smart I was stressed him out, how healthy I was stressed him out, me making more money than him stressed him out, my voice was too intense, I wasn't warm enough.

He completely withdrew from me, and no matter what I did he wouldn't reciprocate. He still wanted to be intimate, he still wanted to cuddle, but it just was not the same. It felt forced. He didn't touch me like he used to, he didn't make me coffee anymore, he didn't really ask me questions about myself or my life. He also completely gave up on God and started insinuating that our relationship was coincidental and not related to God (opposite of what he was saying at the beginning).

I called for a break and told him to think on what he wants. The break did nothing. He came back still flaky saying he wasn't sure he wanted to move, he didn't know what jobs he wanted. He started saying he was interested in other things that were never on the table, like spending weekends drinking beer and hanging with his buddies (who were not great people). Opposite of the entrepreneur I thought he was. He put no effort to mend our relationship. He was unemployed and didn't even come down to see me and try make things better (I was in school getting a doctroate, I couldn't go to him).

I was on a roller coaster, so I ended it. He wrote me a letter a few weeks later apologizing, saying he was moving, saying he loved me and apologizing for not guarding my heart, promising to win my trust back, etc. Then silence for a month.  Contacted me a month later saying he was in town looking at jobs and wanted to talk. Over the phone he told me the previous letter he sent was done in a fit of emotion. He took it all back. Said he couldn't commit to me even if he moved here.

Well, I just got word he had moved here a month ago. He snuck a letter under my door apologizing profusely, explaing he got ""lost"" and why, wanting to get back together, and saying he will do everything in his power to work on us. That he is committed. That his stress from the job search, financial stress from his father (which is valid), and stress about him being in the national guard got to him and made him question our relationship. That he now realizes relationships take a lot of work, and he wants to put in the work. That he wants to pursue and provide for me. That he loves me and misses me. I didn't respond because I was very overwhelmed.

He snuck another letter under my door and my favorite chocolates. He also now goes to my church despite there being about a billion churches in my city and him actually living half an hour away.

I am not considering taking him back right now. But in a year or so if he worked on himself maybe it wouldn't be off the table?

Is he a typical avoidant or is he just immature? Or both? Or a narcissist? How much is too much? What are normal hurdles for a relationship? Am I just signing up for a huge push-pull relationship where he love bombs me again and then withdraws it all at the first sign of adversity? Sorry for the long story.. :(",dating
2551,26F and emotionally exhausted,"Title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been dating since I was 19, and I’ve only had one LTR that barely lasted a year. This was 4 years ago. I’ve had my heart broken over and over again. This last one has just taken all of the fight out of me. I’m not ugly, but I wouldn’t say I’m hot. I have plenty of hobbies, too many in fact. I have a group of close friends and we would all hide bodies for each other. 

I’ve had plenty of situationships and casual flings and I’m just…tired. No one has wanted anything serious (with me, clearly) but they meet someone right after me and commit to long distance. I’m terrified of being single up into my thirties and forties because I want a family. I want a man that plays Sinatra as we drive to dinner reservations, who is happy that one of my pleasures in life is just holding his hand. 

I’ve long since quit the dating apps, they just made things worse. But this last failed attempt has left me feeling so far underwater that I just don’t have the energy to get back to the surface.",dating

One girl claimed that waiting for lifeguards to tell you to go on the water slide is off putting and not good. 

Another said that if they have long toenails it’s a red flag since it means they don’t care for themselves 

And I’ll leave you with one more another said that liking a lot of girls instagram posts even if it’s their friends it’s also a red flag

For me it seems natural to be friends with an ex (assuming there was no bad blood between us). I never cut people off unless i truly hated them and if i never hate my ex i don't see the problem in staying friends with them. Now if i hated them then it would be a different story

2554,"23M still single, no glue what to do","Well, yes, i’m on a certain point of my life when i don’t find it normal to be single, and not only single, but deeply lonely. Don’t know what to do, and in need of some concrete advises in how to approach, how to find, how everything with girls. As nothing goes natura in my case (by itself)l, and advises like “it will come by itself, yo don’t have to do anything” doesn’t work, i’m feeling that i’m in a deep mud with this, and at the same time living is becoming hell.

Well, here is my quick story, to make a little clearer of my problem.

I’m 23yo male. Born in very poor russian family, spent most of my time studying and working, got literally no social life till finally managed to escape military draft and came to study in spain in 2021. Here i faced a terrible reality that i’m like 10 years late in social skills with the rest of the pple of my age. I still struggle with it, but at least have some progress. Than came war that changed my life and life of my family in so many ways, that i closed myself very, very deeply, till my medication started to work, than i finally got my permission to work as a refugee, and here i am right now: mentally exhausted from last 7 years of hell, but finally with a job, my university studies and stable documents. But the problem that came with me through out all thia years is mu completely loneliness.

Even if i didn’t have much of a social life, i always tried to find someone, and always got rejected. I didn’t count them, but let’s say 15-20 times. And i’m not talking about some “one night adventures” that i’m not interested in, but some potential partner, to be on a one wave, to be really interested in one another. In another words, i’m much of pansexual, rather than hetero.

And right now i’m facing a brutal reality, where i’m 8-10 years late in all that dating/relationship stuff, with no experience about how it works and no glue how to find someone, and at the same time have little free time outside of the job and studies. The feeling of loneliness is eating me from the inside, and it is even worse, realising that i’m thousands km away from my family with no possible way to see them in months, if not years. I really need a partner to start building relationship, to make deep connection between, and damn, i have literally no idea HOW.

To describe a little bit myself: depending on tastes can be rather 6/10 or 8/10, not stupid, but struggling with social interactions. Overthinking all the time, better say, never stop thinking, and aleays think a lot evwn before some small decisions. In some way pple find me funny (most of my style of talking, accent and mimic’s), but also very concentrated in work and solving problems, which is often confused with lack of empathy. Also i’m aleays too direct and honest, that can also intimidate pple or even scary them. 

-dating apps result useless
-friends mostly invite me to other groups of people, where girls are either taken, or not interested in serious relationships
-those girls who reject me just say that they are not interested in me as in a partner
-popular advises “just wait and it will come” and “you will find it when you don’t search for it” is a crap of advise. I know several people who are close to their 50’s and still nothing. The one who has problems is me, not the world, and i’m willing to change things and not just “wait”
-it would have been a good idea to socialize in some places like dancing clases (and i’m planning to do it in future), but even if i found someone who is interested, How do i make it? 

If you can give some advises, or have some similar case, i would be glad to hear them. Thanks!",dating

My first instinct is to always get tested for stds before becoming intimate with someone. But obviously if they are looking to be spontaneous and hookup at like a bar or club or something, there ain't no time for that.

2561,"Parted ways on good terms with FWB six weeks ago. However, one night when we were drinking, she said something that has been consuming my mind since","Currently laying in bed off from work and I am not sure I can talk to anyone about this.

Originally met this great gal [29F] [29M] at the start of 2022. We hit it off on the first date and the sexual chemistry was amazing, so we starting seeing each other casually. That lasted about 4 months and was a great experience. 

At the start of this year I got burnt out of dating with purpose. Sort of felt like my time and energy wasn't received or reciprocated very well. I was looking for something casual and reached out to her, she was interested in my proposition.

This time around, it was far more intense in just about every way, alot happened. I truly enjoyed spending time with her because I felt I could be myself. For example we both opened up to each other and shared tough stories of our past, which I normally don't unless I'm comfortable. I've only done this with two of my long term ex GFs for example.

To recall on that night when we were blind drunk: We were discussing the two of us moving foward, as in a potential relationship. Towards the end of the conversation she uttered the words ""you can't offer me nothing"". I remember going quiet, essentially shutting down my willingness to communicate. That next morning, things didn't feel the same. We ended things respectfully.

Yet another big surgery lies around the corner for me and hopefully the last. I moved back in with my dad in 2019 when I had my first major surgery and missed alot of time away from work. I had no other option and knew it was for the best to for me to not kill my savings and build more, which I have been doing. 

The main point being is, I opened up and explained all of this to her (how I deal with it and what my long-term goals are). This is a big insecurity of mine and am always umcomfortable talking about it. I thought she was aware of that.

I'm not sure why I wrote this but i'm in a bad place mentally and physically right now. I had so much respect for her and that's why I was vulnerable. I'm not sure I can be vulnerable like that again.

Really feel like a loser at the moment because I dont have my own place at 29. I do understand why this is unattractive to women. You should expect a guy of that age to have his stuff together.

However, what she said really destroyed my confidence and future desires for dating all around. Or maybe this was something I need to hear. 

I have been self-reflecting alot lately and I need to work on heaps of things. My main focus is getting properly healthy and smashing goals, the main one is independence.

A big thankyou if you got to the end of this word vomit. Be as honest and blunt as you want with me. I'd appreciate any type of feedback. 

Tldr; FWB who I had alot of respect for said ""you can't offer me nothing"" in regards to a realtionship. I had previously opened up to her about my past and present struggles with my health. In turn this has destroyed my confidence.",dating

2563,What do you all think of this situation?,"So last week, I (28m) met a woman (23f) at work. We were both subs at a school and ran into eachother frequently. The last hour of the day pretty much had us acting as hall monitor. 

We talked the while time and she was very playful in our conversations. I decided to go for it and ask her to join me at a brewery in town, she said yes and we met up there shortly afterwards. 

I was only expecting to be there for an hour, but the conversations kept going on and they started to become more personal and flirtatious. One hour turned into four, and during that time she initiated hand holding. Prolonged and holding with smiles and eye contact. She put her number into my phone too! I was on cloud 9! 

After we finally decided to make our way home I walked her out to her car and we stood there looking into eachothers eyes. She leaned in and I kissed her. We kissed multiple times and held out foreheads together in between. 

I texted her two days later with who I was and asked her how her weekend was. She left me on read. No biggie. 

Then I texted her two days after that I asked her to come with me to a museum in a nearby city the following weekend. (this was something we had in common). 
She left me on read again. This kinda struck me as really odd, but it's not like something like this has happened before with me.

In the past 5 years I can literally count on both hands the number of girls off dating hands I've had actual conversations with. Not just a bit of small talkk for a day or two, but actual conversations. 
I get bored of the apps very quickly so I'll swpe a few times and then just forget for so long my accounts get shut down. Like I said, not much interest in getting out there and I rarely get matches so I just kinda feel meh on everything

Just moved 2600 miles across the country. I've no friends our here, no family. Just me and my dog. 
Decided to try the apps again. 

3 weeks ago I met a girl, she messaged me first(an actual first), and is one of the first few times a woman my age has straight up called me atteactive. And out of the very few women I've had actual conversations with, she's the only one I didnt have to pull teeth to get to talk.  We are borderline the same person, we like the same movies, tv shows, video games, hell we found out 2 days after talking to each other we were both at a heavy metal concert 3 days before she messaged me. 

We went out 2 times and had plans for a third date on Saturday. Unfortunately her babysitter flaked on her so we canceled. I told her it was okay, i get she has kids and i am 100% on board with her kids being her priority. SHE then asked me out for breakfast, i said I was free Tuesday and would love to. She said we could discuss plans the next day as she had to make her kids dinner. I said okay. 
She thanked me again for being understanding about her kids and said most guys get completely mad and just ghost her after an issue with her kids or try and make her feel bad. That It was refreshing that I was different and understanding. 

It's been over 3 days now, and she's not messaged me back at all. And since blocked Me on the app we met on. I'm certain she blocked my number as well because I tried calling once and it just rings. I've only sent her 3 texts since and all were along the lines of ""Hey, hope things are good. We still on for Tuesday?""

Like okay, if you lose interest just fucking say something. I'd rather that than just straight up being ghosted. First person in years I've been excited to talk to and stuff and this happens. 
Now I've got sisters, so I've heard horror stories about when they told guys they weren't interested so like to an extent I get it, but i don't think I ever gsve her any indication I'd be like that. I was always respectful, and decent, something she said was a huge difference in the men she normally talked to from the apps. I was the first person in a while to not treat or talk to her like she was just a piece of meat. Or treat her differently when she said she has kids. 
So I am just confused cause I thought we were getting along really well. And now my introverted, majorly depressed ass just feels like shutting down again and going back to not caring.",dating
2568,"How would you react after finding out bf's friends called you nicknames like ""the hole"" or ""the pole""","I've met a great guy not too long ago and we started dating. He's overall pretty great but we recently had some problems over how his friends referred to me. I found out I was called ""the hole"" at the begining ""as a joke"" which infuriated me and I called him out on allowing this bs. He apologized and indeed things improved and that did not repeat.

Yet 2 weeks later I'm getting called a new nickname- ""the pole"". Since I'm mostly Polish... which once more I think is super disrespectful. I have a name and they know it.

He tried to justify this friend saying he knows my name, the guy ""wasn't being mean"" and I'm Polish so he doesn't see a problem. He also tried to manipulate the situation where he said ""you asked what C said so you asked for it"", basically implying it's my fault...

Yeah my bf and his friends make edgy jokes and has a dark sense of humor and such but this is flat out f*cking disrespectful and pushes me away from him. How would you react in this situation?",dating

2570,"Talking about future, why?","Hi, 
So this is a bit of a random question but something in honestly curious about. Why do some men (and maybe women, but I don't date those, so don't know), so easily talk about future plans together (you shouldn't drive on our holiday together, if we get a dog you should be the one walking it), when we barely know each other (like between date 1-5)? I mean these are not big players or something (those aren't my type), but I have noticed this communication style more than once.

2571,How to escape the insecurity cycle? M30,"How do you escape the cycles of feeling unwanted, that leads to insecurity, that makes it even harder to date, that leads to more insecurity, and it just continues in a downward spiral. Women won't even consider an insecure man an option, and from reading the most about married men, it seems like they don't even consider single men an option.  

So how do I get out of this? Nothing has worked before, not therapy, not exercise, definitely not dating apps, those only make it worse. Trying to develop confidence in other areas doesn't matter because as soon as women are involved it all disappears, I'm just used to them ignoring and ghosting me, and feeling completely unwanted by them. And please, don't just offer vague advice like ""work on myself"", that doesn't help me in anyways.",dating

He definitely communicates with me less, I wondered if it’s because we see each other now. I sort of brought something up and he reassured me he was really into me and everything. Yesterday he even told me he bought me jewelry but didn’t want to give it to me yet. He invited me on a vacation at the end of June and then something in mid July. That made me think he liked me a lot but now I think it means nothing at all and maybe I was just available to ask. It’s giving me anxiety and I can’t deal with more of that. I don’t want to be labeled as crazy for bringing it up and idk how to. I kind of feel like I should just completely cut things off. I’m a single mom which he seemed BEYOND cool with, even told me he pictured getting a little house with me. I know that sounds like a lot but he wasn’t really weird about it just said it was something he’d thought about. I haven’t truly dated or liked any guys I’ve went out with in over two years. I like him so much but I can not be momming and having anxiety over men. Am I dramatic?",dating
2573,Self love/don’t look for it,"I have been hearing this from a lot of people within my family and through certain people that I talk to on a professional level (take a wild guess).

How the hell is self-love supposed to help me with finding a relationship?

At what point can something be a matter of you not loving yourself enough? Having self-love and then therefore having the ability to love someone else makes no sense because the person you want to love is not you. The person you want to love has their own life and their own set of beliefs or values that they have, whether you agree with some or you have similar beliefs of your own is a different story, but the general idea is that you’re supposed to love them. 
If you are trying to have a relationship with someone, you show them love and affection. You showing them that you care about them has nothing to do with what your thought process is unless it’s related to you thinking that they are ridiculous or that they are dumb for believing in something that you don’t agree with. I don’t see any correlation with how you liking yourself or how you are able to handle yourself relates to any kind of relationship, in this case a dating relationship, but I also don’t see how it would help in any other kind of relationship with bodies like friends or family.

Also, at what point is the trope “stop looking for love. Love Will find you“ actually real?

I understand the concept of this because I’ve been explained the concept about 15 times over by my parents and grandparents. The concept as I understand it is that when you are not looking for someone that you want to start a relationship with, like you are just minding your own business living about your life, you find someone and that someone is the person who you’re gonna spend your life with. 
How are you going to be aware of when someone has an attraction to you In a romantic sense when you were not looking for someone? If you are actively looking for someone then you are aware of what red flags to pay attention to if they pop up, you are aware of flirting signals such as women pulling their hair back to expose their ear and the side of their face or when they are looking at you dead in the eyes as opposed to wondering off elsewhere, or you are generally aware of what’s going on between you and a potential romantic partner. You are not aware of any of that if you are not looking for the signs. 
If you have someone who is working with you and you are just seeing them as a professional business relationship, then you won’t pay attention to that coworker having certain flirtatious hand signals or body movement gestures.
If you have one or two customers coming in at a very high frequency and they are asking to see you or they are asking where you are, you don’t see that as someone being interested in you but rather you see it as they are very satisfied with the service you provide while you’re at work and they believe that you can help them where others can’t.
Even if you were out in the middle of the street on your way to work or to a restaurant and you passed by someone, you’re not gonna pay attention to whether or not that person looked at you and did the stereotypical double look where it’s a case of “man, that person looks good. I wonder if they’re single” because you’re too focused on going to work we’re grabbing some lunch.

What does self-love have anything to do with you being able to love someone if the person you are wanting to love is their own person?
How can love find you when you are not able to notice what the signals are just due to you trying to live your own life or you trying to do some thing that at the moment doesn’t involve a romantic partner?",dating
2574,Would you date a guy with this kind of hobby?,"There's this guy, he and I are supposed to start out as friends, and if we like each other enough to move forward in the relationship, then that's on us. We've met a couple of times in person, but he lives a distance away from me, so scheduling a meet up is a bit of a chore. He is... a weird guy. I don't want to bash the guy, but he is moving so fast for me that I have to strongly put my foot down sometimes to get him to listen. For example, he would message me telling me, not asking me, telling me he's coming over (ive never told him my address, thank goodness) or we are going to hang out on this particular day, and he's just barreling through the conversation, sending rapid fire messages. And I think what he's trying to do, is hoping that I would just say yes to whatever he's saying, and then we'll have a date set, whether I actually want it or not. In his defense, I've never allowed us to meet anywhere that's not a public restaurant or mall, but we're supposed to just be friends first, so. And I'd like to emphasize that he really has this fixation on wanting to come over to my house, and I really don't like that, I like there to be a certain boundary between us at all times, thank you very much, so I always tell him my house isn't fit for guests.

And normally, I would be incredibly appreciative of any man who would take the time to message me everyday, but in this case, it's just creepy to me. And all of this, I could still forgive, maybe he's just really eager or something, and he really wants to meet up and this is his way of ""asking"". It's possible.

But a friend of mine, upon hearing about what he's doing, decided to do some digging on the guy. And after a light Facebook search, my friend discovered a picture in a now public animegao kigurumi group, and it was a selfie of the guy wearing a skintight suit, no head yet. My eyes are burning just remembering that cursed picture. The face was covered by an emoji, but it was him, because his profile, actual profile was the one who posted the picture. I double-checked everything, it's the same account I friended when I met him, same account that messages me everyday, same account that posted the picture.

Either, the guy is so technologically inept, that he figured no one would be able to find the pictures. Or he had a different profile pic when the group was private, and he figured he would be safe if he just only changed his pfp, not knowing the group would be change to public. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't care. I'd also like to add that kigurumi isn't necessarily a fetish, but the group the guy joined is most definitely a fetish group. 

I've made up my mind on what I'm going to do next, but I wanted to ask you guys, what would you do if you discovered this about a man you're dating?? Would it be a dealbreaker for you?",dating
2575,"Me, 18 F being liked by older guys (26-30), am i just a toy , any advice ?","So i am for the first time, open to date people, since prior i wasn't allowed to. 
My friend recommended me bumble, and i thought why not ? 
But all the guys that like me are older (like an average age gap of 7 years), very well educated, mostly studying engineering, med or are very talented and passionate musicians,like conductors or opera singers. I do find these men very interesting, yet I'm not sure, if they actually ""get"" anything from talking to me, let alone an from a relationship with a girl my age. I'm mature, and even in real life older men have taken an liking to me, tho they would comment on my eyes and many physical traits and on intelligence later on. Even so,  that doesn't help me keep up a Convo if i simply haven't made the same choices or similar experiences as them yet.
In general, what do we possibly share where he doesn't get put into a position of constantly ""teaching"" me.
My guess is that these men are either just looking for a 'good time' or they mean it. Since i won't ask directly yet, i am asking the men and women of reddit to give me insight. What are some signs of rather other intend?maybe some insights on guys around that age could help, or experiences with dating an 18 year old and reverse .

2577,Having a hard time maintaining connections with people I meet,"27M, for the past year of trying to date I keep ending up in the same place. First few dates go well and we enjoy time spent and all that, but I get to a point where I just don’t really know what to say or talk about with people I suppose. 

For current reference I had been seeing this girl for a couple dates which went well, then this weekend we hung out with her friends Friday and Saturday, and both days their group was having a good time and chatting and I just didn’t know how to add to their conversations. Anything I wanted to say just felt awkward and interjected. Like where one person says something and everyone looks at them weird and says “uh ok” then goes back to their conversation if that makes sense. I ended up just not really talking because I felt awkward and sort of uncomfortable. All the conversations felt inclusive to all of them and I just didn’t really know how to add to them and be a part of it.

I could tell I was loosing her interest because of the past two days and today I got the text i was inevitably waiting for:

“I did just want to reach back out and say that I don’t see this going forward between us. I do appreciate the time we spent together and I wish you well, but I don’t see us really connecting. I’m sorry!”

This has been re-occurring with me and I feel like I’m not fun enough to be with at this point. I feel like the dude that gets talked about that has no personality. I don’t know if it’s social anxiety or what, it doesn’t feel that way at least.

I don’t really know how to better my people skills or what I need to do. I come on great initially and am a good time once I’m comfortable but I constantly loose at the small talk and group banter with groups of people I’ve never met which has lost the connections everytime so far and it’s beginning to make me not want to keep trying, I end up feeling unlikeable  and honestly just shitty for lack of a better term",dating

2583,Is this how dating is these days?,"I (18f) have been on dating apps and have been on a few dates. I met up with two guys this month, and each experience broke me a little inside. 

The first guy I went out with was someone I clicked with immediately after starting to talk. We had very different views on life and only a few shared interests, but we loved talking to each other and each others company. We went on a first date and it went really well in my opinion. We got boba, saw a movie, and cuddled a lot. We were both really happy about it. We planned a second date and I thought it went well! He even kissed me and asked me to be his girlfriend. Two days later, he calls me saying he wants to break up, saying something vaguely like, “I’m not ready for a relationship,” and, “you’re just not very attractive to me.” It was complete whiplash going to this from cuddling and flirting a lot with each other.

The second guy I met not too long after. We didn’t hit it off as quickly as the first one, but he was kinder and we shared many more interests and views. We really liked each other, so we planned a first date. We also ate and saw a movie, and we were going to do more than that but he said he wanted to go home and rest instead. I ask him about what’s wrong because he seemed a bit off on the date, and he says that he had this feeling of uncomfortableness with me the entire date. He said he couldn’t pin it down to any sort of reason relating to me, but he didn’t want to see me anymore. 

My parents say that his is just how dating is these days, I think that somehow I’m the problem and I’m completely inept at irl dating. I apologize for the rant but I need advice.

I am a 21 bisexual year old guy (still in college), that has been with a few partners at this point in my life. When it comes to dating, I am a pretty confident and positive when it comes to dating. It’s not like I feel like no one likes me because I know that a lot of people want to get to know me and spend time with me. The issue I keep running into is that I’ve never have felt the same way towards any of my partners. In the beginning I feel like I do but then a couple months later, I feel no sort of attraction or interest in them. And while I do handle communicating these feelings to them pretty well (not dragging them along). I’m getting tired of reaching dead ends and breaking people’s hearts. It’s not like I feel sad to be leaving them but it hurts in a way to continuously deliver bad news to people that care about me and see something with me. 

I feel like I do better on my own, so that’s why I’ve considered just not dating anymore. I guess my worry is that I’ll regret this down the line. So I guess the questions I have are for the people that have been living their life single: Do you regret not dating or settling down?

2589,Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t hate online dating,"I’m 40f and newly back on the dating scene after taking 2.5 years off to get my shit together. Lost 100lbs, prioritized my mental health, stopped drinking, and just turned my life on a better path. I’ve been dating again for the first time in years since April. Y’all, I love it so much! I’ve had some terrible dates don’t get me wrong but I finally feel like I’m getting the type of attention that I want and it’s overall been a very positive experience for me. I have noticed though that when I’m on dates or talking to someone about online dating, everyone is like “oh it’s the worst, I hate it don’t you?” And I really don’t hate it at all. Yesterday I was out with some friends and some new people I didn’t know and we somehow got talking about online dating because a couple other people there were also dating too. I mentioned that it wasn’t horrible and this woman I didn’t really know was like “oh, people actually pay attention to you, must be nice” and it’s just like sorry? Idk I feel like I’m in the minority sometimes for liking it but it’s been really good for my self esteem and I’ve made some meaningful connections through it.

2590,I need advice on dealing with a woman at work,"I (32M) have known this woman (26F) for the past couple years. We met through work, and we run into each other at work about once every couple days. She would often come by my desk to flirt. She would always pinch my arm, admire how tall I was, ask for hugs, mess with my hair, mess with my computer, hit me on the shoulder, and rub up against me in a dirty thoughts sort of way. After a few weeks of this, she asked for a kiss on the mouth, and I was very fond of it. I caught feelings for her after some time of doing this.

However, her behavior outside of work has always been the complete opposite. She would rarely, if ever, respond to my texts unless it was something directly work related. She would also never want to hang out outside of work. I would get frustrated by her distancing and not text her for a few days, only to be met with her flirt game at work again. Thus began the constant cycle of hot-and-cold, with her being fun and flirtatious at work and cold and distant outside of work. Rinse and repeat this behavior for months with no real outcome. I always felt like an option to her. I always knew that in the back of my mind that there was something going on with her that she wasn't telling me about, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly what it was.

I eventually got tired of trying to figure her out and just moved on. I figured that if she really liked me, then she would be making herself available outside of work to talk and hang out. When I first met her, I really did like her and saw potential in a possible relationship. Maybe I was just lonely and therefore vulnerable. It took quite some time to remove these feelings that I had developed for her, but I felt like moving on was the right thing to do.

I told her the other day that I found a new girlfriend, and suddenly her attention on me is ten-fold. She began blowing up my phone asking me what my plans were this weekend and if I wanted to hang out (for the first time ever - I declined). Her phone broke, and she dug up my email from god knows where and started messaging me via email. And if I didn't answer her emails in a timely fashion, then I would start to receive Instagram messages from her. This new behavior was the complete polar opposite of how she acted before. I interpreted her newfound behavior as friendly, because maybe I had pressured her too much earlier with getting to know her, and she feels more comfortable chatting knowing that I have a girlfriend.

Last night, she texted me asking about what kind of sex me and my new girlfriend are having. I gave her some super vague details, and she began to act a bit wild and spilling all kinds of details about her sexual partners that she has. She then tells me openly that I was one of EIGHT guys that she kissed last year at work, and that she has kissed another FIVE guys this year. She also further admits having given ""lots of blowjobs"" to those same guys that she works with (not me) while on lunch break with them and told me about all of the other new men that she is trying to get attention from. She then proposed the idea of giving me a blowjob later this week (after literally just telling her I got a new girlfriend a few days prior), and I gave her the most polite ""hell no"" I could have ever given her. For the record, me and her only kissed and have never done anything else.

When she told me the above, I could literally feel my stomach trying to turn itself inside out. It made me feel so incredibly disgusted.  She is talking to other men that may or may not (most likely not) have any idea that they are being played with. I feel cheap and disposable, like a toy in her toybox that she can take out and play with incase her other toys don't work. I feel like nothing but a commodity to her; a shell of an individual that was used for fun and games. And all of that flirtatious fun we had over the years that I thought was meaningful has all been a game to her. It makes me feel so incredibly disgusted to say that I once considered a relationship with her. And I bet most (if not all) of these other guys she is playing with would also admit that they too have feelings for her! She didn't tell share any names with me for obvious reasons.

I called out of work today because I couldn't sleep from the anxiety, and I have to go back into work tomorrow. I am seriously dreading it. I am so disgusted, and I don't want anything to do with her, my work or anything remotely involving that environment right now.

From this story I have a couple questions:

1. What is the BEST way to avoid dealing with these types of people in the future? How do I know the difference of someone playing with me, compared to someone genuinely having interest in me?
2. What is the BEST way to handle my current situation while not involving switching employers? I can maybe try to transfer to a different department.
3. What is the BEST way to handle her? I don't even think I could look at her anymore. 

I want nothing to do with her, but I love my job and I want this to be behind me. Something has to change but I don't know what.

But I don't want to exist anymore and play this endless game of heartbreak. I feel like there isn't one person out there for me.. Everyone tells me I need to work on myself and love myself. I do. I do nothing but work on myself and love myself and love others. My heart bleeds to have some of that love be given by and to someone else. It's not a linear thing like everyone likes to believe.  I could be the perfect version of myself, try anything, and still nothing. Not even a consideration. The thing is I do love myself I believe I'm a good person who is willing to do anything for those he cares about. I accept myself flaws and all. Nobody's perfect. I just feel immense dread that I'll be alone forever. I'm told I just need to wait and someone will come to me. But that hasn't rang true for 4 years. And when I search for someone. Nobody wants me. Sorry for the long post. Tldr: dude is tired of being alone and is afraid of being alone forever.",dating

She already been trying to ask guys to hangout and I know for a fact she’s been on like two dates already and they’ve been late at night too so you know what that means…. 

What are your guys opinions about dating after you found tour spouse cheating and haven’t yet finalized your divorce?

  Now last night I was out with my friend and this girl he is recently talking to showed up with her friends. I started talking to one of her friends and asked her questions to get to know her a little bit. She seemed pretty cool and was really nice. After a bit I asked if she had a boyfriend. In which she said she didn’t. I said we should hangout sometime. So she turned around and said we are hanging out. And for the rest of the night she kept her back towards me.

2600,the paradigm between wanting sex and wanting a relationship,"So it’s my first time posting on Reddit and I hope this goes well. Here we go! 

This post is about my personal struggle with my sex life/love life. It’s hard to know what to even call it because of how confused I am about what the right thing to do is. To understand what I mean, let me give you some more information. 

Hello, I’m a 24F and currently single. I had a few relationships in the past. One was a long-term relationship (lasted around 6 years) and the other ones lasted maybe a few months. During my long term relationship I thought I’d found the love of my life. Obviously, over the 6 years we were together we planned our futures together. However, our religious differences, age difference, and lack of maturity (since we were both fairly young), resulted in us mutually deciding to end the relationship for good. 

After we broke up, I had a brief “rebound” or “hook up” phase where I didn’t really care to focus on my love life. If the opportunity to date or have sex presented itself and I wanted it, I’d take it. After a while of being single and spending time growing, and discovering myself, I realized that I didn’t want to partake in hook-up culture. It wasn’t fulfilling or emotionally satisfying to have sex or date meaninglessly. I realized that I wanted to focus on myself and learn to love myself first before committing to anyone. Although hook-ups and one night stands, along with the occasional dates, were satisfying in the moment, it made me feel less and less like myself. As an emotional and empathetic person by nature, I found it draining on myself to exchange energies with people who didn’t value or truly care about me. I realized that in order to feel whole, I had to spend time alone and if the opportunity to date ever came along, it would be with the intention of dating for a relationship and not simply for fun. 

It’s been about 1-1.5 years since I had this realization. I’ve definitely grown and matured a lot in this time. I’m in a place in my life where I am happy and content with how things are going. Most importantly my focus is on the aspects of life that matter the most to me: my family, my friends, my lifestyle, my health, my future, my work, and more. I used to be lonely but now I am happily, alone. Of course, at times I miss the small intimate things that a relationship brings like sharing how your day went with someone or cuddling at night or going on dates. These are more so desires that pop into my head once in a while but go away just as fast. However, the desire to have sex and receive/give physical pleasure doesn’t go away. I think about sex at least once a day. There’s only so much that masterbation and sex toys can do. Sex isn’t just about physical stimulation and pleasure, it’s also about the emotional stimulation. Seeing someone desire you and get pleasure from you, hearing them moan, feeling their skin on yours; these are sensations and thoughts that masterbating and using toys can’t give you. 

So my question to all of you is this: do you also feel the same struggle? Of course, wanting sex is a natural human condition but I know deep inside I don’t want to have sex for the sake of sex. But calming down my sex drive and giving my body what it wants is hard without a partner. What is the right thing to do here? I feel like it’ll be a while before I find my soulmate. As much as I could wait to have meaningful sex until I find someone worthy, the frustration is building up. I’ve had opportunities to hook-up with people since I had this realization and even when I thought I’d go through with it, I couldn’t. When it came down to the actual act of having sex or even just touching someone, I felt disgusted and wrong. I felt like I was forcing myself to do something I didn’t truly want. The irony here is that I think about sex and crave it everyday, so clearly I do want it. The thought of it excites me. I’m tired of ruining all my progress and happiness because of this one issue. 

At first, these feelings didn’t bother me so much but now I ponder it a lot and thought I’d take a shot in the dark and see what people on Reddit think. 

Thanks for reading and sharing!",dating
2601,Situationship Break Up,"Me and this guy worked together and became really close over the past year and a half. We never officially labeled it but we were kind of together. He went to my mothers wedding without me inviting him and we hung out all the time and talked every day. We never had sex and he's never had a girlfriend before.
A few months ago, he just stopped replying and texting me and I figured it was over. But now we are sort of talking again and on better terms. I don't know what to think. What are your opinions? Why would he have left in the first place?",dating
2602,Cold Approach Bail,"I (28m) was just waiting in line at the bank when a really cute girl (probably 22-23?) was being helped. But she looked back at me and we made eye contact for a few seconds so I just said hi, then twice more she looked back at me. 

Since she kept looking at me, I took that as a sign she might be a little bit into me, so I decided if I got the chance I would strike up a conversation. 

I was helped by a different clerk and we end up walking to the parking lot at the same time. Since it’s a nice sunny day I was just like “this day seems perfect heading into the weekend”. But she just said “haha yeah” and kept glued to her phone. So I was going to follow up with something else but at that point with there being no interest shown, I just kept walking to my vehicle. 

Now i’m bummed that I at least didn’t try to keep it going since I didn’t have anything to lose —- should I have said something else or did I do the right thing by just letting her go about her day with the lack of an enthusiastic reply?",dating
2603,Got ghosted after saying I'm going through therapy?,"I was chatting with a really lovely young woman. The chemistry seemed cautiously hopeful on both ends.

I was heading to a ketamine therapy session and I told her that I'd be unavailable for the next 2 hours because I was going to this session.

The conversation went from really active and frequent to non existent the second I sent that message.

Ketamine therapy is a bit out there and very intense but I was shocked that it causes such a reaction.

Curious what other people's take is on this?

For backstory, I'm a veteran and also have severe relational trauma from my cheating ex wife so those are the primary reasons that I sought out this particular form of therapy.",dating

2606,What a gentleman! I just went on a date with him.,"I met him on hinge, and unlike any other chat I've had on the site, we agreed to a date within the first two hours of conversing and didn't exchange another word until we met up for our date a few days later. He took me to a coffee shop and repeatedly requested for permission to touch me and kiss me, despite the fact that it was clear from my body language that I wanted physical interaction. I felt like crying since no one has ever treated my body or boundaries with such respect before, and I certainly didn't believe I deserved it. It seems like the absolute minimum, but even that is rarely provided. I wanted to write this down as a warning to anyone who, like me, goes into a date expecting to go through some form of bodily or emotional discomfort. You are absolutely within your rights to request the quantity of personal space you need to feel secure. Providing your consent is quite alluring.",dating

We started talking over the phone I thought it was great. I'm a quiet person and have had struggles making friends in the past. On top of that I had just cut out who I thought was my best friend, so I was desperate to talk to someone. H was nice and seemed interested in what I was saying, so I thought he wanted to be my friend. I thought he was my best friend. He took me to our first 2 homecomings, and everything was great. I really liked hanging out with him. Now I'm Ace and for me, I'm not looking for relationships I just don't want one. Anyway, I guess he was going around and telling people that we were a thing. Now he never and I mean never asked or told me we were in a relationship. I only found out when he decided to “break up” with me. I was left speechless and confused, like what the fuck. I never agreed to date him. I heard people talking about it but I assumed it was a joke since me and H never talked about it. Anyway, I miss his friendship and now he avoids me.

2609,Losing my mind with this fight and constant misunderstanding,"I (25F) have been with my (29M) boyfriend in a relationship for three months, almost one month and a half into the relationship he changed and stopped calling everyday like we used to, when I brought it up and told him he changed he said I’m so fragile and we had a fight. We got into a fight almost three weeks ago, and since then he has changed and it’s draining me. We fight a lot, it’s mostly cause he always misunderstands me and everything I say turns into a fight. The last fight was when we were supposed to go out and he really didn’t sound in the mood to, I told him if he’s not in the mood we can just leave it for another day. When I said that he didn’t talk to me for four days, when I texted him to ask if things are gonna stay like this he told me he’s unhappy with me and he has his doubts about the relationship and I’m always assuming the worst about him. (Just cause I ask if he’s ok or not when he sounds a bit off) he thinks that’s me doubting him. He said we can work things if I try and change. 

Problem is I don’t know how to change!! He doesn’t call me, he doesn’t initiate texts, and when I text him to ask him how he’s doing he just answers with one word and doesn’t even bother asking me how I’m doing. We haven’t seen each other since 3 weeks and everytime I bring up that I’m not liking the distance between us he said he told me what to do, which is change. How is he gonna see the change if we’re not talking or even texting?!

I don’t wanna give up on the relationship because obviously the issue is from me?

I don’t know what to do or how to act, his coldness and distance is making me lose my mind and I’m not sure on how to show him I’m “changing”. 

TL;DR what’s the problem with us? Should I end things or try to show him I’ve changed? And how do I even show him that I changed",dating

I am also on the shy side as well and it takes me awhile for me to fully get comfortable around someone new.

2612,Is this an inappropriate crush?,I’m a 24 yr old female. I have a crush on my 19 year old friend. We have known each other for years. Since I was 12. I’ve had a thing for him for awhile and I’m sorry if that’s wrong. Obviously not when I was 12. He was like 7 and I barely paid attention to him until later. I never crossed boundaries. Never did anything to make him uncomfortable. Wouldn’t even hug him. That’s obviously weird. He had a huge crush on me. I never gave him any reason to. He just did. And I’ve never liked anyone else that much younger. But He just always made laugh harder than anyone. I swear. He’s so funny. And when we hang out (always around others at gatherings) I feel like I have so much fun with him. Anyone is this all fucked up? This generation is quick to be like you’re grooming. well we had to hang out. I really had no choice with us working together at church lol. At some point I was even mean to him bc I didn’t want him to say or do anything inappropriate. Our friendship ended at that point bc I felt weird about it. I was like 21 at the time.

I am attempting to tell myself/accept the fact that I am just unable to date. Nobody within my preference would want to date a geeky, socially awkward 22 year old white guy. I've come to the realization that I would need to settle with someone I wouldn't find attractive and I don't want to live like that. The issue is, deep down I REALLY want to find that special person and that's what's making me go crazy.

2617,GF Only Ever Wants to Pleasure Me and Never Wants/Expects the Same,"Not sure if this is the right sub but I have to ask a question to female redditors out there. Why might a woman focus only on pleasuring her man and not getting pleasured herself?

My (24M) GF (29F) seems to looove my d\*ck and always wants to stroke it and suck it or watch me go to work myself. She has a generally submissive personality and she says pleasing me sexually makes her happy. But she never seems to want me to do the same for her. She'll let me touch her private areas while she's clothed and she likes me reaching up her skirt but she never gets fully naked and never wants me to actually go down on her or finger her or anything like that. I've never seen her orgasm but she's said she's done it while clothed just from making out with me and other physical contact. For additional context, we've agreed to hold off on PIV for a while because we both have bad or uncomfortable experiences with it in the past.

Is this weird? Why might she be reluctant about this? I feel kinda bad because I often see women online complaining about the opposite: the orgasm gap and men not being invested in pleasuring them. I WANT to do it but SHE WON'T LET ME.",dating

I'm a professional drummer and work in mental health services mainly forensic hospitals. I live in Devon England. Have my own house, drive and 2 cats. 

So I don't get much attention on dating apps/in person and struggle to get dates. If I do, I then they don't stay long. I've thought maybe I could come across as too keen/needy so have even tried the less texty/need approach also and still struggle. If anyone would like to see a bit of my chats with girls then I'm willing to share in private messages. 

A short breif on how I go about it. So I usually chat for say 3-5 days on dating sites before they disappear or  making an idea if I want a date then will ask them if they want to meet. I then go on roughly 3/4 dates before telling them that I think they are my type (not that I fancy them) and would like to keep meeting and see how it goes. Then move from there. I don't often get to date 3 or if I do I might get e.g. 5-7 dates before they disappear or cool it off.

2627,"Was I wrong to break up with her? (Slight NSFW, mention of sex)","Back in February 2019, my first girlfriend broke up with me, and I went into a spiral of sadness for quite some time. In July 2020, I met a girl on Tinder. She was really nice, and really into me. Definitely my type: funny, cute, sweet, caring, cuddly (especially since she was thicc; quite the butt), shared interests with me, and best of all, was a real horndog like myself. We really seemed to hit it off, and we made it official a month later. However, I started to feel off as time went on. I kept feeling burnt out and like my love had been “switched off”. She was always asking me to come over and stay after work, which did cost me in both fuel and exhaustion (because I’d have to get up early to get to work on time). It was always me going to stay with her rather than the other way around, but it wasn’t like I was asking for her to because I didn’t feel like I could. She’d also always be spending on stuff outside the house (whether it be food or sundries), and I’d feel obligated to spend along with her. She probably didn’t intend to make me feel that way, but I always feel like I have to spend when I’m out with someone. Our financial habits were very different. I was also a little worried about her making sure she always took “the pill” (I did have condoms with me at all times, but we always ended up going without; stupid I know) and my Mom always stressed me over her potentially having a hold over me if she conceived, though she always over-worries about things. Overall, I think this made me feel like even though over a year had passed since my first breakup, I wasn’t ready for a new relationship yet.

I was worried about leading her on, and I didn’t wish to do that, so I tried to do the (retrospectively) cowardly action of breaking up with her via sending a card. This just led to her turning up on my doorstep and having an hour’s crying session in her car. She begged me to keep trying for a while, which I complied with, but shorter than expected and I asked her to meet me somewhere where we could talk. This time, I told her in person that we had to end things. I didn’t want to hurt her anymore than I already had and I was very sorry to her that it took falling in love again that I wasn’t ready yet. She wanted to remain friends but I declined because that would be too risky. Despite the emotions, we left on good terms, and I gave her a parting gift of a soft toy rabbit I had been saving for the next special someone that came into my life. That was the second relationship in my life, and also my shortest.

Within the past couple of years, I’ve tried dating on and off with little to no success; either getting ghosted before meeting them, ghosted after meeting them, or I said after meeting them “I’m sorry, this isn’t going to work”. So looking back at what I had with her…I’m wondering if I made a mistake…Did I cut my nose off to spite my face? For all the things I felt were wrong with our relationship, there were several things I loved about her more than anything and was very happy to have, to be able to find someone as special as this in this vast ocean of a dating pool. Was I wrong to give it all up over some potentially misguided fears or anxieties? I still have her number in my Whatsapp history, is it worth reaching out & trying again? I don’t know, I just don’t know…",dating

2629,My gf of 5 month want to be abstinent till marriage now,"
We’ve been going out for almost 6 months now and sex great for both of us. She has 4 kids so it doesn’t happen too often maybe once a week if we are lucky. Out of no where she now wants to become abstinent till marriage. 2 of her kids were had out of wedlock. I’ve also been the best father figure these kids have ever known according to her. She has had these let’s calls them episodes or breakdowns out of nowhere and she says crazy mean things. Then the next day tells me how sorry she is cries and cries telling me none of them are true and she only says them because she’s scared I’m going to hurt her like every other guy she’s ever trusted. She admits I’ve never done anything to make her not trust me or even given her the slightest reason. I love this women and her kids as my own, but is it naive to think it will get better because she says she finally opened up her heart to me? What should I do?",dating

As much as I would like to suppress my thoughts, my thoughts just pops all these things in my head. Since now that they are there, these are making me sad. I have no one to talk to since emost of the them already know what happened. I am so sad that most things that used to enjoy I can't enjoy. I am so sad like so freaking sad. I try to enjoy the things but I can't help but feel sad. It's hard to detach yourself from sadness and be mindful. It just gets overwhelming at times. I feel sick and have a sense of worthlessness but I know I am not. It's just so hard to keep going through this everyday. It has been 2 and half months and I haven't moved on. Everything just hurts like hell. I would tear up at random times if it gets too overwhelming. I want to cry but it hurts to cry so I just keep myself from crying. It really hurts like hell. I try to distract but it feels like my mind knows that I am trying to distract it and keeps from being distracted. Rejection and attachments hurts. I am begging for some sort of being to make it stop but I know nothing will help. I don't know how long will this feeling last. It hurts so much.

And some of the arguments I’ve see from some of these people are toxic. Calling foreign woman basically dumb and Slaves to many who just want better woman yet they wonder why guys are leaving. But even me myself I can understand the sentiment. I’ve talked romantically with woman who have moved here from out of state both online and in my personal life and the treatment they give you compared to what’s out here is pretty night and day.

2639,Dating first girl in over a year and she makes me feel sick,"For context, I'm 17. In April a girl slid into my DM's and struck up a conversation. She invited me to come see a play she was acting in (Hamlet) and I talked to her a for a few minutes afterwards before she had to go clean up. Afterwards I asked out for coffee, she said yes, however when I followed up she left me on read for a week.

I thought it was just over, but fast forward a week later, she started talking to me again, and invited me to get coffee that night. I went out with her, and it was fine, albeit short. For the next three days we called for hours each night, and sexted for one of them. She complimented me a lot.

Since last week, we have gone out four times and had car sex twice. Each date has lasted 3-5 hours, too. She has initiated all of them. 

She makes me sick. I love her personality and think she's beautiful, but having sex and not being exclusive is crazy to me. When I do something like that it makes my brain feel as if i'm supposed to be deeply connected with the person, but we aren't. She could very well go off with another guy right now.

I just can't understand how you can have sex and not be exclusive. I've only done that with one other person, and it was deep into the relationship. My first kiss with this girl wasn't even a kiss... it was making out in a movie theatre watching a horror movie. We haven't even had a normal kiss. 

Also whenever we text she leaves me on read a lot. In my last relationship, leaving eachother on read was tantamount to a war crime. I get anxious that she might ghost me whenever she doesn't reply because of the first time she didn't reply for a week. It's a dumb thing but it makes me anxious and worsens my day.

These last two paragraphs make me concerned she might just be interested in the sex, and not an actual relationship. It feels so odd to be intimate with somebody without being able to say ""I love you"" afterwards. I don't get it. It's hardly enjoyable. I also worry I have residual toxicity from my last relationship. My last girlfriend was extremely toxic and I unfortunately contracted a lot of it from her.

I feel so weird about this. I don't know if i'm out of touch and feeling bad about something great or what, but it feels so strange how fast she's going given the fact that we aren't exclusive, and how she ghosted me for a week earlier.",dating

2642,How do I get access to casual sex?,"Heya! I didn't had much sex in my life because I'm a shy, lonely and introverted person. I'm in my low 30s now and wanna start trying to have that soon, because I feel that I can die in any day of the next few years with bigger and bigger chances every day.So what do I need to do to get some casual sex with no relationships? I hate dating, going out, being in relationships in general, I don't have needs for that. I only crave sex. and feel desperate enough to find braveness for that.

I pretty much don't know anyone in my city, but it's population should be around 1 mil, so it's probably possible to find someone. But I live in Eastern Europe so majority of girls probably won't be into such things.

Im currently testing the waters with one of my friends and it seems like we both share at least some level of deeper appreciation for each other. Most of our connection forms through long and engaging conversations (roundabout 1h daily with almost 100% eye contact).

Well, the past few days they asked me some unexpexted stuff, what caught me offguard. For example today I got asked what my opinion on rating girls on a scale from 1 to 10 is and if Id be interested in playing the 2 truths, one lie game. 

It feels like theyre testing the waters, esspecially with other comments like ""on friday Ill cuddle you to death"" (were having a movie night with another friend), or  just a simple ""Im proud of you"", after I said Im proud of myself for my good workout today.

Id be very interested in your opinions on this.

2648,I (28M) got ghosted twice by the same girl (23F) and i am honestly struggling to cope,"So this girl and me are coworkers. We met at a some company gathering around a year back, but never pursued each other.

Fast forward to February this year, we randomly started chatting more and more daily about all kinds of stuff which led me to ask her out. That was the first time she ghosted.

At that point we've been texting for 3 weeks (she was out of town with her family so i couldn't ask her out sooner) and i got left on read. Ok, weird, but i moved on.

A couple of weeks later she started liking my IG posts and stories all of a sudden, and me being the fool that i am reached out to her. Again we started talking, more frequently and even better than before. Dopamine leves hit me so hard. I asked her out again, she said yes.

From my perspective the date went great, we laughed, talked non-stop, there were no awkward pauses, as good as it gets. We didn't kiss as i didn't want to put that kind of pressure on her immediatly. I took her home after 5h we spent together. We texted a bit that night where we both said we had fun.

That was it. I reached out tomorrow during the day to see when is she available to meet up next time, no response for two days. I texted again yesterday, again no response.

I've been ghosted two times by this girl who i will for sure periodically see at work (thank god for remote work). And i fail to understand why..like i am really struggling to understand why, when it was that good. This is honestly the first time i've been ghosted in my life.

Couple of her possible red flags that i overlooked, that look major now: by her own words she was never in love, no meaningful romantic relationships, she's flaky (her words, we talked about it when the topic of her first ghosting came up), oftentimes even if we texted daily her responses could range anywhere between 8-10h daily (poor communication skills??)

All i know is im hurting pretty much right now. I keep thinking if maybe i kissed her that night, showed more affection it wouldve been different, maybe i teased too much.. When i asked about the first ghosting her reply was like ""Honestly there was no reason, i can sadly get like that sometimes..but when we started talking again i wanted to allow myself to get involved with someone""

Im angry and confused, any advice would be welcome.

TLDR; Texted this girl for a while, asked for a date and got ghosted. After a couple of weeks we started talkin again, more than before. This time we agreed to go out, date went pretty good with palpable chemistry. Got ghosted out of nowhere the next day and am struggling to cope",dating

She told me every guy that gets close to her she pushes away and likes guys who aren’t interested in her.  Every time we hung out she told me how much fun she had and how we need to keep doing it. I told her a couple days ago this isn’t just a short term thing for me or a fling.   Today she told me she wants to be on the same page but isn’t sure if she sees a future with me. I told her I wasn’t sure either bc I’m still getting to know her but if we continue down this path I will want something serious. After talking more she then changed and said she just doesn’t see a future with me she thinks.   So I cut it off. It just sucks bc I don’t just take a liking to anyone. I liked her.

Now retired, I enjoy a limited but generous “allowance”. I recently met a woman (70F), who I really enjoyed. She spoke of expensive trips and cars in the past, but now seemed to live a meager lifestyle. 
After finding out she had little retirement savings, I considered that a dealbreaker. If I wanted to do anything nice in the future, the cost would be double. It would eventually erode my savings and decrease the amount left for my children.

2658,Giving up on dating at 19,"I know I’m young but, every relationship I’ve attempted to make, I walk away hurt. I recently tried not wearing my heart on my sleeve but I got led on again by someone who showed genuine interest in me. 

I’ve dated a lot of people, I’ve approached girls, used dating apps, and I’m pretty good when it comes to striking up conversations and getting numbers and socials, but I feel like I’m trying too hard, and because every single relationship has led to me getting hurt in every way possible, I’m starting to question if it’s even worth the trouble. I initially thought I was the problem because of the amount of times I got led on, so I went to therapy, figured some stuff out, dated a couple more people and I still can’t seem to have anyone stay. Other times, it’s no chemistry either, and I have to be the one to end it.

I got rid of dating apps cause I live in a rural area, so there’s no options here, and I really don’t feel like becoming vulnerable to be used by girls for hookups or attention for the meantime. I’m actually starting to think that wanting a genuine relationship at my age is looked down upon, rather than just hooking up with other people. I guess it’s also my fault for continuing to talk to someone after they said they weren’t ready to be exclusive after a long time of talking and a date. I should’ve called it off then, but I didn’t and here we are, so I guess I learned something. I think what makes that worse is I knew exactly how it was gonna end.

Is it really my fault for wanting genuine connection? Is it my fault for investing feelings in? I don’t want to invest feelings too soon and too fast, but if I don’t, I emotionally wall myself off. It’s a lose-lose situation, and after all of the effort to get a “I think we’re better off as friends” that I definitely haven’t heard before, I really don’t see the point of trying anymore. I don’t even think I responded to her after I saw the text. I’m just so mad at the world and at myself for wanting a partner and people that lead others on for no reason.",dating

2662,I (M40) am a virgin and I'm reaching out to people who can relate or give advice,"I am a 40 year old male virgin. I am hetereosexual, I'm not religious, and I'm not asexual or aromantic, before anyone asks. I'm also not physically disabled, so I would be phyisically able to have sex.  
  
I know there's some stigma attached to men being virgins, and especially men my age. I assume people would like to know why, and I could give a number of answers to that.  
  
I can genuinely say that dating or hooking up was never at the front of my mind, even in my teens and twenties. I'm a social introvert and prefer staying at home to going out clubbing and drinking, so that definitely had an impact on my behaviour.  
  
I never saw a girl and thought I should talk to her with the intent of something happening between us. It genuinely never crossed my mind. I have never had an inkling of why I should flirt and it never came up in any conversations. I understood the concept of flirting, in theory, but it never crossed my mind to apply it into practice. It also never occurred to me that any girl would show that kind of an interest in me.  
  
There was an element of low self-image involved as well. For years, I had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror because I thought I was disgusting. It's over a decade since I felt that way about my own reflection, but self-doubt still lingers. I didn't like my body very much, and was worried about my weight and performance. I was also worried about my penis size, and that has stuck with me for years.  
  
Self-image and social introversion aside, I don't share myself or my inner workings with people that easily. I guess I'm a somewhat private person. I often stay in my own head, although I don't mind a stimulating 1-on-1 conversation from time to time.  
  
I have dated, you might say, although they started online and for the most part stayed online. One girl came to visit me for 10 days, and we spent that time in a bed together. She was very shy, and I was too. All we did was fool around, kiss and touch each other, but she wasn't ready for more. We'd keep in touch for a while until I stoppd hearing from her one day. Another girl showed interest in me, and yes it was online. Turns out, she experienced a great deal of trauma in her life and just shut me out one day. That was back in 2011, and I've never tried any kind of dating since then.  
  
Years back, in my 20's, I recall a time where another guy touched me in a way I wasn't prepared for. I don't know if it affected me, but I recall freezing up and not knowing how to react.  
  
Now, I guess I just wonder whether my status will affect any future relationships. I'm attracted to women, but I wonder how it will all play out in an actual sexual relationship with a woman, given my age and lack of experience. I don't know if I could even tell them, if they'd know, or if they'd feel awkward about the whole thing.",dating

Are men turned off by a certain colours of the female parts? Not all females have them in the same colour as their skin tone , some have darker, gray, pink,red and even purple, there's an specific colour that would be a turn off for you and you would consider ugly or not too appealing?

(Ps: consider it's the natural colour, it's a healthy part, no infections or STD's involved, hygiene up to date too)",dating
2664,How to date as a 19F nerd,"How am I supposed to get a nerdy bf if the majority of nerds are introverted and don't go outside? I'm 19 and have never had a bf and the loneliness is kinda setting in at this point. I love playing games and watching anime. I also collect manga and want to start collecting older game consoles. I know there's a whole community of nerdy guys so I don't think finding them is the issue, but rather finding some that aren't creepy, super antisocial, and have good hygiene. Is the dating game over for me or is there a way to work with this?",dating
2665,People not asking questions back,"Ok this might be dumb af but one of my pet hates on dating apps is when people dont ask you many questions or dont ask you the questions back that you asked, they just answer your questions like its a talk show and im the host. Im a bisexual woman and its even harder with girls, they dont ask as many questions or seem as keen to get to know me as guys do unless they are masc. is there a way i can get people to ask me back in a funny or joking way or do i just admit defeat and unmatch them? Am i being too selfish and should just be happy getting to know the other person? Im seeing a lot more posts on here about how hard dating is especially online so maybe we should all just collectively give up lol.",dating
2666,When does a man “know”?,"When does a man know he wants you to be his girlfriend? What about wife? I’m curious to some male perspective on this one?

2667,Left on delivered but for a justified reason. Do I try again?,"A while ago, I was hanging out with my friend and his cousin (the person in question) and really felt like things were hitting off, so after a day or two I talked to my friend and messaged her. I was left on delivered and got pretty discouraged until he said it was because we had both gotten out of relationships recently, and to try again in a month or so. He had talked to her about it as well, so I'm not sure if that's coming from him or from her. Well, that time has come and now I have no idea what to even say. We're all hanging out again this weekend, with some other people as well. I'm caught between not even going because I feel it will be awkward, and also wanting to go but having no idea what to say. So basically, do I go? If I do, do I try again? And if so what do I say?",dating
2668,A little dating advice,"1. If you make plans with someone to go on a date or to meet up and you txt to confirm the plans on the day before or day of and they don't respond within a hour or two? Move on. Block. Next. 

2. If you ask someone on a date or to meet up and their response is anything but a ""Hell yes!"" then it's a ""Hell no"". 

3. Some people will use you for sex without shame. If they say they aren't looking for a romantic relationship and want to be just friends tell them no thanks and leave and move on. They're just trying to let you down easy and leave the door open a crack for the possibility of a booty call when the ones at the top of the roster are busy. 

4. If you do make it to the first date and you like them just have a good time and relax. I have had great success on dates where all I did was go into it like it wasnt life or death if they wanted to see me again or not. It's not a job interview. 

5. If you're talking with someone you like don't try too hard. It shouldn't take that much work to get someone to like you I promise. Anyone I've ever really liked didn't have to do shit to get my attention. 

6. If the texting is inconsistent abandon ship. Especially over the course of a few days or weeks. Being busy is one thing but that could maybe be several hours to a day but more than that move on. I've never made anyone I'm interested in wait days for me to respond. But I have ignored guys I wasn't interested in for days. 

7. If you meet someone on OLD apps and they are telling you they're interested in meeting up or going on a date; Suggest a meet up/date as soon as possible. I feel like if you set a day and time too far out it gives the other person time to overthink and they change their minds. Plus people don't know how they're gonna feel the day of and they might not be up to it anymore.",dating
2669,I am completely lost in dating.,"Like I said yes. It's more so out of ignorance of what to do. So yeah. This sub has been an excellent pipeline to help but for the most part, I'm lost on how to get out there. Dating apps suck btw. And I'm gonna try to be open and honest about myself. \^\^'So yeah, I'll post who I am and what I seek here.  
  
I'm 23m, straight, 5'4"", and looking for just someone to hold at night and talk to in the morning. I'm not out to have a body count, I just want the sweet and wholesome stuff. what I would bring to a relationship is goofy geeky energy and home-cooked meals. That's not all but a good chunk. I am a geek that likes to cosplay and go to conventions. Like Yamacon in Pigeon Forge TN. I am mostly laid back and chill leading to me not really being as much of a dominant type, and I'm extroverted but intimately shy... Taller, stronger, smarter, and more successful women aren't something that intimidates me. In fact, are good things in my eyes actually. (Yes I kinda am into size difference)  
  
I'm a hobby-level voice actor, artist, writer, animator, and cosplayer. I like to play casual games and stuff with my friends. I am a pretty big geek and also partly nerdy. I was raised knowing construction and got to see most of the continental US besides North Dakota and Maine.  
  
The kind of relationship I want is one where we work well together like a team. I know that things in situations can get rocky and not always perfect. But that's the beauty in it all is to get through that actually. There's no such thing as perfect and it's our flaws that make us human. If you're going to be sailing your bound to run into a storm or two.  
  
At the end of the day, I want someone that's caring and reasonable. Someone to lean on and knows that they can lean back if needed. Something solid and long-lasting. I want to be someone's best and support them through good times and bad. I want someone that I can get to laugh with my corny jokes and basic humor. Someone that I can introduce to my friends and family and that wants to do the same with me and theirs. I at the end of the day want something real with someone tangible. And hopefully would like a guy that wants to cook for them. \^\^  
  
If there are any questions I am willing to answer them. So feel free to ask.  
  
Edit: Honestly, any insight you can lend me on if I seem decent is appreciated. I'm not posting this as a dating ad, this is more so to help me figure out what to do and if I seem reasonable or not. Cause I'm completely lost when it comes to dating.",dating
2670,Telling a friend of a friend you're not interested after a first date?,"I just want to preface that the reason this scenario feels different to me is *because* this person is a friend of a friend and I want to remain cool with them / make things not awkward.

I (24M) met this person through a friend around a year ago. We only ever met when out clubbing and always through that friend. I was told they liked me early on but I had no interest so I just let that information die because nothing was being pushed.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, we're all out again, we get a little close on the dance floor and we make out. Just a bit of fun in my head but then we did it again the next week. I asked them out for a date to see what I was feeling but nothing clicked for me. No crazy synergy or anything and my attraction wasn't really there. 

This person is always out on nights out, is still a lot of fun and I really enjoy the vibe so I want to try to make things not awkward. 

Any advice? 

The current plan is to straight up text something along the lines of "" I really enjoy spending time with you and I feel there's a solid friendship vibe but I wasn't feeling anything romantic between us"" .. "" I hope we can continue to have good times in the nights out to come because you're a lot of fun to hang with"". Anything there seem weird?",dating

2672,Happy to meet up and hang up but not in a romantic sense - what do they actually mean?,"Went on a first date recently and it was going OK had a few drinks and where chatting back and forth with a few slightly awkward silences. I was planning to go home ill be honest then they asked me back to their apartment. Had sex which was good and they seemed satisfied (nothing to give me the sense that it was so bad they never want to do it again, especially as it was our first time and good sex can take time). Stayed the night, didn't have sex in the morning and sensed they wanted me to leave so I did. Genuinely confused on where I stood I asked them their thoughts on meeting again. 

They said they had a really nice time, thought I was great and would be happy to hang out again but not in a romantic sense. Then said that it seems like I have a lot of friends already so to feel free to ignore them. I said I'd be happy to meet again or whatever and they asked for my number, exchanged a few messages then. 

I'm completely fine if I never see them again I just don't understand why they would suggest meeting if it was just as friends if we had sex, why not just say no I dont want to see you again. They do live alone so may be lonely which again is understandable and fine. Were they trying to let me down gently? Does not in a romantic sense mean just not dating/couple things? 

Wish people would be explicit.",dating

2676,Conflicted,"I Will try and keep this short and simple. Me and this girl work together, when she joined we hit it off and really started developing feelings for each other. Long and short because of work we couldn’t ‘officially’ date and she didn’t want to have a secret relationship, which I respected. We agreed to draw the line and see where things take us down the road, not ruling anything out but also not having an expectation. She in past relationships has been cheated on, assaulted etc so not had the best of times. Recently she told me that she has become comfortable being just friends and that she is enjoying being single, she feels like she has her indépendance back. I reminded her that I was not in this for a friendship at most. Again she reiterated that she has feelings but does not want to lose what we have now by going into a relationship and it potentially leading to us having nothing together. I took the stance of we cannot be more than co workers if she has this view and 4 days later with no contact I seen her in work and we talked. She said I was her only friend in our city and the way I went about it, even though I respected her stance and asked her to respect mine, she said I really hurt her and went about it wrong. She understands if I have to take this stance. 

We talk occasionally but I really don’t know a few things.

Since she is a glass half empty sort of person, is she just wanting friends as she doesn’t want to lose me in her life altogether (if it was to go bad) or has she genuinely friend zoned me? Is this a state of mind since she is happy being single and not looking for anything or has the deal been sealed?

Should I stand my ground and stop all contact outside of the work setting? I enjoy having her in my life but I just don’t know if I could cope with her as just a friend truly.",dating
2677,Why do women hook up with new men days/weeks before entering a committed relationship?,"It’s been my (28M) experience often that I’ll go out for drinks with a woman and a week or two later she’s posting a boyfriend on her social media or I’ll ask her out again and say she’s been seeing someone for a while and it’s getting serious. I’ve understood that the woman was dating multiple people at once but why seek new sex partners if you’re a week away from becoming serious enough to get into a relationship? I’ve always felt bad for the men in these situations and I write this post now because I recently discovered my girlfriend of 4 months did the same to me, literally the day before we became official she slept with another guy.

2678,At what point do you get vulnerable in dating someone?,"I’m starting to date again and I’m having so much trouble gauging when to start getting deep and vulnerable with the conversations. I’m generally used to dating emotionally unavailable men. I’m also not comfortable with being vulnerable. I’ve come to terms it’s not something I’ll become comfortable with until I start doing it. It’ll never come naturally to me and that’s okay but I still need to do it. My issue is I have a hard time gauging when its the right time to ask those difficult and deep questions. 

For me, the first date is just getting to know each other at a very basic level. What are their plans for the future(broad) are. I’m not really asking any deep questions. Just the basic compatibility questions like “do you want kids” etc. and is there general attraction. 

My question is when do you start initiating and asking the real deep questions like what are your your dreams, what was your childhood traumas, etc. stuff that tells you a lot about the person, the super deep stuff(without feeling like I’m prodding) This stuff does NOT come naturally to me so just waiting til the time is right DOESNT work lol. I’ve tried!! I don’t want to wait for someone to coax it out of me either bc I want to take responsibility. 

Are there general bench marks??? Do you wait til the third date??? Do you just whip out a deep question while you’re cooking together???? I genuinely don’t know how to put it into practice. I want to… it’s just totally new territory. 

Also, they’re probably well aware that I’m uncomfortable asking these questions. It’s not bc I don’t want to know. I was just conditioned to not ask those kinds of questions. So i don’t know how to be chill about it either lol 

Any advice is welcome lol

Edit: 

To make my questions clearer.. 
- how do you approach the questions?
- what questions do you ask? 
- how do I get myself to chill out when I ask these questions?? 
- how do I make the other person comfortable enough to share?",dating

2682,Newly Single (what do I do?),"Hi, new to Reddit but have read some of the posts in this category and would love some advice! 

Will start with some context. My partner ended things between us recently, I am a very driven person and have always known what I want in life. Go to Uni, get a job, save and buy a house, get a better job, save for more houses and repeat etc. I have been with my girlfriend since we were 18, I am now 24. We were in the process of looking for a house when all of this went down. She has always had difficulties with her independence and because of the way I was brought up I know what needs to be done in everyday life, whether this is laundry, cooking, cleaning, bills. I was forced to take on a parent like role for my partner, whilst I’ve always liked the feeling of somebody being dependent on me, the lack of contribution from my partner was horrendous. Because of my job and being taught to save I would pay all bills for my partner, all she had to pay was her half of the rent but I would cover all bills, groceries, take aways, dates, furniture, council tax etc, I even bought us a car I didn’t want so she could learn to drive. This isn’t me complaining because I was always happy to do this and offered, as we’d been together so long and were looking to buy a house and get married etc I was of the opinion that everything was shared. All of this would’ve been fine if we had stayed together because I saw it as making her less stressed about money and having a life we both enjoyed. 

Now comes the difficult part. What in the hell do I do? I have been with the same partner for nearly 6 years and have no idea how to date and start again, I don’t want to look for a partner, date, introduce her to family and friends, wait 3 years and buy a house together etc. I’ve been dating the wrong person for all my formative years and it’s upsetting and stressful that I could’ve done other things, dated different people. I know it wasn’t a waste because I learned lots about myself and this abrupt end has been useful to find out what I want. 

I’m worried that people won’t find me attractive and won’t want a below average dong. I bring a lot to the table in my defence, I make great money for my age (£50k + at 24), I have enough saved to buy a house on my own, I’m 6’4, great friends and family. I just don’t want to fall into the trap again of me just providing everything and repeat the same process. I know I’m young but I feel as though this is the end of my dating life  (which I know is dumb). How the hell do you even meet people in 2023? 

No hate for my ex, life’s too short to do something you’re unhappy with and I told her I respected her decision and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.",dating
2683,Still messaging after the first date but hasn’t scheduled one yet,"Had a really great first date on Friday, yes we had sex. We’ve been texting since after (I messaged him first) the effort in messages has stayed similar even though they have become a bit more sporadic (like seemingly every chance he got to 3-5 a day). I do know that he doesn’t/cannot text during work and am not expecting that. 

When he left on Saturday morning, he said he had a good time and asked if I wanted to do something soon. In our messages he’s mentioned a next time or has otherwise alluded to such a time. However we haven’t scheduled anything. Yesterday evening I sent him a message, in response to one of the allusions, asking when he thought a next time may be. 

It’s the next morning and he has yet to respond. He does start work pretty early (70/80 hr work weeks) and is switching from night shifts to day shifts rn so I get that the response times etc will change. 

For scheduling context, he asked me out the first day we were talking and picked an activity but didn’t finalize the date until the night before. That being said we went out 3 days after we started talking and we started talking on a day he had off.

I just can’t tell if he is actually interested and has things going on or is just bored and chatting. Any advice appreciated!",dating
2684,I should probably take a break from dating,Have you ever been on a date and said/did something that was so out of character for you?

2685,SEX ADVICE NEEDED,"I (24F) have had limited sexual experiences, with only one previous partner. In that relationship, whenever I was on top during penetration, my ex would reach orgasm relatively quickly, usually within 3-5 minutes. He would even ask me to switch positions to missionary if he felt he was getting too close to climax, so that he could last longer. This made me believe that I was doing something right while being on top.

However, with my current partner, I've noticed a puzzling pattern. Every time we switch to the woman-on-top position, he tends to lose his erection. I've tried various techniques like bouncing, grinding, circular motions, and different rhythms, but it consistently leads to him losing firmness.

I can count on my fingers the number of times he has orgasmed through penetration alone (note that I've given him oral sex before penetration). Most of the time, he asks me to give him oral sex or a handjob after some time of penetration, and that's when he reaches climax.  


I've been wanting to talk about this to him but I always find myself stepping back because I'm afraid things might get awkward after. What's the best way to open up a conversation about this? 

**This situation has raised several questions in my mind:** Am I not performing well enough while being on top? Is there something I'm doing wrong or not doing enough? Why does it appear difficult for him to climax during intercourse, while it's comparatively easier for him through oral sex or manual stimulation? What can I do to make him orgasm from intercourse?

And for the guys, what are some things that your girlfriends do during WOT that you enjoy the most?

I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or personal experiences you can share. Thank you!",dating
2686,I Think I Messed Up 19F,"i’m a 19F and i currently started talking to this guy 19M.

The response i was expecting was something deep, something we could talk about but instead he wanted to talk about how his ex did him dirty which threw me off.

2687,"21M Im done, I want something real - not this fake love.","Howdy folks, I’m 21M and Im more “fortunate” than most men when it comes to receiving attention from women. I’ve never had trouble finding casual relationships or flings. And in the past I would bounce around from girl to girl until I found someone who I genuinely held romantic interest in.

I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t like hookups, ONS, and flings/casual relationships always fall apart because either me or the other person catches feelings and slowly to quickly the relationship falls apart.

I want a real relationship, I want real love and affection. But the only people I seem to attract are promiscuous women - even the ones I try and settle down with whom I think are loyal and good LTR partners I’ve found out have either lied or cheated on me.

This has lead me to not trusting any woman. A man can only have his heart broken and trust shattered so many times before he swears off it entirely.

Mind you I’m very introspective and I’ve changed a lot over the years to try and attract the kind of person I want. But the double standards in dating nowadays is simply ridiculous. And why even bother trying to find someone when I know that in my experience every time I do they end up cheating on me.

I know I shouldn’t complain, and I’m at a point of privilege with the attention I receive from women. But it just hurts to be seen as just another “option” or sexual object for these people.

I just wanted to find someone I cared for, someone who could care for me the same way. And it hurts knowing I’ll probably never get that.

2691,Do you think gay dudes have lower standards for sex and dating than women do?,"Tinder, when I accidentally toggled the preferences to any instead of just women, at least 30 swipes from dudes shot in within a day. Usually I only get around 10 or 15 a day from women.

Another huge factor is that the men that swiped on me were really really good looking. I'm talking Calvin Klein model type shit. Half of the guy dudes on there were looking for something serious, the other half something casual. If you're wondering why I looked into their profile if I'm not interested in men, it's because I wanted to know out of curiosity from the men thag are into me, what sort of dudes are interested in me. 

In real life, I've been cold approached by a dude two times in public asking if I'm into men, which I'm assuming is implying they found me attractive. I've never been approached by a girl though.

On reddit, I made a post on a sub with my face in it and got a FOURTEEEEN DMs from men, most of which were pretty direct and flirty which sorta stroked my ego, but it left me wondering with all this what's up since I've never had a girl slide in my dms on reddit. 

Do you all think men have lower standards for men than women have for men? Maybe I just look a certain way that men find especially attractive or maybe there some other factors at play.

2694,I (27f) cannot get a date and I feel like something is wrong with me.,"I had a nasty breakup two years ago. One cheating ex, few horrible things said, long story short I was a mess and single for the first time in awhile. I took a year to work on me. I knew I needed to work on myself and fall in love with my life again. I spent time with my family, friends, and went to therapy. 

Finally I felt like I was able to get back out there. I joined the apps, was not shy of matches but conversations either never went past the initial message or just died in general. No problem, so I turned to meeting people out. Actually met who I thought was a nice guy out, we talked for a couple weeks planned a date, day comes and I was ghosted. Slight ego blow but I took some time, hopped back on the apps and it was all the same bs as before so I found myself deleting them. Last month, met a guy at my gym. We talked, things seemed great, tried to plan a date but the timing wasn’t really working out that week so he totally gave up. Stopped responding to my messages and stopped coming to the gym. I’ve now returned to the apps and I’m not meeting anyone worthwhile. I’ve sent plenty of likes, no responses. People I do match with don’t respond. 

I just don’t get how people do this. I’ve been told I’m pretty attractive, I don’t have an issue getting matches just getting people to answer. But the thing is it’s starting to kill my ego/confidence and I don’t know how to fix that.",dating
2695,How to break up without hurting her too much ?,"I have been with this girl for around two years, she is totally in love with me, she tells me how being with me made her a better, stronger and more confident person, but the thing is I am not in love with her anymore.

but I stay with her because I am scared of how much I could break her if I leave. But I feel I can't do this forever and I want to be with someone who I am in love with as much as they love me. 

So rn I don't know how to break up with her in a way that'll let her down easy",dating
2696,I feel so lonely even though I usually enjoy being alone,"I am a 22F in my third year on Uni (molecual biology major), soon approaching my 4th year. I live in a dorm with my high school friend who I've known for 11 years now. She is asexual I am bisexual. I dare to say she is more anxious person than me because I have been trying really hard to work on my anxiety while she just tries to avoid it as much as possible. I love her I try to help her as much as I can but I can't say she is able to do the same for me which is something I accept given her issues. What I really liked was that I could talk to her about everything but I can't tell her about this.

A year ago she was approached by a boy during a field trip and they started dating. She's been with him for a year now and they meet up like once a week. I don't mind her talking to me about him because she is my friend and I always try to be here for her. But whenever she talks about him my heart hurts. We have two more friends from High school, one got boyfriend since her 1st year on Uni and the other one now went on a few dates with a boy her mom matched her with a few weeks ago. All of them talking about these experiences together is something that just hurts me so much and I can't talk to anybody about this pain. My grand-aunt and my mother keep telling me to find someone too and the more I hear anyone talking to be about relationships I hurt so much. I mean I can feel my heart and my soul physically hurting and I just want to hide somewhere and cry. 

I am from a family where I had to learn to count on myself very early on. I was emotionally and mentally abused for years. Being alone was something I got used to very quickly and most of the times I prefer to be alone because I can do things I like without anyone judging me or telling me that I like stupid things.

But lately being alone always makes me fall into these feelings of loneliness. It makes me feel like I am missing out on my young years. I was dating a girl during my 2nd year on Uni and I broke up with her after a month because she is asexual and I just need more physical closeness than she would be comfortable with. I tried tinder but I have a few very important things I need in a person and I can't seem to find that person. One more problem is that I am a virgin and when I finally feel like I could click with someone they just want to rush into sex and I can't really provide that yet. I mean I am open to try things and get closer but I need time to actually get comfortable with that person so sex after only meeting 2 times is really not for me. Tbh because of many guys I met on tinder I am starting to feel ashamed of being a virgin but I just want to meet someone who is more special for me not just a one-night-stand.

I just got a part-time job in a lab for this summer and if my training goes well they want to keep me there during the semester as well. It was hard to approach the lab and go for an interview because my anxiety just always acts up but I made it and I am really happy I did. I have to start working on my bachleor's thesis that I have been putting off for a long time now because I'm really worried to start as I hate making mistakes but I know I have to start and I really want to work on myself. I am very self-aware person but these feelings about loneliness are something I just have hard times understanding because as I said I usually don't mind being on my own but lately it has really been painful.",dating

2698,Sexual tension off the charts,"Hi! 
I (22f) just met a guy (25m) on a dating app. I saw him for the first time two weeks ago and we had a really pleasant first date. 

He was traveling for the last two weeks but still planned our date right after leaving the airport. 

Then yesterday we had a second date. The sexual tension was off the charts. I couldn’t keep my hands to myself and neither could he. We watched a movie and listened to music and I had to push him back a few times while making out because we definitely would have ended in the bedroom. I was very clear about the fact that I wanted to wait longer to have sex and he was very understanding. But then, out of nowhere I’d find myself on top of him and he’d be grinding on me. 
We went as far as dry humping and he bit my nipples… Anyway, I’ve never experienced this before. 
And, he’s bringing me on a third date tonight. 


I’m just scared this will make him only interested in sex. 
We discussed the option of waiting longer (3 months to be exact) and he looked fairly disappointed. I do not have the intention to wait 3 months, but I’m worried once we have sex, he won’t want to see me again or he’ll get some form of post nut clarity. 
The first time I had sex with my ex, he distanced himself. He stopped talking and the next day, he called me back saying he wanted to see me again. He told me usually he detaches himself after sex whether he thinks the girl has dating potential or not and the reason he called me back is because he still enjoyed our time together after sex. Ive been worried since then that a guy will realize he’s not into me after sex. 

Any advice or opinion would be very appreciated!
Thank you!!

TLDR: The sexual tension was off the charts on the second date. I’m worried he’ll have post but clarity and not want to see me after sex.",dating
2699,On-line dating,I've been talking to a guy for about a week and a half and he asked to meet up. He said he'd like to go for lunch and I said can we meet for a drink in the evening instead.

2700,Is this normal?,"My boyfriend and I have been together a little over a year, and if I accidentally do something that makes him jealous or hurt he will do the same to me.

What he will do is make sure to find someone on reddit and do the same thing except make it obvious he was flirting. One time I sent my ex a song so he did it s bunch of times to his ex. It just goes on and on. Just recently he got upset and gave me the silent treatment for a couple days and I couldn't even find out if he was breaking up with me or just mad. We have a very close relationship and his last girlfriend was very manipulative,  his ex was very petty like that. I told him no more! He needs to communicate instead of doing such childish things. I just wanted to know if this was a normal thing? Is this something anyone else has dealt with? Thank you in advance!",dating

My life is way more stressful than it was before we started dating and I can’t keep living this way. The dilemma I’m facing is that we are supposed to go to the beach with her family tomorrow night or Saturday morning. I really don’t want to go at all but I feel like it’s a bad time to break up with her cause she would go on vacation with a broken heart. I know there is no good time to end things, but I don’t know if I should just suck it up and go or end it tonight when I see her. My mother says it would be cruel to break up with her before her vacation and go with a broken heart, so I’m torn. Advice would be great!

TLDR; I want to break up with my girlfriend but we are going on vacation with her family this weekend and I feel stuck.",dating

2705,Are very women attractive women intimidating? Discourages men from approaching?,"29F.

I’m very aware that I’m attractive, and I mean this in the least cocky way. I’m not that kind of person. 

I go to the gym 5 times a week, own a house, have a excellent job and degree. I wonder if all of these traits add to intimidation as well?

I have run into so many times guys that ask me out,  blatantly tell me they don’t want to “do too much” because they “ know a bunch of guys are on me”. There’s always an assumption I deal with this rotation of men, and that they practically throw themselves at me.

In public I get hit on from time to time, but for the most part I notice stares but they don’t always actually approach.

I’m not trying to come off as a vain self centered POS. Please don’t take it that way. I’m truly trying to see what goes through a guys mind when they see an attractive woman. Is it intimidating? Is it not intimidating? Would like some male perspective here.",dating

The first date was really good, we had a good time and it ended up us staying the night in hotel. During the time we were having sex, she'd stop randomly and push me away and say stuff like ""You're going to block me after this aren't you?"" or ""You just want a quick fuck"" and stuff like that. But, she was the one who offered to go to hotel and do whatever we were doing. I assured her that I wasn't like that. The sex was amazing, probably the best I ever had in my short life, and I ended up finishing in her after she told me to. We slept, got out of the hotel in the morning and got some breakfast and I took her home.
Afterwards, we texted here and there. We both worked a lot so it wasn't very constant. She was very excited to come to my place this week, which is almost hour and a half away. I was very excited too, it was planned and everything and suddenly she just stopped talking to me. The thing that doesn't make sense is, she never gave me the impression that she doesn't like me. She was very into me, online or offline, and that drawn me to her a lot. We are on the same wavelength, and I fall for people who shows affection to me very easily. Even the last text she sent was to make sure I ate or not, but after that she vanished. She unfollowed me on Instagram, and didn't see my text at all. I sent her a follow-up text a day later, but no response. I sent her a text directly, but no response. I know she has been active, but it doesn't make sense to me that why she'd do it. I have never been ghosted before, and tbh it kind of hurts because we really got on well together. What is actually going on? I just can't find anything that I did wrong or anything that I felt off, it was just too perfect to end like this. Please help me with any perspective you have🙏

2712,Completely confused after amazing two dates,"Joined hinge after a very long old relationship (last 2 years married - finalised the divorce about 3 months ago). Matched with this guy and then we set up a date to meet in the park. He also mentioned that he was getting out of a long term relationship. We connected very well on common interests, the conversation was very free flowing - the date felt almost surreal. He drove me around for a bit and offered to drop me home. He was respectful and asked if he could hold my hands and if he could kiss me at the end of the first date. We kissed - it was great and he texted after.

We set up another date at his place where he suggested we cook together. He was responsive and sweet in his texts leading up to the meeting. The second date went very well - we cooked a great meal, listened to music, I bonded with his cat, had amazing sex ( I thought so at least because we went at it twice). He tends to have a busy schedule so looked tired - we were also drunk and high - and he mentioned how I should be getting back as he needed to drive home the next day early in the morning. I was a bit taken aback an said it was fine and left shortly. The goodbye wasn’t too great.

The next morning I told him what a great night I had but also mentioned that I would have liked him to be upfront about the boundaries he has so I can plan better - like getting home late at night when I’m drunk and high. He respectfully acknowledged it. I decided to keep the conversation going. The next day I asked him if he would like to go watch a movie next week but he said was too busy this week and would probably be free the week after. I wished him luck for the week ahead and our text chain ended at him wishing me the same.

I felt very lucky to meet him - had a wonderful time on both our dates but now I’m quite confused. I’m not sure where we stand am afraid to take another step forward. We both had agreed that we wanted something short term at the moment but I don’t quite know what it means.

My intuition is telling me that he wasn’t just using me for sex given the depth of our conversation. Looking for an outside perspective to understand what to do next",dating
2713,Met the weirdest girl ever (rant),"A few weeks ago, this girl hit me up on this dating app. She was very good looking, awesome conversationalist with a nice bit of sass (dig it) & incredibly sweet. I haven't been on a date in over 2 years because life has been difficult & I've been focusing on my happiness & self-improvement; wasn't seriously looking because I barely get any matches & when I do...I usually just get ghosted or rejected. 

So a week of just flirty messages goes by & she is very forward and asks to hang out. I'm taken by surprise because I have low expectations...so I let her know that I've put on a little bit of weight & haven't been super stable & whatnot, haven't seen anyone in over 2 years.. She gave me an incredibly sweet & thoughtful response --basically saying she doesn't mind a bit of fluff, she hasn't seen anyone in a year, etc.-- and still wanted to see me. At this point I'm like, I couldn't even get rid of this girl if I tried...so maybe this might be different? So she drives to see me & meets me at my apartment. Her vibe was so totally different. She had pigtails, super dolled up, & was very blunt and almost aggressive. She seemed kind of unsure about me & sized me up. She starts talking about how sketchy my apartment is, talks about how my car is junk ...& like...fair points & it's funny so whatever! I take her for a long ride & the conversation is really good. Then she starts talking about her ex-boyfriend from a year ago. She gets really into shit-talking him...saying he gained weight (which i thought she was cool with?) and she would pity fuck him and was disgusted by him. Said that she didn't approve of his finances & the house he bought was a small shack. She goes on to say that she broke up with him & the guy was so ridiculous that she thought he might hurt himself over it. I was just kind of shocked at that point but trying to play it cool; she asks about my ex & I gave her a little run down but said I dont really want to say much out of respect for them. She proceeds to talk about this guy she fucked on a cruise a few weeks ago, & then how she has been messing around with this 40 year old now because he has a big dick (all of which goes against what she said in messages?).  I'm just there like....lol wtf is going on...this girl is fucking with me & clearly has no interest? The date goes on for like 6 hours & she makes even more red-flag comments...like how she hates men, she doesn't want a power imbalance in a relationship, she has to be the pretty one, etc... I'm here like having no idea what to think. I bring her back to her car, she initiates a hug (no way was i trying a kiss in a parking lot after all of that) and we say our goodbyes. 

The next day, she hits me up with messages, saying that she really enjoyed herself & wants to go on another date. I'm like....uhhh...ok, thinking with the wrong part of my body & thinking ""maybe she was just awkward or something"". So we keep talking. I hint at getting a date going but she says that she's going alone to her cabin...so I dont want to bother her. She starts not responding as quickly so I begin to kind of distance myself & never text back unless she replies. This sort of weird game of cat and mouse continued until last night...where I basically just came out and asked what she wanted from me. She said that she isn't really interested in me anymore. I dig into it a bit & she said that she doesn't like how my teeth are yellow (I have a lack of enamel since birth) & she had all of these other guys asking her out on dates & I didnt. She then says that she wants to be friends for now...to which I reply...yea, there's no for now...if we are friends, we are friends and that is it. This seems to take her by surprise & she says that she said for now because that there's a lot of things that she likes about me but I'm a work in progress. Basically ended the conversation with a goodnight & made sure I was the last one to say it...because I dont plan on messaging this girl again. 

Now I'm all kind of fucked up thinking about my teeth lol. I really have no idea what her intentions were with me....did she see ""weakness"" and decided that I would be fun to mess with but she didn't get the right reaction? She did talk a lot about having a psychology degree and messing with people. But yea...feels like a cruel joke given that my 1st date in over 2 years is to this...ummm...person?",dating

There is a guy I've known only from social media.
We went to the same college. He moved abroad and it so happens that I was visiting the city he lives in

He suggested to meet up. I agreed.
Before we met he found me on the dating app, matched with me and said that he wants to meet. He never mentioned dating.


We met, he invited me for dinner and paid for everything. Also wanted to call the taxi for me to get back home. Problem is he is a very friendly guy and I think that that's just how he is.

Couple days later I asked if we can meet again, he agreed and he invited me for dinner and paid again.

During our conversation he said that likes dark haired women (I'm not). He said he hoped I will find someone in the city I live in currently. I wished him the same. He mentioned all his past girlfriends. He was really open about everything.


I'm leaving the country now but realised I really fancy that guy. Do you think he is interested? Should I text him saying that I do? Nothing will happen probably but I feel like I want to get it out of my system.... Would that be too creepy? 

Update : 
I sent him another message saying sorry for sending that.

He sent a brilliant reply and now we're friends again. Actually I now realise why I had the feelings, basically it's because he went through similar things I went through.

Now that I've calmed down it males sense and he handled it very well. Actually really happy to know this person.

2718,why doesnt talking things out never work,"My boyfriends birthday is tomorrow and money is tight. My boyfriend bought me tickets to see my favorite artist and an hotel  because by the time I’ve moved into my own apartment I barely had any money left to wipe my ass with a towel then, a few days later, he had gotten into a fatal car accident where he was the only survivor. 

He doesn’t talk much about it, but I’m sure it’s taken a toll on him mentally and due to the injuries he sustained during it, he missed out on work and that of course put a financial strain on him as well. As for me I missed 2 days of work to be by his side and take care of him, I even helped him shower and feed him while I knowingly had my own responsibilities I had to take care of like rent, Wi-Fi and etc. 

Once my check came in, I spent it all on my bills and Afterpay the gifts that I could…

Fast forward to now, upon our first discussion of his birthday he through a fit because he seen a problem with me wanting to celebrate at my apartment. I didn’t tell him what I was gonna do because it was a surprise, but ideally due to my financial situation I was gonna decorate my apartment with roses, balloons, bag his gifts and cook him his favorite meal. I even have lingerie and a spicy game lined up. 

As of today, his birthday is tomorrow and he had hurt my feeling because I offered cheap entertainment and alcohol until his day and he simply responded “I’m not staying in the house drinking on my birthday,” hurt I didn’t say much. I took a shower and cried a little because I felt like I was disappointing him even before he knew what I had planned. Because I am the type to shut down during the argument I made sure to take the time feel my emotions and address him after. When I came back he was unaware of my hurt feelings and I tried to sit down and talk about how what he said made me feel. 

He stated I took it out of context and got mad and said I was making my birthday about him and making stuff up in my head and that he was saying he didn’t have a problem with staying in, he just wasn’t gonna drink. But I knew what he was saying — before giving up on the conversation explained that maybe I am making things up and still hurt about his prior words so what he said rubbed me the wrong way and just being would’ve liked some reassurance. He said he wasn’t go comfort me because “I’m making things up in my head.”

2720,"Saw an ex from a couple months ago I'm still in love with on Hinge. Is the ""I have nothing left to lose, I should send her a rose"" approach viable?","Backstory: In March I (36/m) met a girl on Hinge and it was quite literally the most swept off my feet feeling I've ever experienced in my life. The entire time we were staring into each other's eyes, smiling, laughing, asking each other a million questions. Somehow the 2nd date was even more magic than the first one. For the first time in my life, I genuinely felt like I found ""the one"". 

Fast forward to the end of March and we go out on our 3rd date, this time her coming over, and she's much lower energy than I've seen her before. I internally start to panic and get really nervous that I'm fucking things up. She picks up on all the anxiety I'm projecting and gets uncomfortable. She leaves early and the next day ends things because she ""can't date someone so self-centered"".

I end up going to therapy again and start working on myself afterwards and I do not contact her at all during this time.  Last Friday, for the first time, I broke the no contact rule and send her an I Think You Should Leave clip parodying her favorite show The Bachelorette. She responds positively but her replies are very spaced out. We exchange only a few messages just lightly talking about that show, with the last message being her leaving a short reply 12 hours later. I figured the 12 hour reply was her expressing disinterest so I didn't respond.

This morning I opened up Hinge and in the standouts section, I see her with a brand new profile. Is it worth trying to send a rose with a funny/witty message at this point? Do I have anything to lose or is this a bad idea?",dating

I fine alone , I'm surviving but it sucks. I've been sleeping without a goodmorning and a goodnight , there's no one who i could speak my heart out to irl. Don't get me wrong i am tough and shit but still.... I've lost the ability to make bonds , all i see is redflags and i move away from them. I go for bike rides alone with my blunt cause idk what else and who else i could take , i do have friends but I don't talk like that to my friends , i mean they don't know this weak side of mine.....

I don’t feel giddy about a new relationship I don’t feel like anything has changed. He’s super sweet and our values align for what we want for the future. For background I am a fearful avoidant person so I alpt of the times self sabotage relationships when people get close. I thought I would have a spark or giddiness but all I feel is indifference with a spark of unease.

He told me one of them was forcefully married to a girl in countryside under gunpoint and they're not together but the girl keeps asking for money and is denying divorce as he pays her lumpsumps at once. About the other guy he said that he committed a crime and somebody else is in the prison for him. Both these secrets are enough to ruin anyone's life but I'm personally someone who has questionable amount of acceptance. I said its their past and people have dark pasts and that's about it. A week ago he cheated on me, I found out he'd been flirting with females on a dating app for the past week. I found out through the girls he started following on Instagram.He told me he had never even  had a talking phase w someone ever in 24 years of his life, but I recently found out he had a female in his life whom he liked but she only used him for getting his friend.He had previously lied multiple times but I only recently discovered the truth. I got a random thought in my head that it is completely possible that both these secrets belong to him and he just tagged his bestfriends name so it would be easier to share because humans tend to do so, I'm a psychology major so I have a different perspective here. do you think it's possible? and could there be a way to get assurity for the same?",dating

2732,Giving up,"After today, I'm forced to accept that I will live and die without ever achieving romantic love.

We started chatting over Discord. She got sexual real fast. I told her I was a virgin, and she didn't care. I responded by asking if she wanted me to book a hotel, since we're several hours away from each other. She said yes. We talked for two weeks, did some calls, watched TV, and things seemed good.

Today we went on a date. I was an anxious mess, nothing I did or said went right, and she didn't seem particularly pleased. She left before we could spend the night, saying she only had platonic feelings for me. I told her I understood and thanked her for meeting me.

I've been dating for ten years. It never gets easier or better. I quit. I am going to drink, do whatever else I need to do, and wait to die slowly of whatever will kill me before I ever date again, because I can't have what I want. I need to live with the fact I will never, ever get what I need.

This post is tagged Support Needed because there's no venting tag. I know someone will inevitably shit on me for some reason I can't fathom, and others will offer encouragement. Either way, it's of no use.

Yes I'm a virgin, no I'm not asexual or a Christian, let's not explore that any further.

EDIT: So tired. Got up at 6:30 AM, drove four hours to get home, cleaned, got stoned too early in the day, had a bad reaction, and now I'm better but exceedingly tired.

2733,Emotional connection but no physical attraction,"So I'm curious about other people's experiences with this. 

I was in a situationship with someone (which I feel I should have ended much earlier) but our emotional connection was amazing. But I never found her physically attractive and I feel because of that I considered her more of a friend than develop the romantic feelings.

And on the other hand, there have been times where I've found someone physically attractive but hated their personality that I stopped finding them attractive.

But sometimes this makes me feel shallow as I'm judging woman on their appearances which you can only change up to a certain extent. Recently this has made my confidence take a hit and I've realized how on dating apps so many woman must be judging me solely on looks and not giving my personality a chance.

What have you experience been regarding this especially if you mainly try to date through dating apps.",dating
2734,Unintentional great night - with a friends older sister…,"Have quite the interesting situation unfolding on me. Could use some advice and wisdom.

A couple of weeks ago I recently asked a long term family friend to join me as a +1 at a work event fundraiser. She and I have been friends for close to 15 years now because her younger brother and I were great friends for over a decade and I’ve helped her unconditionally with anything she needs. (Truck getting stuck, moving, shoveling snow etc) she has also been extremely supportive of me. I used to date her roommate and recently she has helped me through my very fresh divorce. (My wife walked out of our relationship earlier this year, papers are currently being finalized) Her and I are both in the real estate industry and can often pass referrals to one another. This dinner was a great opportunity for the both of us to get our names out in the community and honestly to just have a fun night.

Fast forward to the night of event, her and I are all dressed up and taking pictures together before dinner. We had numerous people ask us how long we’ve been married… which we both chuckled at and said we’re not together, we’re just long time friends. Well as the night progressed we ended up going out for drinks following the event with some other people we met at the event. We stayed out all night and she began to slowly start leaning into me, holding my arm whenever we changed locations, grabbing my thigh occasionally. She even at one point said “I hope you know that if you ever wanted to be sperm donor I think we could make a beautiful kid”… we shut down the bar and began walking back to my car so I could drop her off at her place and I could get back home. She grabbed my hand and held it until we made it back to my car.

As we pull into her neighborhood she asks me if I would come inside with her. I told her yeah I can certainly chat for a minute as I was thoroughly  enjoying our time together. We ended up chatting on her couch till 4:30am about all sorts of thing during which we were very physically entangled. Legs interlocked etc. we ended up half asleep on the couch when she asked me to join her and make our way to her bedroom. We both promptly passed out, not cuddling but certainly touching. We didn’t have sex but obviously slept together. 

We woke up late the next day, went and got breakfast together and reminisced about the night we had. Seriously one the most fun nights I’ve had in such a long time. We both agreed to wanting to do stuff like that more often. We even talked about going swing dancing together in the next couple of weeks.

Looking back at the series of events in starting to wonder if she wanted to take things beyond what happened. I’m horrible at reading cues and was trying to figure out if there was chemistry there or if she wanted me to make a move on her for sex….

I’m also very torn because of her brother was a long term friend, we’ve been best buds since highschool but have since grown apart due to my divorce drama. I had no intentions of the night transpiring this way but given my life circumstances I decided to just go with the flow and see what happens.

Am I overthinking this? Is my date actually interested in me? Should I have asked her about having sex? Should I continue going and doing events and swing dancing with her?",dating
2735,"[29M] Lots of first dates, never kissed, no second dates","Ok guys, this is ridiculous already.

I'm 29. I went on my very first first date last year, just after turning 28. During this time I went on 16 first dates. 2/3 of them were actually really boring, several others were better, some others were ok but I didn't see it going anywhere.

There were others, 4 or 5 maybe that were really good and I actually felt a thing going on.

Last one, we spent like 5 hours at a bar. I walked her home and we talked for about another hour. I think I did want to kiss her, and she might have been ok with it.

But I can't for the life of me make a move or anything. I've never kissed anyone, I don't know how it works, I'm note sure if she's into it. I'm terrified of screwing things up.

I've never even been on a second date, ever. I may not be sure at the end of the first date, but if she accepts to go out a second time, maybe something happens, who knows. 

I think maybe the reason I don't get second dates is precisely because I don't make a move on the first one so Wtf do I do?

2738,27M - Sexually inexperienced and wondering how to address,"**TLDR: Had sex in a very long relationship, but very, very vanilla and feel almost like a virgin. How to address sexual inexperience as I seek new relationships?**

6 months ago, I saw a relationship end with a woman I started dating as a teenager. I am 27, so it was a very long relationship. I experienced a torrent of insecurity following the breakup, but am largely over that now, and feel ready to get back out there.

The thing is, she was my first and only sexually, and I was hers as well. I think largely due to this, our sex life was incredibly vanilla, and I mean really, really vanilla. Like one position, little foreplay, no oral on either end (lots of this was due to a lack of passion, which caused the breakup). Suffice to say, even though I've had sex probably over a thousand times, I feel as if I have very little experience. I half-hooked up with one person shortly after the breakup, who basically told me I was bad at foreplay in as nice a way as she possibly could - we didn't go further than foreplay.

My question is - how do I address this as I get back out there? I don't think people expect this from me as I'm a pretty good catch on paper (6'0"", genuinely quite handsome and sociable, good job/income, feminist, good shape, etc.) and present as really normal. I've had little issue matching with women I could see a connection with on apps, but I've just been too nervous to meet up. I'm worried they'll think I'm just bad in bed when it comes to it, and that we just lack sexual compatibility. I really just need some experience/exploration, but people don't assume that of a normal-presenting 27 year old man.

This is a pretty open-ended question, but I'm wondering how you'd address this in my situation? I'm open to hook-ups to gain experience, but that's not really my ultimate goal. I'd really like to explore sexually with someone I feel connected to, but don't want to ruin a great connection with sexual incompatibility (if it was avoidable).

Thanks all for the input",dating

Is that a deal breaker?",dating
2740,"Hey there, Hot Stuff…","I know you’ll never see this letter, and I suppose I should be grateful for that, but I still feel so stupid for writing it. Stupid because there’s no reason my feelings should be this strong and my heart should hurt this badly. We were only talking for a few short weeks but, man, I fell HARD and I fell FAST.  But now it’s all over and I’m left here to pick up the pieces.  I’m sure you’re happy with her, and that’s great. I want you to be happy. But I want to be happy too.  So, in an attempt to help heal my broken heart, I just wanted to write down (almost) all the things I’ll never get to say:

-When you first messaged me after we matched for the 4th time in as many years, you said “the universe just wants us to be together.”  I responded by saying “and who are we to tell the universe it’s wrong?”  Well, we called the universe’s bluff and now I feel like I’m the one paying the price for it.  You get to move on and fall in love and I get to sit at home, too afraid to go out anywhere in case I run into you. If I need to drive through your neighborhood to get somewhere, I’ll take a longer route just to avoid the possibility of seeing you. 

-I still walk the dog on that nature trail and by the park where we had our first date. I feel safe there because you didn’t know it existed before I told you about it, and there’s a very slim chance you’ll ever go back. It’s the dog’s favorite route to walk along though, so I still take him every day after work. But it breaks my heart to be there because all I can think of is you, and our conversation, and the way my head rested perfectly on your chest when we hugged because you’re so tall, and the way your lips felt pressed against mine.

-the dog is on a diet and I hate that every time I feed him, the sound of kibble and chicken falling into his bowl is replaced with your laughter as you said “aww no look at him, he ain’t missing no meals!” He was wary of you, but oddly enough I think he misses you. When we pass by someone on our walks that looks even remotely like you, his tail will wag uncontrollably and he tries to jump on them. He still growls a bit, but he just seems sad when he realizes it’s not you. I do too. 

-I hate doing laundry now because doing laundry means I need to open the closet door where the washer and dryer are. The same door you picked me up and pressed me up against, my legs wrapped around your waist, when you did everything you could to turn me into putty in your hands. I want to pull those doors off the hinges so I don’t have to look at them every day. 

-You ruined chocolate chip cookies for me. They were my favorite midnight snack and now all I think about is baking late-night, post-sex cookies with you. I’ve been fortunate to live my entire life without any allergies, but now it feels like just one cookie will kill me. Even when I pass by the pre-made dough in the grocery store, I can feel my heart constrict and my throat close up. 

-You ruined Star Wars for me. I thought it was so cute how you, a chemistry nerd, never saw the penultimate nerd series. I was excited for our plans to have a movie marathon. I was excited to show you to the galaxy. Now I stop the microwave before the timer hits 0:00 because it sounds like R2-D2 and it makes me lose my appetite. 

-I bought new lingerie I was hoping to surprise you with. It arrived in the mail after we stopped talking. I can’t even force myself to try them on to make sure the sizes are correct. They’re just sitting in a drawer with the tags still on, collecting dust. I used to feel sexy and confident in my underwear. Now I feel like a sheepish little girl, too afraid to undress in the locker room before PE class. 

-I told you I didn’t want kids, and that only one man in my entire life truly made me consider starting a family, but that he hurt me so badly I was completely sworn off. That was a lie. Maybe not at first, but it became a lie. When I found out you had a kid, after the shock and hurt subsided, after you spoke of how much you love your child, there was a second man I could see holding my child in his arms. You. A gorgeous little creature who would be the best parts of you and me put together. Now I fear that if I ever have children, I’ll resent them because they won’t be half of you. 

-I hate that every time I see a car like yours, my heart skips a beat. I almost got into an accident the other day because I thought I passed you on my way into town. I’m afraid to drive now because all I do is look out for your car, wondering if you’re looking out for mine. 

-I hate how deeply I care about you, and how I wish you nothing but the purest love and happiness. I hate that I can’t hate you. It would all be so much easier if I hated you. I wouldn’t be hurting so much. I could chalk this all up to the fact that you’re an asshole. A player. You used me and threw me away. But that’s not you. You’re kind and caring and gentle and, if I had only given us a proper chance, I could have known what it would feel like to be truly loved by you.

-I hate that I swallowed my pride and apologized, when I honestly didn’t have much to apologize for, only to be met with silence. My pride was all I had left, and now that’s gone too. And I especially I hate how pathetic and desperate this all sounds. After my last serious heartbreak, I put so much time and effort into myself, and I reminded myself that I am amazing and anyone is lucky to have me. Now I’m back to apologizing for using up oxygen. 

-I hate that I believed you when you said you still wanted me, desired me, even though I could feel the distance between us growing larger. And I hate that now you’re so cold, so indifferent. I hate that you act like it was all just in my head. Even if it was, I wish you would just say that instead of leaving me with radio silence. It would be easier to understand that maybe I really am just obsessive or crazy, than to be left wondering how it all went wrong. But I know there’s nothing to wonder about. You said that if you didn’t want to talk to me, you wouldn’t. It appears you are a man of your word. I just wish I took you at your word when I still had the chance. 

-You said I don’t know you or understand you, and I hate that you’re right. I hate that you don’t know or understand me either. We never gave each other the chance to. And I hate that we’ll probably never get that chance again. 

-I want you to be happy, and I hope she does make you happy. But, like I said, I want to be happy too. I want to be with you. I want to hear your laugh again, see your perfect smile again, hear your heart beat as I lay on your chest again. I want to feel you in me again, holding me tightly. I want to sit on the swing with you, my legs across your lap as I listen to you tell me all your wildest stories. I want to feel your lips press against my forehead as you slip out of bed. I just want to feel like you care again. Even if it was all in my head. 

I know we may never speak again, but I want you to know that I will always want you. And I hate that. But I don’t hate you. Not even a little bit. 



Yours, always.

2742,(just sharing/no advice needed). Just had a really bad date,"So, i (m18) matched with a woman (f18) on bumble a few days ago. We had a really good convo and seemed to have a lot in common and needless to say, it was flowing great. she seemed eager to talk to me and was actually trying to get too know me. 

we moved things to number and talked for about two more days and eventually we decided to meet earlier..awful, just awful

she literally couldn’t find me when i was at the other end of the street. i had to watch her car drive from one section of my apartment complex to another and then pulling out and back in to the complex, and then drove around in circles, all while i was standing at the end when i was on the phone with her. i was giving her very basic, simple instructions and she just..couldn’t follow them. She also didn’t have knowledge about a lot of basic things..for example i asked her if her car was a sedan or SUV so i could flag her down and she straight up said “idk.” great. 

well, i get in the car and we drive to this breakfast place to get coffee and..awkward. we talked for a bit and whatnot but the convo wasn’t flowing very well.

when we got there, that’s when i officially wanted to leave. she fumbled with her hands the entire time while we were at the restaurant, was actively AVOIDING eye contact and not talking. at all. if i asked a question i got a mumbled, one word response and she just looked away. 

afterwards we drove to a thrift store cus she wanted to look at vinyls and the entire time i tried to make convo or suggest an album to her..silence. one word responses and shaking her head and going “mhm.” when we left the store she walked out and slammed the door right in my fucking face without looking back. 

finally she took me home, i awkwardly left and texted her how i truly felt, letting her know this was quite uncomfortable for me. no response, nothing. which is fine with me. but wow. worst experience ever",dating
2743,"Currently in the ""Not ready for a relationship"" situation with a guy.","Hey y'all,

Me \[25M\] met a guy \[30M\] a few weeks ago and we hit it off very well. Our first meet went very well, we got to know each other and we even planned out our summer due to how well we clicked and how similar we are. We understood how we felt, we knew how to communicate and we enjoyed each other's company.

On the second time when we met, we already acted as if we're a couple, rejecting other people by stating that we're in a relationship, and even acting as one in public. We already had a lot of deep talks, we held each other's arms as we talked about situations that were in our heads but not true, and we never made each other feel bad about how we felt or what was in our heads. We were basically meeting like 3 times a week, and I loved every second of it.

Now, after just 2 weeks he told me that wants to have distance from me, because he started catching feelings for me, but isn't ready for a relationship as he recently got out of a multiple year one where he was about to propose to his partner. Now the worst part is that he did tell me that he's still not entirely over the breakup as he didn't get any closure and it's eating him from the inside. But he did say he never wants to be with that person again due to how toxic the said person was. 

When he first informed me, I already told myself that I will not catch feelings for him because I know the risk is too high. Of course, my heart knows better than my mind, because I was hurting like crazy for the past week, as he was exactly the type of person that has been in my mind for as long as I can remember, and I loved spending time with him as well as everything he gave me. He made me realize just how lonely I am because of the attention he gave me, and the way he talked to me. He made me feel valuable!

When we talked it through, he did say that he doesn't know how long his healing journey will take and if he will want to be with me once he's ready, or if someone else will be in his heart, but I'm very happy that he was honest, as we do indeed not know what the future holds. And even though he didn't say that he will be with me once he's ready, I am still sitting on that slight hope, whilst also telling myself that he will find someone who he thinks has better compatibility.

I'm feeling better then last week, but every now and then he creeps into my mind, which makes my stomach have that twist feeling.

I hope my post can be relevant to someone, and hope that the comments will also help me out as well as people in a similar situation as me!",dating

We met when I was 18 and he was 30 but before that we talked daily on Skype for two years prior to meeting. 

I tought he was going to be the man I marry and have a life with he was also my first ever boyfriend.

Things didn’t workout with distance it seems like he was happy having fun every six months seeing me and not wanting compromise so I decided to finish the relationship because it was too painful for me, being away from him killed me everytjme and seeing not interest in making a plan to be together also was painful.

When I was going to Germany December of 2021 he said one week before me going that he didn’t wanted me there and that was better that I do not go so that was the end of relationship. 

Is been hard to process everything still I just want to make my mind accept that he’s not coming back but I can’t how can I have still hope after everything is just so stupid for myself. It has affected my self confidence and I cannot trust again another man, I cannot meet anyone and feel interested even if the man is good looking or anything I just can’t.

2749,"Well, like many others, I (26M) took a shot and asked someone in person. Rejection felt okay, surprisingly!","Went out with my sister and brother in law to grab ice cream on our vacation, tiny little island village. The girl there was real cute and giggly when we talked, I saw her looking at me and so did they, pointing it out when we walked out. She gave me double the ice cream I ordered (ooooo big deal) but definitely my type.

We had our ice cream, I came back a little later on my bike and asked for a water just to try and get her number. She giggled and brushed it off, but had a big smile. I got the message and left, told her to have a nice night. Maybe she’s with someone, maybe it’s that it’s weird while she’s working, maybe she just wasn’t interested.

2752,I think my friends might be setting me up,"I broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years about two months ago.  I had been talking with a therapist about ""is it wrong for me to want to start dating already?"" and she assured me that if I feel ready, I should just go for it.

I mentioned this to a friend couple (married couple who are both good friends of mine) and they supported me, and invited me to their place for Memorial Day Weekend.

Every time I have crashed at their place, it has almost always been the three of us.  Well, they said they invited another friend over tomorrow to barbecue: an available woman.

It seems like they're trying to set me up.  I can't confirm that, but it simultaneously makes me feel sort of flattered, but also nervous.  I'm not attractive, and pretty heavily overweight right now, so I feel like it would just be a complete disaster.

At any rate, I'm happy to be spending time with my friends, and am excited to meet any of their other friends, regardless.

Anyway he was always telling me that we can meet up soon etc etc. 

I gave up on asking him to see me after I realised it wasn’t going to happen and him getting my hopes up. 

He messaged me out of the blue last week asking how I am. I replied and asked him how he is and he didn’t read it or reply (I don’t know, I deleted the thread).

he was fun and sex could have been ok

but i was in such a messy moment of my life and also seeing other people (everything talked about upfront) so in a way i just couldnt manage

at some point he wanted to meet again and i was starting to see i was not interested and stressed with other stuff so i just told him i was stresed and sad (that was true) so couldt meet. ok i did not tell him i was maybe not so interested, as i was still kinda figuring it out at the time

so i told him i would stay home instead of meeting but i went to do stuff like lunch with grandma lol

so when i came home in the mailbox there was a flower and then i saw his whatsapp and ibwas so creeped out he had come to my block and managed to get in (in my city to enter a block you need key or someone to open, and mailboxes are inside) while he thought that i was at home

So we never met again

I was creeped out but i wonder if somebody would have felt flattered or if it was just the moment i was in my life, or that i really didnt like him in the end, etc???

2755,When did you feel up to dating people with children from prior relationships?,"I'm a late 20's M, somewhat recently single and I'm still getting over that. I'm a good communicator and feel I do great when I get into relationships, but the whole approach and dating process I've found difficult and draining (I must be the only one! /s) 

I'm looking for my next relationship to be my last, and my goals include having kids of my own.

When I was younger, I found the idea of dating someone who already had kids as a solid incompatibility. Mostly, I think it came from a space of ""I'm too young for this"", as well as the usual pitfalls associated with single parents - tighter schedules, other parent drama, etc.

I'm thinking at this point of reconsidering my hard line on it - it's still a red flag of course that I'll keep tabs on through the dating process, but everyone's different, and it doesn't necessarily stand as a character flaw. So it's starting to feel like less of a barrier now, as long as the person is still eventually open to having kids with me.

I'm curious what others' thoughts are on dating people with kids is? At what age did you feel okay with it, or why do you avoid it? I'd appreciate good discussion on your thoughts and experiences, rather than just yes or no answers, cause I'm not sure myself!",dating
2756,I’m considerably pretty but why do guys not go for me?,"Throw away account. I (18F) often make first moves, try being social to meet new people. I get compliments from friends and whatnot and when I start talking to guys they get very surprised how I’ve never been in a relationship. Is this normal? I feel like I’m going delusional sometimes and that I think I’m prettier than I actually am.

This has made me go for guys that my friends say are ‘below my standard’ because at this point I don’t think I can do better. Guys never come up to me or make the first move after my so called ‘glow up’.

2757,Still in love with my ex and I can’t take her off my mind,"Im (25 male) still in love with my ex 
girlfriend (25 female). 
I have known my ex for 7 years now, met her during a convention for the WYD, and we have been friends ever since. 
I have been in love with her for the past 6 and half years, and we only got together last year after years of trying to get her, I know that she did love me, but she was always afraid to take the step and try to face her feeling towards me. Last year we had a crazy fight and we stopped talking for a 3 months, until out of the blue, she texts me “how are you?”, so to be fully honest i was mad at her and i was kinda rude when i texted back, but she wanted to meet, so we met after i finished with work that day, long story short, that day she decided that she did wanna face her feeling and we got together, for me it felt amazing, because i know she’s the one, the person who i have been worshiping for the last 6.5 years are finally with me, i was ecstatic. 
But the problem is when we did get together, we were both going through a rough time, I had a clinical depression, and not long ago before we got together, i found out that she survived a rape, and both had serious issues, so the relationship wasn’t under best circumstances. 
A month later after we got together we broke up because i have lied to her to “protect her” but ended up fucking everything up, we broke up one day later, after i confessed, because I couldn’t keep lying to her (but it was her decision to end it) i have tried to fight for the relationship and save it, but she was done with me, even as a friend, that night I actually thought about ending my life, and i was a step away from the ledge, but i stopped, because she always hated jokes about me killing myself, I couldn’t do it, i couldn’t inflect that pain on her, i remembered her saying “braking up with me was hard on her too, because she still love me”. 
Fast forward 3 months, and she calls out of the blue, wanting to check up on me, and she how i was doing, so, i told her that  the last 3 months were hell, but i was doing better, i started too see a therapist, and i don’t know if her talking to me to is good, but it did feel good to talk to her, even though every time she spoke i remembered that the pain she caused me, but also i do remember how i hurt her. 
So we decided to meet, to see how each of us was doing, and when the minute i saw her, i felt so many things, happiness, anger, frustration, i wanted to hug her, but i also wanted to yell at her. 
So we ended chatting for a couple of hours, and we became “friends” again. 
Months go by and we used to see each other on a daily basis, and i knew that at some point we will talk about the break up, and we did, to give you the short version of the conversation: we would never get back together, my lie was to big to forgive and forget, it hurt her so bad and she doesn’t want go though that again ever in her life. 
Hearing these words was the hardest thing i ever had to go through, but i would rather have my friend back that for us to be back to together. 
A year have gone by since that conversation took place, and I can’t still take her out my mind, i know she’s the one for me, but i also know that she’ll never be mine again. It hurts knowing that. 
Lately i have taken some distance since she moved out of the city where we lived, and i have changed from texting her back immediately and telling her every little detail about my day like before, and i also stopped “caring” about her stories, but i was dying inside every time i did that, i was trying to protect myself this time. 
It been a weeks since i have talked to her for a long period of time, and im trying to cut her off so maybe finally i can move on, but i can’t. Every day passes i hate myself more for trying to cut her off, im still madly in love with her and I don’t know what to do. 
I just wanted to vent out knowing maybe someone is reading this, thank you for reading.

2758,How do I ask if we’re boyfriend and girlfriend?,"Basically I have this friend who’s a girl, I know for a fact she likes me and she knows I like her as well. We message each other every day and flirt frequently as well really blatantly(like saying each other are pretty, cute, will miss each other, things like that). We have nicknames for each other that no one else uses and have said we’d only really want the other person to call us that. Basically we are practically in a relationship, we’ve done everything except actually say it(and even then she one time said “some people are basically already in a relationship without knowing it” to me, this was before she knew I had a crush on her as well though). I just don’t know how to ask it without being super awkward.

Btw we’ve straight up told each other that we both had crushes on each other, I’m not just assuming stuff or anything. We’ve known for like 3-4 weeks and just haven’t said anything past that besides being a lot more open about finding each other attractive and wanting to be around each other and stuff. She’s also said that her friends wanted to meet me and I did meet with one of them one time and she told me after that her friend said she liked me(not in the same way obviously).

2759,Help me move on from a past situationship,"Last November, I started to talk to a guy I met thanks to a dating app. We tried to see each other multiple times but each time one of us was too busy. In December, we finally succeeded to see each other. I had no expectations what so ever. I liked talking to him but on his picture he just seemed like a regular guy. The moment I saw him in real life, I don’t know what happened but I was really really attracted to him. It never happened to me before this strongly. Before meeting him, I was single for a bit more than 1 year and had the feeling love would never be possible for me. To feel this kind of attraction for a guy was a new hope for me that I was wrong and love was still an option in my life. For one week we saw each other almost every day. He was the one asking to see me. I’ve never felt this kind of sexual tension with anybody before. It was so intense and the sexe was the best I’ve ever had. After one week I could feel something changed as he would take longer to answer my text and would be the one asking to see me. I tried to give him an opportunity to let me know if he was no longer interested several times. I felt that as we shared such complicity, he at least owed me to be honest and let me know if he hasn’t interested in me.  Last time we saw each other was end of January. When I saw him, everything was the same as before. He told me that he still wanted to see me so I decided to see if he was sincere by letting him come back to me next time and ask to see me, which he never did. Two weeks later, he posted a picture on his insta story and I think he was on a date. I deleted him from insta because I wanted to be able to move one and forget about him. One month later, he ask me again on insta, I accepted him and he never talked to me. I deleted him again 3 weeks ago but now it’s been 5 months since we last saw each other and I’m still thinking a lot about him. The fact I had the best sex in my life with him makes it even worst. How can I move on ? Should I continue to not talk to him as I’ve been doing for the last 5 months or as it’s not working should I try the opposite and text him ? If I do text him, I’m afraid my self esteem will be hurt but in the same time I feel like I’m going crazy not being able to let go for a guy I saw only a few times and such a long time ago now.",dating

I’m trying to improve myself and put myself in a position to eventually lose my virginity, but I imagine that won’t be for another six months to a year. By that point, I’ll be 25 with still no experience.

How much of an issue is this? If I’m still a virgin at 25, how much of a red flag or deal breaker is that for women? I’m just worried about not being able to gain experience because my lack of experience will be a deterrent in my dating life.

2763,my sexual pleasure comes very secondary to him if not last or not considered at all,"I feel my boyfriend is very selfish during sex sometimes, like my pleasure comes very secondary to him if not last or not considered at all. 

Unless I ask before sex for anything, he typically just nuts before I do and barely tries to last. It’s something that can be fixed, but I don’t feel he has the urge to fix it. 

Although I do I feel that if he truly considered my sexual desires and needs before his things it would make a world of difference in our sex life. I just hate that he doesn’t.

If I’m getting fantastic head from him one moment he decides he wants to 69 and for me the over all the angle is just bad and I don’t get the same pleasure as him going down on me like normal. Yet, he wants me to give his dick all the attention in the world if his turn for a blowjob. Or if we’re having sex and I feel the positions been going on to long so I try to switch positions sometimes he doesn’t budge because he’s too focused on just coming. And tonight was no better because I’m on my period (yes we have period sex) so of course I’m very horny and I wanted to have sex but he was wanting me to give him head, which I didn’t want to do one because I knew I was not gonna get any myself obviously, but I also felt that if I gave him head I’d just be railing him up to cum faster if we proceeded with having any type sex which I don’t want. I want to have feel pleasure too and not just for a minute or it be one sided.

I tried to address him about it and he started saying “I’m sorry I give you bad sex and don’t pleasure you at all” rather than hearing me out when I recommended he just considers my needs too before he nuts since it seems easier for him and I even offered solutions like taking a minute, changing positions and etc. but he tuned me out and keep repeating what he said before.

I've been feeling lonely since couple months ago, so I decided to try dating apps.

I'm 21, M and currently studying at university, but I have little to no hope meeting someone there, as my faculty is overflown with men. Consequences of studying engineering I guess.

Therefore, I'd like to ask you how/where to find some new people? The Internet seemed the best option since I'm constantly working/studying and don't really have much time to go to the gym, bars or parties. Also, parties and bars are not my cup of tea.

2768,Confused with women and myself,"18m j just finished my first year in college. This my first year ever kissing and having intercourse with a girl. I have done it with quite a few girls but ive noticed some patterns. 
1. I have not had a talking phase or a “relationship” that has lasted over 2 months

2. I have only gotten laid off online dating apps(tinder..etc)  and have never kissed or had intercourse with a girl that ive met first in person

3. I have trouble making friends and have not been approached at all. I have to do a lot of initiating and all of that to get and maintain a friend. 

I am not ugly. Ive been told im attractive by lots of different girls. White male, bht about 5’6.

2769,Dating with social anxiety?,"I’ve been single for nearly 10 years. I’ve never had a long term relationship and I rarely find myself interested in someone. When I am interested, it’s all or nothing.

But because I’ve been so long out of the dating scene, and because I really struggle with social anxiety, I don’t really know how to approach online dating. Over the years I’ve been on a handful of dates with people from dating apps—maybe 5 or 6–but I’ve never gone on a second date because I haven’t felt attracted to them.

I think a huge issue for me is that I feel so uncomfortable and forced during the date itself. I hate making small talk and my social anxiety is super piqued, so much so that I always have a really unpleasant/uncomfortable time which blocks me feeling sexy/romantic/attracted to anyone. And because I’m so all or nothing, I struggle to continue going on dates with someone if I don’t feel comfortable with them/attracted to them.

I want to give online dating more of a shot but it’s such an unpleasant experience for me. After a recent date, I felt pressured to kiss the guy even though I wasn’t feeling it but did it anyway and then ugly-cried the whole hour drive home. I think the hours spent with him and me being anxious + then him being clear about his attraction to me was just overwhelming, in a really bad way.

In my day to day life I have awesome friendships and great people around me, but because of my social anxiety i really struggle in environments where I have to meet new people.

Being a trusting person I didn't think much of it till months later I caught her in some other lie about being busy and figured out this must be bullshit too.

When I confronted her she admitted it was a lie and said that her phycologist had told her to spend 4 days apart from me with no contact to assess her feelings for me at the time and he suggested telling me she was going away for work.

I broke up with her immediately, but she is begging me for another chance I want to give her one, but I feel like she is not being honest with me still.

I know a lot of people are weird about age gaps. Majority of my exs are actually older than me... furthest being 23 years difference.

I've been through a lot of shit and have a pretty high walls but recently I've been missing any sort of connection with a woman.

Am I over thinking this all? Or should I just see how things span out?",dating
2782,I don't know if this girl likes me or is just playing with me,"Currently, I (26M) am preparing at a gym (academy) to become a firefighter, and for the past three weeks, a new girl (27F) comes to me constantly while training to train together. Last week, while we were talking (I don't remember exactly about what), she mentioned that she had received a new bed frame and needed help assembling it. I didn't pay much attention to it, although I found it strange to mention something like that to someone she had known for only a few days.

The next day, I asked her if she had managed to assemble the bed frame, and she replied, ""I'm a woman, I’m not good at those things. I need someone to help me."" I laughed it off and, although I thought about it, I didn't say anything.

The following day, I dared to ask her if she wanted me to help her assemble it, to which she said yes and offered to invite me to anything I wanted as a way to thank me. Since it was a Thursday, we decided to meet the following week.

Ever since offering to help her, we started texting each other daily. Initially, we talked about what it's like to prepare to become a firefighter, but we ended up talking a little bit of everything (she even sent me a selfie of her training/swimming in the pool).

We ended up meeting the following Thursday afternoon to assemble the bed frame (nothing remotely sexual happened), and as a way to thank me she offered to invite me to dinner. The dinner went well; we got to know each other better, talked about everything, and laughed together. I offered to split the bill, but she insisted on paying, saying that I invite her the next time (which made me think she wanted to meet again).

On the way back to her place (my car was parked outside her house), I noticed that the joy from the dinner seemed to have faded, so I didn't think it was a good idea to kiss her. So I decided to be direct:

\-	J, do you consider this as a date?

\-	Oh, I hadn't really thought about it. What do you consider ""a date""?

\-	""I like you, and I want to know you better.""

At this point, she started making gestures with her arms, indicating uncertainty.

\-	I just got out of a complicated relationship.

\-	Okay, I don't want to force anything. And you Women inspire me respect (xd).

We talked about it for about 20 seconds, but I can't remember the details due to nervousness. We hugged, smiled, and went our separate ways.

The next day we saw each other again at the gym, and the situation continued as it was before we went on the ""date"". At no point did I feel any uncomfortableness (we trained really close to each other again), and she said goodbye, asking me to let her know how I did in a physical test I had later that afternoon. We have continued to talk every day, and we have plans to go to a climbing wall this Thursday (tomorrow).

It's worth noting that everyone at the gym tells me that it's obvious she likes me. I've also asked some female friends for their opinion, and they say that if she doesn't like me she's just playing with me.

I respect (and accept) that she recently came out of a relationship and may not be interested in anything serious at the moment. I also don't know how to aproach the situation, my experience with women is limited, I'm a virgin. Honestly, I don't know what to think. I prefer a ""No"" over a ""Maybe.""

What do you think?",dating
2783,Am I wrong for being exclusive after the first date if there is interest for more dates?,"I have been seeing this girl for a couple of months, recently haven’t hung out as much because I’m travelling. I try to only date one person at a time because it takes too much energy from me to talk to multiple people at once and I tend to not talk to them/get to know them as well. 

Recently felt her texts were getting drier and she was taking longer to respond and found out she was joking to her friends about ghosting me and texting another guy who was also giving her the same energy she is giving me (leaving her on seen, not texting back for hours, short replies). She is obviously much more into being ignored than being given attention. She is also still not over her ex bf who she broke up with more than a year ago.

Should I go back to dating multiple people at once no matter what unless exclusivity is agreed upon? Seems to me girls like chasing more than being respected and given attention. Or is this girl just immature?",dating
2784,Question: Why seems like Americans care so much about age gaps and make such a huge fuss?,"Just for context, I am not American, but I do see that mostly Americans make a huge ordeal if the age gap it's bigger than 4 years, now I am not talking about an age gap where minors are involved, but for example Leonardo DiCaprio, the fuss it's gigantic! I understand not wanting a big gap for someone below 18 or even freshly 18, but why everyone seems to think that a 20 year old woman is suddenly incapable to consent a relationship with an older partner ? 

At least for me and in the places I have traveled, nobody cares for age gaps if the younger part it's at least 20, it's common sense that at that age you know enough to be able to consent a relationship with whoever you want regardless of age, I have even seen such  huge fuss when the gaps are not big, but suddenly called ""predatory"", if for example one is 18 and the other 23 , or 19 and 24 , which for me seems really stupid, sure I would see as a red flag a guy in his 30's wanting an 18 year old fresh out of highschool (or any women below 20), but a guy in his early 20's? 

Ps : I know DiCaprio has a pattern of dating just 20-25 , but nearly all his gfs except Giselle and a girl who was the daughter of the CEO of JP Morgan, got HUGE career boosts , so do not come at me with ""they were naive"" at f 20 years old, Leo is a shortcut for models and they know it.

Extra info : (I am 25 F) my dating experience was , (16-19)  we broke up 5 years and a half later ( 22-26), 
2 nd bf (22-35) we lasted about 7 months and broke up bc he had to move back to his country in another continent and LDR was not a possibility for us. 

3 rd bf (23-39) a year and a half (24-41), now I am seeing someone who is 30 and the gap is smaller, I feel no power imbalance whatsoever compared to all my previous relationships with much older guys in my early 20's and neither did I feel like I was powerless in my last relationships compared to the one I have now",dating
2785,Was approached by a girl and don’t know what to do,"Context: I was with some friends talking at the table (I wasn’t seated), a girl out of nowhere approached me and said hi, I said hi back, we started talking, so she asked me if I wanted to go sit in another table so I was like sure, so we went to another table and stayed there for sometime talking, at some point she gave me her instagram, i told her like do I need to tell u a pickup line to get your number?, as a joke but didn’t go through so I just moved forward, she started following, I followed her back then we continued talking then in the end we said our goodbyes and today we texted a little, so I have two doubts, how should I proceed?

2786,My “partner” (32m) has a lower sex drive than me and I feel rubbish.,"I hope I’ve done this right… 

So to preface me (31F) has been single for a long time, in that time I’ve lost a LOT of weight and got as healthy as I can be. I recently started hanging around with an old friend (m32) and we’ve been casually seeing each other. We’ve had sex a few times. 


So my issue lies in - 
He’s a bit awkward and struggles to compliment me / show affection. 

He has a low sex drive due to previous drug abuse and isn’t very often In the mood. 

He says he’ll jump on me if I give him a BJ but I don’t want every time to have to be me pushing it on him. 

Like I know he’s liked me a long time and I think our relationship could work longer term but I need to feel attractive / sexy/ desired / loved. (That might seem “fast” but he’s loved me and me him as friends for a long time) 

Things im taking as good; 
He has practically lived at my house for the last week and im hoping that’s a good sign he wants to spend time with me. 

He wants to text me a lot and talk all the time. 

He seems comfortable in most other ways around me. 

We get on tremendously and I trust him with my life (I even let him take my car a few times which is a major trust thing for me) 


So basically im just looking for some advice… 
What should I do to help the situation? 
Any tips from men on how I can help with the sex drive thing? (Obviously I’m going to respect his boundaries) 
Any ideas would be appreciated.",dating
2787,Don't know how to get in a relationship,"I can't figure out how relationships work or how to get in one. Can someone give me some advice? 

I'm average in height, though I am 15 pounds overweight, (but I have lost nearly 90 pounds over the last two years through intermitten fasting, limiting my caloric intake, and weight lifting). I have friends, (roughly half of which are female). I I try to talk to women as often as I can, but almost everyone in my class is male, with the three women in my class being a mom with a husband, taken, and ten years older than me respectively, (though I can confidently say that one of them is my friend). 

I've tried joining a club at college, but I couldn't really make any connections with people there, I've tried ""cold approaching"", (mostly at a bookstore and on transit because night clubs and bars are too overstimulating for me), but I stopped because I feel like most women don't like being approached in general and I almost always come off looking like a creep. I don't have any knowledge or experiance with flirting. I have tried asking my friends if they can introduce me to girls they know, but none of them know anyone that's available.

I've been able to get quite a few phone numbers after talking to girls, but most of them have ghosted me after I text them. I have not used dating apps, since there are no tone indicators while messaging on them, and asynchronous communication gives me stress. I'd much rather talk to girls in person. As well, there's the fact that the ratio of men to women on those apps are 2:1, meaning that my chances of someone swiping on my profile would be slim no matter what, and this is coupled with the fact that dating app developers have a profit incentive to keep their users single, because then they use their app more.

I have missed out on a lot of social development due to taking 4 years of online learning by myself instead of being in a regular class environment due to having GAD, and school was a big trigger that I was only able to overcome recently. I had to build up all of my newly acquired social skills from scratch over the past year while attending college, which was really difficult since I also have autism. Even though I have developed enough socially to have friends, I still feel like I have no knowledge on dating or how to get in a relationship.

I honestly don't want sex or anything like that, but I long for someone to hold hands with, to kiss, and cuddle with. Someone to take to the movies, and share intimate moments with. Sometimes I just go through my day, but then I start obsessing over thoughts like that, and it makes it hard for me to focus and concentrate. And then I just get so hung up that I still haven't had these experiences. I've even given myself minor panic attacks over this. I've felt like I've tried everything to try and increase my chances of meeting someone who I can love, but I'm starting to give up hope.

I dont really have any preference, (I find almost every women I see attractive in some way), but I guess I would like to be in a relationship with someone slightly older than me, and with some experiance, so then they can teach me everything I don't know about relationships, and guide me through the process. I'm 20 years old FYI.

2792,Why would someone travel over a thousand miles to hook up with someone they don’t have feelings for?,"Hello I (F 27) have known this guy (M 26) since college. We reconnected last fall for a few months, the nature of our relationship was kind of a long distance friends with benefits (over social media) situation. He had asked to come visit me during Thanksgiving on his way back home so we could hook up. (This was expressly stated as the reason for the visit by both of us.) 

Long story short the situation ended before that could happen (I caught feelings and he did not) but I’m curious as to why he would travel thousands of miles to hook up with me if there weren’t some feelings on his part? When there are plenty of women he could hook up with in the city he lives in. He is a very attractive man so it’s not like he would be lacking in potential hook up partners. 

For more context, he lives out on the East Coast and I’m in the Midwest. We were both raised and went to college in the South, and his family still lives in the south. He would have to go hundreds of miles out of his way to come visit. So why do this when he did not have feelings for me?

Now, I know we're gonna meet for another date soon because we already texted, so my question is how should I approach it, should I still play it cool and wait, or should I go for it and kiss her straight away without hesitation?

PS, sorry for the wrong flair",dating
2795,How do I move on?,"I (25M) started dating this girl (F22) back in november last year, and initially I wasn't really attracted to her, she wasn't my usual type, pretty tall and she had buzzed her hair. She kept on texting me and I eventually gave her a chance. We started hanging out several days of the week, we slept a lot at each others places. Talked on socials all the time. Everything looked good.   


I started liking her a lot, the more time I spent with her the more attractive she became in my eyes. Everything felt so natural, I could be myself and not hold up a front. Anyway we continued to date up until the middle of march, that's when I noticed her energy was different, she didn't complement me anymore, she didn't give back the same energy I gave her. After a few weeks of that I confronted her by telling her I've noticed it and asked.   


""What are we, and where is this going?""   
She replied with saying she thought I was perfect but she hasn't developed any feelings towards me, she's felt like this for a period of time but wanted to be sure of her decision so she waited. I knew she was fresh out of a relationship when we first met and thought about being a rebound but at the time I didn't care about it since I wasn't really attracted to her. My heart sank as she told me that but I told her I wasn't really looking for anything serious either anyway. A few days later she had removed me from all socials except snap and insta, she still kept romantic pictures we had togheter but gradually removed them over the months. Idk but the fact that she seemed to no longer want anything to do with me rather than to be just friends, hurt more.  


  
It's been 2.5 months now since we stopped all contact, the first few days I felt so depressed and couldn't think of anything else than her, I had no breaks when working, every thought led back to her.  
Looking at other women made me feel sick to the stomach. I was also mad and jelous at her how I could feel like this and how she could move on with no problem.  


Eventually that feeling faded and I've distracted myself by taking care of my self by working out, skincare routine, upgrading my wardrobe. I could finally look at other women in a romantic way.  
I can go weeks feeling fine, being alone and focusing on my self and spending quality time with my friends and family. But some days I wake up with this gut wrenching feeling of missing her, I don't know why, why am I not over her, am I dreaming of her in my sleep? And I'm back in to the mentality of what I can do to get her back. My mindset it fucked, I try to do all for myself but I realize my first thought after I do some kind of self improvment is ""ohh now she's going to find me more attractive and want me back.""   


Now to my question how do I move on?  
I don't know what to do, I want to move on but a part of me wants to reach out and try again but obviously she wants nothing to do with me I'm guessing. I have a few other girls wanting to date me but I can't, I only want this girl and I hate it.   


Sorry for the long post, no one will probably read it but I need to vent my feelings, I never do that, just by typing this out I feel better.",dating
2796,Worst. Breakup. Ever.,"Hey hey! throwaway for obv reasons, and mostly posting to vet because my friends are probably sick of hearing me by now (lol), but yeah. My(28)... ex(24), now, I guess... broke up with me about 3 weeks ago and it's been wicked tough. I've never actually cried over anything until now, even in past breakups. 

We were friends at first, maybe a bit of flirting, but I was in a place where I was trying OLD and mostly looking for friends. Turns out we really bounced off one another and while i had a bit of a crushy, I didn't want to mess things up since i valued our interactions. Turns out one day after going to a club with a few mutual friends, she kissed me and i kissed back and things went from there. Turns out we both really liked each other and found each other attractive. Oopsie. Long story short, we ended up having an intimate relationship for about 3 months, and saw each other about once a week, since we were busy. Things were going great and all of our friends were saying how cute we were together, and i was telling my friends about us. 

Over those 3 months we were opening up to each other and just getting closer. And i loved ever second with her.

Well, 3 weeks ago, the voice message came out of the blue one day, that she isn't in the place for a relationship right now and that i should move on, that she couldn't give us as much attention and time that a relationship deserved and yeah. Absolutely busted me up because I didn't see any signs. Well we agreed to just meet up one last time at hers before she moved (was moving to a new place that week), did the deed and things were really emotional.

I said that in the future, if we're both in the place to dedicate time and we're both still single... yeah. That i'd wait because I had no desire to be with anyone else, and wouldn't for a while. She said she was relived i said that first because she felt the same way and to just wait for 2 weeks. 

I was ok with that but still filled with emotions and anxiety. So i decided to spend the next weekend out with some friends, have a few drinks (margs on cinco de mayo) and go to a club. Everyone i invited wasn't free then, so I ended up hanging out i with one of my friend's friends who were all women. No biggie I thought, it's not a 1-on-1 thing and I had no interest in anything stupid. 

I ended up adding a picture or two of my night out to my insta story and didn't think much of it, since my ... ex... went out to a club the weekend before with a mutual (female) friend and it was whatever - she wanted a girl's night  out and i trusted her not to do anything dumb, lol. 

I was invited to said friends' dinner party the next night and figured why not, it'd be fun since it was star-wars themed, lmao. Posted just one pic of myself (mirror selfie) and just didn't think too much of it other than maybe she'd like me looking good and having fun too. 

two days later i got an Ok. text from her and then the next, another voice message that i should move on and not to wait. I was thrown into complete mental disarray, sent a mildly long text abt how i was going to ask her for coffee the coming friday, but now, i see where she's at and is cold and yeah. Sucks because i still cared so much for her.

Idk, its about the 4rd week now and I think i'm finally getting ready to at least unfollow her. I still have moments throughout the day where I just want to ask her how she's been, if she's eaten, just saying sweet things, and thinking of cute lil dates i'd like to go on. And it hurts so much just to see the occasional 2, 3 word text, and even just seeing 'liked by [person]' on my random insta feed, and just being reminders.

Guess i'm sort of asking if it's worth trying to be even on good terms again, or just scorch the earth. I'm already hitting the gym hardcore and trying to get all my ducks in a row, but i just feel like i've got this big, black hole where my heart used to be that still filled with love but i can't see it with anyone else. 

I have no idea what to do, since i've never been in a breakup this bad or tbh, even cared for someone quite so much...",dating

I have had this messaged saved for a few weeks now but couldn’t send it as some things are better said in person. I know that chance is unlikely now but I am struggling to move forward. I keep thinking about what could have been 

I wish I’d just been transparent and honest with you. That night, I just got myself all nervous and I could see in your face that I had disappointed. There were 3 reasons that I that kiss was bad and there was no spark:
1. I am inexperienced, you’re the 2nd girl I’ve ever kissed. I wanted to tell you before we’d got for that moment
2. Truthfully I was very nervous as I kinda liked you. I have only found 1 other person who I’ve connected with, so I’d put too much pressure in myself
3. I’d overthought it since a certain moment on our 1st date. I wanted it to be romantic and had a little plan in my head for how it would happen. Then it was spur of the moment and I was just nervous truthfully. Being hopelessly romantic means I struggle to live in the moment

With a bit of space over the last few weeks, honestly I just feel disappointed in myself. Needed more courage to tell and show you how I felt. I just got myself all nervous as I liked you and should have been in the moment more. I know that moment has gone now, I understand your decision

Believe me when I say I’ve cringed and regretted that moment everyday so far. I am hoping this message will free me now, so I can move forward. Thinking about it, we are all human and make mistakes, regret things. I hope I’ll learn for it and potentially find someone in the future",dating

2802,I am willing to go to the gym for my boyfriend,"Tw: mentions of diet and underweight

Tl;dr: boyfriend would like it if I had impressive muscles and he masturbates to other women online to fulfill his kink, women irl catch his interest and there’s nothing I can do, I’m willing to change for him but idk if I’m the one being treated unfairly

I apologize in advance, this text is not that structured and grammatically correct

Background: I got together with my boyfriend several months ago. Just about one and half months into the relationship he started talking to me about my eating habits and he encouraged me to throw away sweets that I got for Christmas from my relatives to which I said I didn‘t wanna throw them away because they were presents. At that time he already expressed that he was afraid I‘d get diabetes and lately we figured out that this fear he has is irrational but I try to respect that since my fears aren‘t rational either (social anxiety). Further into the relationship there were multiple occasions where he encouraged me to throw away food or even did it himself without me wanting to. I had the feeling I ate too much (my BMI was average, 21.5). The first times this happened I didn‘t agree on throwing the food away but a few weeks ago it happened again and I felt so bad about it, I agreed and even started a diet. I‘ve been eating in a calorie deficit for almost 5 weeks now and I lost 3,5kg using an app to track my food intake. I was planning to get to a BMI of 18.8, so still average but right before hitting underweight. I guess my liking of kpop influenced that as well.

Now to the current situation: My boyfriend has a kink for women with very impressive muscles and even told me he occasionally jerks off to videos of those women. I feel insecure when he mentions that and we even agreed upon him trying not to do that (I told him it’s okay if he can’t). Since I have a fear of abandonment and I just want him to like my body more, I want to start going to the gym but I‘m afraid for different reasons. First one is my social anxiety, I‘m very sensitive and afraid to go to a place with many people and to look like a fool because I have no experience with the gym at all and I‘d rate myself very bad at sports, weak and out of breath early. I already worked out at home a few times and I even planned a whole workout schedule for myself already (home & gym workouts even). I‘ve scrolled through social media and my newest idol is LeanBeefPatty. I‘m afraid that my boyfriend would have to wait so long for me to be strong and more attractive. He expressed that it’d be easier for him to get turned on if I had more muscles. I‘m afraid of having too high expectations and not looking the way I want to look in the future (for example because my current goal weight might be too skinny looking). I guess I might’ve developed some kind of body dysmorphia over the past months.

Things I have to say in defense of my boyfriend: He told me he doesn‘t expect me to do all of that work and it would be okay if I decided to quit the gym, although he really likes the idea of me having more muscles and he fantasized about it. He stated he’d just want me to be healthy and happy.

But on the other hand, lately he told me that he thought about a woman he saw in real life (that we see from time to time) for about a week and he told me it could happen in the future that other women can catch his interest during our relationship and there‘s nothing I can do about it. I asked him if there‘s anything I do wrong but to that he answers with no except for the times where I am too insecure for no real reason. He said that even if I had impressive muscles and a clean face, other women could still catch his interest in the future. I don’t know if that’s a thing I have to accept since I don’t experience that. Anyways, to that I reacted emotional and seem to have judged him too much for that so that he confronted me the next day about my judgement (also about jerking off to other women) and asked me what I had expected.

I feel a little better right now since I tried to force myself to be in a better mood for his sake. I have a poor perception and I don’t know if I’m treated unfairly or if I treat him unfairly but I’m willing to do anything for him.

Another side note before anyone attacks him: He’s neurodivergent. That’s also why I’m thinking that maybe I should change my views and not try to change his.

+something I’ve answered to some people’s comments in other subreddits which I think is important:

I trust him that he’s being honest with me. He does tell me he thinks I’m attractive. He did feel ashamed about the incident of thinking of another woman for a while but he did mention that he tried to think of me instead. That woman I’m talking about is actually not muscular but her behavior and looks remind me of myself. He also told me to trust him because he’d try to not get close to and avoid the women he might find interest in. It could be that it’s just something new and exciting but he told me doesn’t need that and that he’s happy in the relationship. Might sound very different from my first post. He has other traits to make up for this whole thing. He also doesn’t force me to go to the gym or anything I just don’t feel desirable enough yet when I compare myself to gym girls.",dating
2803,22M made out with a girl for the first time,"Hi I’m 22M made out with a girl for the first time ever. It was the most awkward and embarrassing moment of my life. I have hardly been on any dates and it’s only now that I’ve started going on dates. I’m not a socially awkward person, I’m not even awkward with girls when hanging out generally or having general conversations. But I’m shit scared to initiate anything physical that you would consider intimate (which starts from kissing and everything beyond that). I’ve never initiated with any girl that I’ve been on a date with (not many to begin with). 

I had a great time with this girl that I went out with, and she was enjoying too. We had broken the physical barrier way before - hugs, holding hands, playful nudges, but I was shit scared to go for a kiss because I’ve never done it before. She realised I’m too shy to initiate and asked if I wanted to make out, directly. I said yes and the next few minutes were a bit stressful, full of nervous energy. She asked me what the last time was when I made out with somebody and I said never. She was too surprised, as anyone would be, but was okay with it. 

We kind of made out then, it barely lasted for a few seconds because I think I was doing something terribly wrong and was awkward. The next few minutes were very awkward and embarrassing for me, although she tried to be supportive. I made the mistake of asking her how terrible it was, she just said it’s fine it was your first time. 

But now I’ve lost all confidence in life. This is by far the most embarrassing and awkward moment of my life. I’m not worried about this particular girl because we’re both leaving town soon and probably never gonna see each other again. But I’m worried about ‘dating’ in general now. I have zero experience in anything physical and girls kinda expect you to be experienced at this age. I don’t know what to do, please help. Is this normal to suck this big at something that should be so simple?

Also how okay is it to let the girl know that you haven’t kissed/made out/done stuff before. Because now I know how much I suck, so she would obviously find that out. How would y’all go about it?",dating

2806,Going from 100 to 0?,"I (24M) matched with this girl visiting my city, who turned out to live a few hours away (coincidentally in the area where I grew up). 

We texted everyday for a week and everything seemed like it was going well. We talked over the phone and made a playlist together. She seemed pretty engaged.

I asked if she wanted to stay over the weekend with me and go on a date and she was pretty down. We looked up flights together and she said she’d check again in a few days to see if prices went down.

Then she messaged me saying that she doesn’t think she can pay for it right now because she’s been going on a lot of trips and needs to budget. She said we’d have to push back our date. 

That’s fine with me. So we texted for a few more days like normal, but then she started to respond very infrequently. Like she’d reply to me once every few days, but never tried to keep the convo going. 

I know I’m getting slow faded (because it always seems to happen to me with girls I’m genuinely interested in…). Idk what caused the sudden disinterest. 

Just frustrated because she suddenly went from down to meet up to barely talking to me. 

We’re friends on instagram and she’s being going out and having fun it seems, so I doubt it’s because she’s too busy to talk to me. 

I’ve been talking to this other girl in the meantime, but I’m not that interested. We’ve been on a couple dates, but I’m leaning towards ending things (don’t have the dynamic I’m looking for).

I’m thinking I should just live my life and stop giving a fuck about slow fade girl, but leave the door open if she wants to reach out to me. 

I’m just sick of girls showing interest and leading me on, then randomly pulling away without warningZ How I can minimize this happening?",dating

A few days pass and she shows interest in spending more time with me and later proceeds to ask me for dinner at a restaurant she used to work at. 

The thing is, I’m actually interested in her but I figured i should get to know them via non-date/non-romantic activities before seeing them as someone datable.

2808,Is it really that hard to find a good gf in college?,"So I (19M) have never dated. Not in High School. Not in Middle School. I didn't feel like dating or being in a relationship for a long time, but now I do feel ready to finally start dating.

But recently, I have been seeing a lot of posts on other forums as well as other communities saying how hard it is to find legit relationships. To a good extent, this has also been my experience. I got hit on, a couple of times through Instagram, and most of them were looking to just hook up and seemed ingenuine. Now this makes me apprehensive about what the dating scene could be. The only hope I have is the fact that the university I attend has about 16,000 people. Though most people are commuters (like myself), I see a lot of people on campus and it's always buzzing.   
I had my first sem online (Spring 2023) and I'll be taking in-person classes for the first time this fall. So I don't really have a lot of experience meeting and talking to new people. My question is whether this is actually the case. Is it really that hard to find someone who wants to be in a genuine relationship?",dating

Pretty much title.

Do you drop ppl from your life the moment they show that they are not interested in future dating with you? If not - how do you do it cause it's driving me insane how shi\*\*y I am?

Let's say I try things with a girl I like, the moment I see that she does not plan to date me now or in future,  I cut contacts and most of the times in a rude way - I either stop replying or I reply as a jerk.

Not that I do not want to have them in my life, but I want them in another way - I am tired of new friendships going nowhere..",dating
2810,Reaching out after I unmatched?,"I (22F) matched with a guy (24M) and we texted for two weeks and it was all good. He asked me out earlier this week and said he wanted to call before we met. But it seems our phone call didn't go well. I thought the call was just about to confirm our date and nothing more so I ended it briefly after we cleared the schedule. Perhaps he wanted to talk more :(

He texted me on the dating app afterwards and mentioned a language barrier and canceled our date. He also noted that had we live not too far from each other, it would be easier (we live an hour away). The thing is, I speak fluent English and advance level of his native language. I unmatched him in disappointment. Now I regret it and want to meet him because he is one of the few guys that I like and also interested in a serious relationship, which is what I'm looking for.

2811,I don’t understand what I can do if I’m physically unattractive when I have to compete with men who are significantly more attractive,"I don’t really get it, I am literally always in competition where I don’t have a chance of women.

The thing that comes to mind the most for me is at work. I work in a predominantly female workplace with 3 men. The two other guys are significantly more attractive than me, taller, white, traditionally attractive face structure.

As a result, I don’t really get any attention from the women we work with and usually it’s them. Like when our restaurant closes between lunch they all go talk to them and I’m usually left out of it.

Women will come to where web are to talk to them and just pretend I’m not there.

We both loved it, and it was obvious that he loved it too.. the next day he was almost begging me to come over again. A few days later we saw each other and it happened again. Shortly after that we both had to travel, and I won’t be able to see him again as he is going to live in another country. We vibed so much during these few days and he even expressed how happy he was to find someone to chill with like that, and that he couldn’t believe it. I tried to keep contact with him, we kept texting, and sending each other pictures, until little by little I started to feel like I was initiating the conversations, and stopped texting him much, and at the end (5 days ago) he left my last text message on delivered… I just need y’all’s opinions and support, I don’t know how to feel about this.

2816,I’m (25F) not sure if my boyfriend (24M) just broke up with me?,"My partner and I have been dating for around 4 years, and living together for 2.5 years. Here is some extra background information:

TL;DR To give some background information, my boyfriend’s family got evicted and had to move in with us for around a year. That was literally the worst year of my life. The dad was a raging alcoholic with no job who sat around all day, the Brother refused to get a job and laid around all day, the sister dropped out of high school and stayed at the house all day, and the mom had 2 jobs and was the only one who picked up after her own family. I worked remote from home, so I was around this toxic mess for far too long. His mom and dad eventually got divorced and separated, and everyone else moved out together.

Anyway, as it’s been 4 years I have been hinting to my partner that I’m ready to move forward in our relationship to marriage. I’ve been looking into buying a house (solo but we would both move in), he’s showed me engagement ring designs, we’ve had plenty of conversations about our future, and I just really thought we were on the same page..

So my partner recently got a call from his mom. Her hours were cut at work, his brother was fired from his job, the person that they lived with quit their job and has no income and she’s basically struggling. There’s more to the back story, but I have no sympathy as there are 6 able-bodied adults in her house, but only one with a job. Everyone else just sits around and smokes weed.

My partner sat me down yesterday and said that at the end of the lease he wants to not renew it, move out and into his mom’s place so that he can help his family out and steer his siblings in the right path. He expected me to move back in with my parent. (we talked with my mom before about moving in with her to save for a down payment on a house)

I said that at this point I’m trying to move forward with our relationship - not split up so that he can parent grown adults, and how could he even think that?

At the end of the chat, he then went into a very long tangent about how I’m cluttery and disorganized, and that it fills him with so much anxiety that it makes him want to leave the relationship. And told me we can’t do chores 50/50 because he has a very physical job and I have an office job, so I need to do more of the housekeeping.

Doesn’t that just seem like an excuse at this point??? If he came up to me and said “we need to declutter” or “we need to talk about getting a maid” that would be one thing, but he straight up said that I’M THE ONE THAT FILLS HIM WITH  SOO MUCH ANXIETY.

He wants to stay together after splitting households, but am I right in thinking that he picked his blood family over me, so we’re basically over??

Edit: he came up to me last night and said he didn’t want to break up, and that it’s messed up to make him choose between me and his blood family…?",dating
2817,Is this guy into me? Or am I majorly overthinking this?,"So I (F23) recently started talking to my gym crush (m30). I’ve been crushing on him for months now and felt the same vibe back a little bit from him and decided to go up and introduce myself. Prior to introducing myself, we’d make eye contact nonstop. It went super well and he seemed excited that I came up and talked to him. The next time I saw him, he came up and said hi and we stood and chatted for close to an entire hour about everything under the sun.  

I’ve been seeing him pretty regularly for a couple weeks now at the gym and we talk each time. It varies whether it’s him that approaches me or vice versa, but each time we talk for quite awhile. It’s even gotten to a point where I’ve noticed him linger around after his workout if I’m not finished lifting yet. He’ll always come up before he leaves to talk and say goodbye. 

When we talk, it feels like pretty standard conversation. He’s not too flirty or direct with me. There’s some things he’s said that seems like maybe he’s hinting at something, but I can’t read him. I cannot tell if maybe he’s just shy, trying to be respectful, or is just not interested in me like that. But he hasn’t asked for my number or any social media, or to make any plans to see each other outside of the gym. Like I said, it’s been probably about 4 weeks now of us regularly chatting for lengthy periods of time at the gym. He’ll always ask what I’m doing after the gym or what my plans are for the week, but it will never go any further than that. 

I’m just confused as to why he would seek me out and remember the smallest details about me if he wasn’t interested in me. I thought he was into me, but now I’m just confused. If he wanted to just be gym friends, why would he talk to me for 20+ minutes each day he sees me? Im friends with a few guys at my gym and none of them are like this; pretty simple convo and it’s clear that there’s no romantic interest with them. Am I overthinking this?",dating

there is no fully preventing infatuation from happening, no matter how committed someone is to a relationship, because infatuation is always a sudden and involuntary reaction (why else would people “catch” feelings?)—and i’m sure the vast majority of us understand firsthand the sheer level of dopamine characteristic of it.

It is not a walk in the park to just kill feelings of infatuation for a person

and because feelings of infatuation are not by choice, I fully believe that the only way to gauge someone’s commitment is by how they would react if faced with an unexpected, immediate decision between focusing on their established relationship and exploring something else*

I don't use dating apps, but I go out with friends frequently, I meet quite some new people. But there just never seems to be a woman that I hit it off with. The few cases where I got immediately interested on the first meeting it was either not mutual or she was in a relationship. And the (few) women who openly showed interest weren't really my type.

So I sit here, wanting a relationship for years now, but nothing is happening and I don't know what to do or change. What makes it weird is that I'm considered attractive, I'm tall, fit, educated, social, confident and I'm not shy or anything. There's nothing glaring that I can work on to improve my chances.

It's happened enough times that I seriously think something is wrong with me. These are all guys I've met on dating apps, and after three or four dates tell me they don't see a future with me but may want to continue to date casually or be fwb. 

I get my fair share of compliments, I have a great sense of humor, I'm great in bed (lots of compliments there), I am emotionally stable and have done TONS of work on myself. I communicate my feelings and I pride myself on my ability to emotionally support others. I know what I bring to the table yet no one seems to want to explore a relationship. 

I am a firm believer that a true good lasting connection takes time to build, and that dating apps seem to unnaturally expedite that in a way that is unsustainable, so I go into dates with the mindset of keeping things slow and steady.

At this point I feel like I’m obligated to try to show that I don’t have commitment issues, that I’m not a fuck boy and I’m not psychotic.

What are my reasons for a lack of a relationship? 

A combination of… 

-Very low self esteem due to bullying from a young age. 

-Focusing on getting into law school.

- Battling and beating cancer is high school and focusing on my health and school. 

- witnessing my mother face 23 years of vicious domestic violence from my father. This led to me vowing from a young age that I would not turn into my father but it led to me being afraid of asking women out because I felt like I was harassing them. 

In terms of where I’m at now in my life, me and my mother are completely safe, happy and we are living our best lives! I’m in law school full time and working at a coffee shop part time. 

I have been trying to address and deal with my trauma on my own from and young age and have had therapists tell me they’re surprised that psychologically, I’m okay.

Despite the trauma, I’m super outgoing and love talking to people including women and I also have a good physique as I regularly weightlift and am disciplined with my diet

2830,my fwb is so distant when it comes to communicating plans,"i’ll give you some background first. me (22F) and this guy (23M) dated from February till May so we dated for about 3 months and we weren’t going anywhere romantically. the sex was always amazing and that’s the best thing about our relationship. i’ve known him since October and we have been casual friends before we started dating. his ex girlfriend of 4 years broke up with him, i don’t know the reason but she did and it took him a long time to get over her, which i think was one of the big factors in why we didn’t get together romantically because he wasn’t over her.

so recently, we’ve both realised that we’re not going to pursue a romantic relationship and that the sex is one of the best things between us so we recently decided to become friends with benefits only 2 weeks ago with no exclusivity so we are both free to date other people. both of us have started dating other people since, the girl he is dating now, they have been close friends for a while and they have similar sense of humour and she is very pretty. i’m happy for him, they definitely seem very compatible but he said that he is still happy to be FWB’s with me. i’m bisexual and the girl that i’m dating is poly and she has a partner so she is fine with my situation as well. i could be poly myself so i’m also fine. however he is very distant and very bad at communicating. he is meant to go to canada for the summer but now he probably won’t be going because of the wildfires, and i asked him to keep me updated if he would be going or not, and he said he would. 

however, he hasn’t texted me or talked to me since i last saw him which was a week ago and i feel really weirded out by this. i know that he’s dating this other girl and I’m happy for him but he should really initiate more contact, because i feel that i am the one who is initiating all the contact and i don’t want to be friends with benefits with him if that’s the case. he rarely initiates contact with me which makes me very confused about what he actually wants. i got the feeling i was a rebound from his previous relationships. i don’t know what to do. should I talk to him about this and tell him how I feel? i know a lot of you will probably say that the situation is unhealthy and i know it is to a great extent. however, the sex is really good and he is a genuinely nice person. should i just tell him how i feel and that it might be strange to continue being friends with benefits if he gets more serious with the girl that he’s dating? he said that it’s very casual and very early days so that’s why we’re still friends with benefits. however i think i should talk to him about how I feel and should I ask him to initiate more contact me if he wants to continue being friends with benefits, because i think he needs to initiate more contact because I don’t like being the main one to initiate things with him.

the divorce of my parents was especially draining for me because they had shared custody (i was 6 when they divorced) and i was forced to spend time with my dad’s new girlfriend aka the woman my dad cheated with. i hated her guts. she knew that and still tried to coddle up to me. i’ve always been really close with my mom and it still sends me into a rage today whenever i think about how such a wonderful woman was wronged.

my grandma also had a very public and loud fallout with my grandpa when she found out he cheated after 30 years of marriage which i unfortunately witnessed.

now, i think all this could’ve impacted me and my dating life. or the lack thereof. i’ve never really been able to open up enough to actually date anybody. whenever i got close to someone and i felt it getting more serious i backed out immediately. all i desire is a loving healthy relationship with someone who i can trust. but my brain keeps telling me those men do not exist and men are programmed to eventually cheat. like i’m serious, i believe there’s no such thing as a loyal man. i suspect this might be because i’ve never witnessed a healthy relationship in my family. i want commitment but run away out of fear of being betrayed.
 
you can’t change the past and the things you’ve gone through but is there a way to let go of or work on these trust issues? i really WANT to believe there are good, loyal men out there but it’s difficult… especially in my generation with the hook up culture and the rise of polygamy.",dating

2833,"3 dates, 1 month of chatting, now what","Met this girl at a bbq, we've been chatting for a month already and been on 3 dates , kissed on the last one (she said it was her first kiss ever) a saturday ago. We're both quite busy with college and stuff and we live in different towns. She gave me her number 10 days ago after chatting on Instagram. We usually exchange around 10 messages a day, but don't know what should I do next. I still don't really know if she's interested, we're both quite shy and don't know if asking her out may sound clingy or needy to her. How should I proceed?",dating
2834,throw away account - I feel stupid for thinking he was interested in me and have no idea how to interpret his message. Need advice!,"I met this guy a little over a month ago now and I feel a bit silly and stupid now for thinking he was seriously interested in me.

All of our dates had been amazing, he is such a good guy and so kind and beautiful, respectful, funny, smart and great at communicating and clearly has healthy boundaries. He is literally everything I’ve been looking for (even though in the past I never wanted to admit it) - I definitely already have some kind of feelings for him. 

I was really excited because on our upcoming date we were supposed to have ‘the talk’, I was ready to confess that I had developed feelings, I had bought him flowers (nothing too fancy) and two hours before our date he cancelled as he tested positive for covid and was feeling pretty sick. He’s supposed to be leaving to go away for a week and is resting to try get better before he leaves (which I thought was reasonable). 

Anyway we had a little bit of a chat over text about things, it was very brief and he said he would rather talk in person about it and explain more. 

This is the message he sent me though briefly explaining where his head was at - 

“I guess I’m in a funny spot personally which is why it’s easier to talk about it when we see eachother - but I guess the short kinda version is that I value human connection, but have had a recent breakup and still finding my feet as to what it means to exist as me. There’s a balance between friends uni and spending intimate time and I’m cautious of tipping that in a way which edges back to responsibility and expectation from a partner. It sounds shitty when I put it like that but I don’t feel as though I’ve had enough time to value and be ready for something like that again. Probably more confusing again sorry - and maybe not the most coherent. I do like spending time with you but yeah, feel like maybe it’ll be less confusing in person”

It was a pretty confusing message to receive, he has been pretty affectionate with me, has pet names he calls me, does really sweet things for me, etc. In fact he was the one who approached me and asked me out when we met, I wasn’t even that interested in him and thought we had just had a good chat and now I have feelings for him. I hate that I’m in this situation now because I really like him and really want things to work out. 

When we met and had exchanged numbers and what not, from the beginning I said I didn’t just want a hookup and wanted something more. He said he really liked me so far and wanted to see how we would gel and and that he didn’t particularly have any overarching intentions. 

I guess now I’m feeling pretty stupid for thinking he was interested in a relationship, perhaps I’m reading the message wrong, I don’t know. 

Very very rarely do I feel like this about someone and this comfortable so I don’t want to just throw it away and end it. I’m not sure what to do now. We agreed we will be having a talk when he’s back from his trip but that won’t be for another week or so. Now I’m worried if I tell him how I feel it’ll just scare him off. I don’t want him to feel like I’m a responsibility or that I have serious expectations like he mentioned. I’m not even 100% what I want, all I know is I have some kind of feelings for him, I really like him, I don’t usually feel this way about people (especially so fast?) and I want something more than just a FWB/hookup type thing. 

For context we have had 3 very very long dates and have been talking with each other pretty much every single day for about a month now! I also slept with him on the second date, it was my first time ever sleeping with a guy, as previously I had only ever slept with girls. So that was kind of a big deal for me which I did express to him and he was very respectful and kind about it all. As far as I know he hasn’t been seeing anyone else either. 

Someone please advise me!",dating

2837,How should I end this “relationship”?,"I (28M) started seeing this girl (26F) and I’ve been on a couple of dates with her. The first date was fine and fun, the 2nd date was a bit awkward (she was supposed to stay the night but ended up staying the weekend with me), she’s told me that guys usually break up with her because she’s “boring”. I don’t find her boring, honestly I thought we had a really good connection at first, but after spending some time together I’ve realized that she makes it hard for me to be myself around her. While she stayed at my place she basically criticized my kitchen and ingredients (I know they’re not the best but she seemed really bothered by this, like she tried to make spaghetti and was unhappy that I had a jar of spaghetti sauce vs fresh ingredients, and we didn’t even eat the spaghetti because she was so upset by it), and at one point we were kind of just sitting in silence awkwardly, so I asked what she felt like doing and her response was “what do you usually do on the weekends?”. I was honest and told her “at this point I’m usually just stoned, vibing to music, and playing video games or going for a walk” she expressed she had no interest in any of those things but was fine to sit in my apartment and scroll through her phone if I wanted to do that. On our 2nd date she also asked if we could be exclusive (I didn’t have a problem with this because I liked her, but also 2 dates seemed a little early to be asking), and when I told her I wanted to slow things down and get to know each other better before jumping into a relationship (on our first date) she was also upset by this.

But I reached out to her and asked if she wanted to go with me to a festival cause my sister is trying to sell both her tickets. She said she'd LOVE to but can't go cause of work, and also mentioned not knowing how her bf would feel about it.

I said I understand and apologized for not knowing if she had a bf or not, otherwise I'd probably not have asked.

2841,Something wrong with my personality?,"So I'm a 23 year-old guy who has never had luck with dating, so far. Since eternity, I have always expected myself to be very likeable by the opposite sex, but life has been drastically different and it seems every other guy except me is achieving this better. 

I am regularly attending meetups, and I have attended them atleast 12 times in the last 5 months. Most of them were board gaming 
themed. 

I have had women initiate greetings with me, asking my name after a game, and sometimes appreciate my moves in the game. Yet, there's never been anything that suggests me women being interested to date me. 

On another subreddit I had read that improving of personality is an advice only given to people in whom no women seem to be interested. I used to think that my personality is fairly good enough and in fact a girl who met me online and possibly liked me as well, herself told me that my personality is really good. Besides this, I've been sometimes been called a gem for being a good listener, other time someone with whom I was willing to pursue something casual told me I'm very charming and sweet, and that it'll be very easy to find someone to fall in love with me. There have been other points of appreciation for me as well which would make this part unnecessarily lengthy. 

But seeing that I have had a strong history of interacting with women and none of them showing interest in dating makes me wonder if my personality is not as good as I have been thinking.

So, I’m in my late 30’s and it has become painfully clear that I may not ever expierence love and it is just breaking me!
I promise, I’m not always this much of a sad, I’m just venting and getting out all the sadness and shame I have.

But I am scared I’ll end up alone, I’m an only child, very small family, I don’t have any close, strong friendships, they all kind of fall away when they got partners/kids and didn’t have time/interest in me anymore.

I feel so worthless, unlovable, ugly and it’s just seems like I’m being punished with having to watch everyone else move with their lives and getting what I also want, except I’m never good enough. 

Few years ago this topic/loneliness pushed me to be pretty suicidal, I saw a counselor, it helped a bit, I talked to them as much as I could about this - I wasn’t 100% honest, because I was too shamed to admit I’ve never been in a relationship and that I can’t have sex, so I was bit vague. He was very much ”you’ll never know what will happen, anyone can meet anyone at anytime” line of thinking, so not very helpfull in a long run, but it was good to be able to talk at least a bit.

I know that he likes more serious types of situations/ relationships, and I only do serious relationships (I only had one boyfriend so far and our relationship lasted for just over 1 year). We have similar humours apparently ( we are both a little awkward so we have not been making too many jokes hahah), have very similar interest and in general a lot of things in common. He is also extremely attractive but I was told that he has no game/rizz. I have 0 clue if he is interester, he doesn´t seem to make any proper moves except for smiling a lot to me whenever we make eye contact...  
  
Should I even make a move? Do guys like it when a girl kind of makes a move out of nowhere? Should I make a move now before the summer break or should I wait for September at Uni?

2850,How Much Did You Lose by Not Dating in High School/College?,"Tl;Dr not dating during school was a mistake 



I remember the first two kids to start dating in my class. It was in the 5th grade, and one of my worst bullies started dating another one of our classmates. It was still pretty weird in 5th grade, but by 8th grade, it wasn't weird to have dated someone. By 12th grade, it was weird not to have dated someone. Most people had learned the basics of dating—first kisses, emotional breakups, etc. Except for me.

I was hoping that I would be able to make up for lost time quickly in college, but that didn't happen. I was obese, and I knew that every girl I would've asked would've said no. Now, at 27, I'm worrying that none of it will ever happen to me. That worries me for a lot of obvious reasons, but lately, my major concern is simple:

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I've occasionally had some dates on dating apps.  But they went nowhere. Only one has multple meetings. But eventually she got tired of me not knowing what to do.(she had to ask me if I was ever going to kiss her instance)

Were I to suddenly find myself in a relationship, I would probably know more than most people do when they find their first SOs, but that's only because I'm 12 years older and have read a lot about it. But I missed out on a ton of normal learning experiences, and I don't know things that people are just supposed to know. Maybe even worse, I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HOW I HANDLE RELATIONSHIPS. I don't know what my dating level is, I don't know how to deal with my anxieties, and I don't know how to deal with my emotions. It's like someone starting high school after missing elementary and middle schools. I'm so screwed.

Moreso than the opportunity loss by not dating in college, not having or keeping friends from college also mostly damns you to spend most of (usually, at best) the rest of your life without friends, and therefore without the social inertia that comes with being able to socialize through mutual friends and meet more people that way. I lost all of my social inertia/capital. I have nothing, nothing to build a real social life on.",dating

I started seeing a dentist. He is close to my age, we are both in our 20's. He has shown signs of attraction to me and i can feel my face get hot when he talks to me, but its only when he says / does certain stuff.  I'll bullet point it out

- new patient visit, i have 2 cavities. Hes kind to me. Gets to know me, when i leave he stares at me from his office until i leave. 

- i get fillings from him. Hes encouraging with the needle and tells me im doing great .. blah blah. Then he teases me about how scared i was. (Pretty normal)

- routine cleaning. He jokingly leans my chair all the way back and towers over me to ask if im falling yet. Haha. funny. I have no cavities. He told me hes proud of me and i would get a prize if i was a kid. He reviews my x rays and tells me he has 3 wisdom teeth as well. And one is partially formed just like mine. I have recently started working in dentistry as well and he expressed that made him ""really happy"". And told me the doctors better be nice to me, or he'll talk to them for me (lol)

- i go again because my wisdom teeth erupted. This time he comes out front while im waiting in the waiting room just to stare at
Me while im in the waiting room. Then, when i get my exam done, he calls me cute for only having 3 teeth, says he remembered that, and repeats again saying its adorable. Refers me to surgery, Then he grabs my shoulder a little and says ""sorry i know you really wanted me to take out your wisdom teeth"" .

my friend who sees the same doctor says he treats her completely differently than what i describe , and he only does this when nobody is present. Im not gonna pursue anything like this i just want to know if im crazy or if he is starting to breach ethical codes.

I (35M) have an awkward situation with my coworker (26F), and it's all my fault. I should have really heeded the advice ""Don't shit where you eat""... but we are where we are.  
  
I've been in the company for 6 years, I'm quite senior and really enjoy my job. She has been in the company for around 2 and a half years. When she first joined the company, I was her manager for her first 6 months or so. However, this was only for onboarding / training and was during Covid so we were fully remote. I only met her in person when she'd been in the company about 1 year, and by this time I wasn't managing her anymore, and I'd moved over to a different team. Our roles are completely different now, and we rarely need to interact day-to-day. We are also only in the office 2 days a week. We also sit at opposite ends of the office when we are in.  
  
We've always had a good working relationship. Over the last year, since being back in the office 2 days a week, we've gotten to know each other a bit more. I never considered pursuing her before, because we work together and I used to be her manager. However, over the last few months, we started having a bit of playful banter / flirting on the company instant messenger... not that often, but maybe once every couple of weeks while we're both in the office.  
  
We also had a couple of 1-1 in-person meetings during the working day. During those meetings, she opened up to me about a few things that annoyed her about the company. There was also the occasional canteen conversation during lunchtime. I felt there was always a slightly sarcastic and playful vibe between us, and she always seemed to laugh at my jokes. I began to like her.  
  
She never socialises outside work with anyone - she's always out of the door by 5pm, so I never got much chance to talk to her properly. But in the office, she always seemed to smile when she walked passed me. One of my colleagues commented that I’m the only person she seems to like / talk to.  
  
A couple of months ago, I Whatsapped her just after she left the office for the day on a Friday, saying ""I need a drink"", because I'd had a tough day. We don't message outside work normally, so this was crossing a new boundary. I wouldn’t normally pursue a coworker, but I really liked her and I felt it wouldn’t be a big deal since we’re only in the office 2 days a week, and rarely need to interact.  
  
She replied immediately ""Ah you should have said! I would have stayed for a drink. Not been a good day?"" Then we started messaging back and forth about work. Eventually the conversation turned to plans for the weekend. By this time, it was Saturday, and I asked if she fancied a drink tonight. She replied ""I would have but I'm dog sitting this evening for my dad, are you staying in?"" She didn't offer to do it another time.  
  
After this, the conversation ended naturally. We never spoke about the fact that I'd asked her out, but things were not awkward at work at all. If anything, we were talking on the instant messenger a bit more, still with a playful vibe. This has continued over the last couple of months.  
  
Then last week, we both finished work, and we were walking out of the door together. We had normal colleagues chitchat on the way to the station, nothing flirty. She was off to do some clothes shopping, so we said goodbye.  
  
That evening, I don't know what came over me, but I felt the urge to test the waters again. I Whatsapped her a couple of hours later saying ""How's the spring / summer collection looking?"" and we exchanged a couple of messages. Then I asked what her weekend plans were, and whether she'd like to go for a drink. She didn't respond until the next afternoon, saying ""A busy girl this weekend, got a bbq tomorrow and another on Sunday. You're too late. What are your weekend plans?"" The conversation ended naturally - I wished her a fun weekend, and she replied saying the same.  
  
Today was the first day back in the office, and I tried to be my normal self with everyone, but I felt like she was avoiding me - there was only one occasion where we interacted, when I held the door open for her, and asked how she was doing, and she replied “good thanks, just very busy”.  
  
I am totally mortified that I asked her out a second time and got shot down, because now it feels very awkward. It’s not really the rejection that bothers me… more that I was her manager in her first 6 months. After that, even though I wasn’t her manager any more, she would sometimes ask for my advice if she was stuck with something. Now, she probably thinks that our good working relationship was a lie, and that I liked her the whole time.  
  
At this point, I’m not trying to win her over and get her to like me back. I just want things to go back to how they were, when we were quite close coworkers who were friendly and playful with each other, but nothing more. Now, she knows that I really like her, and it’s awkward.  
  
How do I play it from here? Should I just act like nothing happened, treat her no differently to any other colleague, and hope that things become less awkward over time? Or should I ask her to walk and talk with me for a few minutes so I can clear the air? I would just tell her that I really value her as a colleague and friend, and I’m sorry for putting her in a difficult position. It’s just a crush I’ve developed over the last couple of months, which I will handle myself.  
  
Any thoughts welcome… and yes, I know I shouldn’t have pursued a co-worker in the first place.",dating
2861,Think I should end it but I'm too into him,"So I (28f) have been seeing this guy (29m) for about 7 months now on and off. Timing just worked out well the first two times we went out in November- first time was a brunch date, second was out for drinks. We didnt talk much before so we never established what we were both looking for. We ended up sleeping together after the second date, we were drunk and went back to his and watched a movie and started making out and it was really good, he was attentive and I liked pillow talk and cuddling with him too- not just the sex. I left in the morning and we kissed goodbye. 

From there I was a bit confused what he wanted so I think the next time we went out for drinks and hooked up at his place again I asked him what he was looking for and he said just casual but open to a relationship in the future. Christmas break came so we didnt see each other for a month. Then in Jan/Feb I was sick so again we didnt see each other. I was also a bit upset because he left me on read throughout all of the Christmas break and only texted me when I got back to our city. I told him how I felt and he apologized and said he got busy with family stuff. 

I agreed to go out again- we actually went to a really cute and fancy bar- he organized it all and remembered I mentioned I wanted to go vegetarian so he ordered only vegetarian apps which I thought was really sweet. He paid for the drinks and everything. Again we hooked up and it was amazing, then we even went out for breakfast the next morning since it was a Saturday. We talked for like 2 hours when we went out for breakfast too. I felt like we were slowly building something- texting every other day. Like yeah, he said casual but maybe he was starting to get feelings? 

So that was around March- I got busy with school since I'm in grad school and I had a crazy semester. He was going back and forth to a different state to visit his family and went on a few skii trips and stuff. So we both didnt see each other all of April and most of May. He texted me again and after talking for a bit he texted ""could really use some (kitty emoji)"" I was honestly really grossed out and just left him on read. Like why did he have to use that kind of terminology? Why not say he missed ME? 

A few weeks went by and I went out for dinner and drinks with some friends, we ended up in his area really late at night and I sort of drunk texted him if he was free and he said yeah, that I should come over. We hooked up again and it was amazing again, the guys got good sex game for sure. 

For some reason I think about him all the time. I really want to be with him but he never compliments me, he never initiates anything other than going for a drink and then hooking up. I asked him again after we had sex and we were cuddling- he said he'd be open to a relationship with ""the right girl"". It kind of crushed me. I think I even physically moved away from him. I asked him what about me makes me ""not the right girl"", and he sort of backtracked and said that he never expected me to be interested in a relationship (maybe cuz we hooked up so quickly?) He said we should keep seeing each other and go from there. 

At this point I really dont know what I want with him. The sex is great, he lives in a nice part of town that is known for iconic bars so it's always fun to go out for drinks but I caught feelings so now its hard for me to keep it just sex. He has so many qualities I'd look for in a future partner- he has a well paying job, seems ambitious about work, seems to have a good circle of friends/ is social, likes outdoorsy stuff, likes going out for drinks, good in bed, fun to talk to, good relationship with his family, seems very cultured, etc. I'm so conflicted. Should I let him go?",dating
2862,How do I [24M] properly process my feelings for a lady [25F] I really like but not *currently* attracted to? Can I really expect change?,"TL;DR
Met girl from app. Hit it off completely (both calls and text), so we met up for dinner. Her pictures were from when she was thinner. She struggled with weight due to an abusive father who she still lives with. She’s mildly attractive still despite her weight. As someone who’s been overweight I get it but I’m just not attracted to overweight women. I told her that i’m very health focused and she was sad but was willing to work on it. Can I really expect someone to change? Am I trapping myself in something I shouldn’t? 


Full post 
I have been talking to this girl for roughly 2 weeks. We initially met through a dating app and our conversation was never dull. We had a few calls before meeting up since there’s some distance between us and we had to force ourselves to end the calls because they could easily last hours. I had a feeling she was going to be overweight from her pictures, since they just looked slightly older. 

When we met up for dinner I tried to ignore her weight and just focus on her character. I really enjoyed my time out with her and decided not to end things but instead bring the topic up once i got home. I told her that i’m a very health focused person and I want to be with someone who is the same. She immediately asked “are you calling me fat?” and I just replied with “as someone who’s been overweight for a large portion of my life idk the right answer to that, but I see myself caring about you and part of that means your health is in my best interest” which she seemed pretty receptive to, even though I can tell it made her sad. 

later that night we’re in a call and she tells me that she struggled with weight her entire life because of her father. who she still lives with because of today’s outrageous cost of living and her still being in a masters program. apparently her dad doesn’t believe in exercise and is extremely controlling. if he sees her in the neighborhood going for a run he raises hell. he has to know when and where she is at all times so she just doesn’t feel comfortable going to a gym because she has to jump through hurdles to do that. I really do feel for her and it’s an awful situation to be in. 

part of me wants to try and help but there’s only so much I can do. yes I like her and she checks every single box except that one box. but can I actually expect someone to lose weight just because I asked? at the same time how do I even know if her losing weight is they key to finding her attractive? yes in pictures she was attractive but who knows how she would actually look in person? i’m genuinely struggling to end things with someone I like this much over weight but I want to be happy and have a partner I find attractive at the same time. how do I process these feelings and move forward for my/our best interest?",dating

For the last couple of weeks I have caught myself pulling back a lot and getting annoyed easily. Now I feel like I need to break it off. I feel like I have been seeing a lot of insecurities lately and I feel like he looks to me for validation a lot more than he should. Almost as if if I'm not 110% happy with us he can't be happy or something. I also have come to the realization that I do not like his dog. I would never ask him to change his dog for me or to get rid of him. That's his child in a way. I also don't want to live with the dog or be around him for long periods of time. He always says he's a good dog but he has no manners, is almost uncontrollable on a leash and is constantly doing things ""he knows not to do"". Am I in the wrong for thinking this way?",dating
2866,Do i have a chance?,"Hi. I am woman in my early 20's and have never dated. Also have never really been interested in dating. But now I am and want to try and date. The thing is don't really know how it works and wheater or not anyone would actually be interested in me. I am not attractive and I don't think I have a personality that would be attractive to alot of guys. I am also very opinionated and have firm politcal beliefs. Also since i dont have any past crushes I dont really know how to go about dating or liking someone. My imidiate thought is to use dating apps. But it feels so vulnerable and I think I would feel hurt if noone is interested in me. Or at least humilated.  I wanted to ask here because it is hard to talk with my friends about it. They don't think I am ugly and don't see it as a problem, which is very sweet but I also know very biased. When you love someone you tend to see them in a better light. Also they are more conventionally attractive so I guess I feel they don't really get where I am coming from. Which isn't their fault and I don't have any negative feelings towards them. But I guess I just want to know any tips on how to start dating as someone who doesn't have any prior experience and who is not attractive. Thank you.",dating
2867,How do I (28F) avoid becoming obsessed with guy (35M)?,"I (28F) met him (35M) on an online dating platform. We’ve been out on 3 dates and I think we vibe really well, I have a lot of fun when we’re together and time goes by quickly. When I met him I was surprised because he looked even better than his photos (some of them were actually a little unflattering lol). It’s been a month since we know each other and we’ve gone out once a week. 

He always texts me first and has planned and paid for all of our dates. He sends me good morning texts and we talk throughout the day, some days a bit more than others, but communication is consistent. The only thing that stands out to me in all this is that we haven’t kissed yet, but since he continues to reach out, I think it has more to do with not finding an adequate/private time or place or shyness (I hope). 

I find myself thinking of him almost every hour of everyday and of course it doesn’t help that we’re constantly texting. Every time something happens in my life I feel like reaching out and telling him about it. I’ve held myself back a bit because it’s still way too soon and we barely know each other, but I can’t help but feel like I know him and I’m completely focused on him. I know this is not attractive to most men and they can grow bored if you show your feelings too soon or become overbearing, so I’m doing everything I can to take things casually and not overdo it, but it’s just too hard. He’s sweet, caring, handsome, we have things in common. I’m smitten. 

I’ve heard that going out on more dates helps, since we’re not exclusive yet and haven’t had the talk, but I don’t like the idea of entertaining a lot of people at once (plus I genuinely have tried and I simply haven’t developed a connection like this with anyone else). I’m scared that I won’t be able to hold back much longer, my feelings will show through and I will end up pushing him away. What can I do to control myself and not become obsessed?",dating
2868,Size matters more in Hookup Culture compared to Dating...,"I've been wanting to be in a relationship since high school and never got it.

According to them they keep getting laid cause they got experience and a big size. I'm still a virgin and have a average size of 5 inches.

2870,Feeling unloved,"I realized my title was not the point of the story, even though it is what I'm feeling. A better title would be: Dating someone who dates others.

&#x200B;

I finally met a very nice girl through mutual friends. We hung out one night, sort of dating, where she even that same night went home with me.

Afterwards we hung out another couple of times and I really started to get feelings towards her and she did towards me.

However, when I asked her about what she would be doing this summer, thinking it would be a great time to do fun things, she had other plans. The conversation then evolved into the way we were dating and seeing other people. I told her clearly that I am not interested in dating anyone else at the moment, as she was the girl of interest. I wanted to give her a clear chance in what could be something longer lasting.

She on the other hand, believed being exclusive this early would make her feel ""locked in"", as in, she wanted the opportunity to have fun and essentially do whatever while we were still dating.

This came as a surprise due to the way she had been expressing her feelings throughout the dates and between them. Hearing this I was left speechless. I started to grow actual feelings towards her and she was too, but not at the same pace.

Unfortunately I had to either choose to accept her dating, meeting, sleeping, whatever ""fun"" would imply or no longer date her. I chose no longer dating her, as it goes against everything I know and the thought of her with someone else while seeing me is killing me. Another part of this is how casually she explained that she doesn't want to be ""locked in"" and ""exclusive"" at the moment and encouraged me to do the same.

She is probably the most beautiful girl I've been with and so talented and likable, yet this was such a weird thing for me which I could not oversee.

I'm left with pain, sorrow and disgust - yet I still want her.

Was I overreacting? Is this what is normal and expected?",dating
2871,"Nervous for the second date with this girl I’ve been seeing, despite our first date/talking has been great! (A few goofs on my part)","Hi everyone, 

This Saturday, I (24 almost 25M) am having a second date with a girl (26F) that I’ve talked to off and on since Nov 2022. We finally both just asked each other out, and had our first actual date last Friday. 

It was great, dinner, making out, then we did a mutual hobby, and NSFW stuff, the whole date lasting about 5 hours. 

She’s incredibly attractive, smart, funny, kind, and she thinks I’m handsome, funny, smart etc. 

As we had been talking off and on for months before actually “dating” we know each other pretty well I’d say, and she is checking a lot of good boxes for me. 

I don’t want to rush into things with her, but I also really like her, would want exclusively date her, (not ask her to be my GF yet.) When is the best time to ask her to be exclusive? (I ask this, as I haven’t been in the dating/relationship scene for almost a year, so I’m not sure on the best timeline to proceed on.) 

How do I stop being nervous about seeing her again? It’s clear she likes me, she agreed to a second date. My anxiety is just racing, thinking I’ll torpedo a chance at a third date/going exclusive with her. 

A lot of my anxiety stems from the fact that we were talking yesterday after work, and I accidentally called her “babe.” I apologized/felt horrible and she teased me saying she probably  wouldn’t cancel on Saturday. 

Then I was getting ready for bed, I asked her, “So Saturday will be a (mutual hobby) and cuddle kind of date right?” Her response: “Yes, but only if I get a kiss first. :)” 

“Deal :)” I said, then we said goodnight.

I am 32 yo, 5'7, in shape and maybe a little more than average looking face wise.

In parallel I have tinder gold running with some decent photos , I get a few ok matches but it's hard and especially boring to get an actual date.

On the other hand with cold approaching I am able to get instant dates with women I am definitely attracted to, having fun in the process and some of these dates can sometimes lead to sex the same day (not that frequent but yes it happens).

Otherwise I am getting numbers and able to convert a decent amount of these into actual dates.

She is really bad at dating, no flirting, terrible communication, and lack of a sense of wanting coming from her. 

I have spoken to her about it and she has gotten much better. I know it's difficult being this old and never being intimate so I knew there would be a learning curve. Also doesn't help that I'm pretty clingy.

Anyway I am asking for advice on dating someone like this. I don't mind waiting until she is comfortable to do anything and all that. I'm more curious for advice on what to expect from her down the road.

2880,"Tried dating a man from my own culture for a change, everything I hate about my culture surfaced","I'm a second generation immigrant woman, my parents migrated from Bangladesh. Throughout my adulthood (I'm now in my late 20s) I always avoided dating men from my background, the psychology would say it's because I found parts of my culture harsh or traumatic which is why I distanced myself from it in my relationships. The men that I did date always caused my parents to become upset, the men were never Bangladeshi or Muslim (my parents are observing Muslims, I consider myself an atheist, or at most a lapsed Muslim). It would cause tension and always cause us to inevitably break up as my parents would accuse me of bringing shame on to the family, or bringing someone in who didn't care for our heritage. 

So I gave a fellow 2nd gen immigrant Bangladeshi man a chance. The red flags were as follows:

1. As I was reluctant to share my Instagram with him (from past experience, fellow Bangladeshis always judge you for what you wear, who your friends are and whether you drink). He said this was an ""amber flag"", and then proceeded to outline in great detail a picture of me he saw. Like he forensically outlined a picture of me wearing something ""revealing"". He said he didn't care about how women dress, but he was concerned this picture was public. So clearly he did care. He said it would be a red flag if we started following each other, and with my locked Instagram profile open on his phone in front of him, and he saw the amount of posts reduce, it would be a problem. 

2. We matched on bumble. But he got upset that I had ""apparently matched with a non Muslim guy which ""made me uncertain about things like any previous dating history"". Meanwhile he was on Tinder. Like literally Wtaf

3. He asked me out for dinner / our third meeting, weeks in advance, checking in every other day we were still on. At dinner he boasted about his forthcoming 40% salary increase, about how he could afford to spend £30,000 on renovations on a property he was about to buy. When the bill came, he jumped at my offer of splitting a £24 pizza meal. He would later claim it was because I gave off independent vibes. 

4. I told him I wasn't interested; he asked me to reconsider but that I was welcome to block him on WhatsApp. I did that but then he sent me an SMS message. He told me he was sad, feeling lost and confused. 

Everything I hate about my culture surfaced with this one dude within a few dates / few weeks. I hate to be so judgemental and internalise stereotypes but this is precisely why I hate dating Bangladeshi men. I know they're not all like this, but the very things I wanted to avoid appeared in one of the only few Bangladeshi men I've ever given a chance to.

2881,How to deal with this ?,"So whenever it comes to likening a girl is not gonna lie I tend to get clingy I don’t know why it’s how I am. Unfortunately that is not an attractive trait to have and even worse I tend to catch feelings quick. 
 
So just bad combinations all around, there’s nothing worse then caring for someone very deeply only for them not to care for you. Even worse when there might have been some potential there early on.

I like this girl but it’s clear she’s no longer interested but I’m having some trouble moving on. People tend to say there’ll be other girls or find another girl but when you’re not a chick magnet like me. Cute girls come far and very few between.

 Maybe that’s why I’m so clingy anyway one how do I get over this girl and two how do I stop being clingy when it come to taking to girls in terms of a relationship. I’ve noticed when I’m not approaching things fora relationship and more so just for a quick hookup I tend to not care as much and the girls I do end up talking to seem to be the clingy ones in those situations.

Even if we start a relationship, it would be long distance (1-3 hour drive depending on where she’s at).

Girl B: we’ve been talking for a few weeks now and are planning on meeting up over the weekend. We have a lot of common interests and overall similar personalities. We haven’t really talked about relationship stuff, but for what it’s worth, her profile said she’s looking for a long-term relationship. The distance would be much closer between us (30 minute-1 hour drive depending on where she’s at).

Even though all signs point to Girl B being a much more satisfying relationship and being more interested in general, I can’t help but feel in my gut that I’m currently more interested in Girl A. My friend said that it’s because I’ve been talking to Girl A more and am just more comfortable with her, but if I had been talking to Girl B the same amount of time as Girl A, I don’t know if that would be true. The way I see it, I feel more comfortable and attracted to Girl A, but have more in common with Girl B and am currently more able to be myself with her.

Why am I so caught up with Girl A even though it’s more likely not to happen? I don’t understand why I can’t just let Girl A go and focus on Girl B",dating

I would like to add that i am diagnosed with some sort of mental illnesses but i don't know if I have them because i dated these (sometimes narcissistic) men and they left me traumatized or I dated these men because I am mentally ill or its just coincidence

2891,Keeping interest from others and being intriguing.,"I've (31m) often thought about this topic throughout my entire dating life. How do you keep interest from someone?

I have the mindset of being genuine and passionate about hobbies and beliefs in life will help. I also go along the lines of actually being interested in and actively listening to other people.

However, my insecurities come in this form: I have hobbies and passions, but I don't think I have the deepest thoughts nor am I the best at my hobbies. I do them for me and find the joy there. I feel like as we get older, though, it is impressive and almost expected in the dating world to have something you're really good at.

I've been striking out left and right in dating recently. Most, save for a couple, of my potential partners have stuck around for about a month or so worth of dates to get to know me and vice-versa. Getting rejected and not being compatible is bound to happen. However, only one has stuck around to turn into a long-term relationship. Usually, just stops at a casual physical relationship. Is it because I'm boring? Maybe. I don't know. I never get that feedback even when asking.

I hate the idea of faking passion just to be court jester for someone, but at what point is a person just boring?

Is the average person labeled as boring? Are standards nowadays higher than they should be because of online dating and social media? How do you keep someone interested in you? Am I wrong for becoming insecure about this? I often wonder, at my age, should I have done more by now? I know we're all on different life paths, but maybe mine that lacks some experiences is a turn off for potential partners.",dating

Working extra hard and out of town a lot this summer just trying to put myself in an ok spot financially. 
I went on a date with a fella a Few days ago. Great convo, went on for 3 hours. Walked me to my car. Now radio silence.

2893,Am I the problem?,"I am noticing a pattern with my recent girlfriends and partners within the past few years. 

1: Start dating, and ask about intentions. Find an agreement on said intentions. If not, do not proceed. 

2: Start bonding emotionally, physically, or sexually. At this point, attachment seems good from both sides. We text all the time, and make time to see each other every weekend.

3: My partner will just get distant, flat out say they don't want a relationship, try to offer an FWB status, or break up with me on and off. 

I don't understand why stage 3 is happening. 

My buddies who were friends with my recent ex, said that ""She is not used to having someone who cares about her well being, and checks up on her every day"".

2898,I 21M got dumped over a year ago and wanted advice on how to get back into dating,"Hey guys, I'm (21M) and a little over a year ago I got out of an almost 4-year relationship that ended up being very toxic in the last 6 months. The reason for our breaking up can be boiled down to her wanting to experience the hookup culture in our college and I wanted to stay with her because of how much I thought I loved her at the time and we were a very compatible couple before the covid lockdown got lifted. Not gonna lie back then I was a very reactive person especially when it came to her because, at the time I just couldn't believe my gf wanted to become a ""Miami 304"" Yes, I live in Miami. In the beginning, after our break up I started ""talking"" to a few girls but for the most part, I ended things because I realized that I was just jumping into a relationship with someone who was similar to my ex more or less. A year since then I have gone to therapy to get over the breakup and now I'm comfortable with starting a new chapter with someone else but I find it hard to approach women around my campus because I don't want to come off as another fuckboy who just wants them for their body, or a weirdo who is desperate for attention. For most of my life, my relationships stem from friendships that evolve into a relationship but now that I am an adult I realized that that doesn't work as well because nowadays it is so easy for you to get stuck in the friend zone. For the most part, I'm not a bad-looking guy, I'm a bit chubby but for the most part, I carry my weight well and since going to the gym more and more I look like a powerlifter or a Football Player, I've had professors assume that I am a student-athlete. Not that looks are that important but sometimes around campus, I catch the gaze of some girls and I notice the cues for ""Hey, I wouldn't mind if you approach me"". But due to my autism (figuratively speaking, I'm not actually diagnosed with it) I usually don't capitalize on those chances of making a connection with someone new. My outlook on dating as of right now is jaded due to the toxic Miami culture and I know I'm not alone in this but I just want some advice on how I can start approaching women (I've never done it in my life), where to meet them around campus because I refuse to meet women at the club or bar those types of girls just waste your time. And I know most of you are going to say just focus on yourself king, spend time with your friends, and don't focus on dating, but I've been doing that for over a year now, and I do love every moment I spend with my friends but the lonely nights are getting to me and I don't want to go off the deep end where I just give up altogether and the only companionship I have is with my pet cat.

I am a 25F and there is someone at my gym that I am interested in. I haven't approached because yes, I am scared of rejection, but I am also very scared of the person saying they are younger than me. I know it may seem like a weird fear to have, but I guess I would just feel like a creep if they were younger and I would want to crawl in a hole. 

To describe myself, I consider myself pretty attractive and have been told so for pretty much my whole life. I have never been rejected, but I have only gotten back into dating this year, and its weird for me. I suppose that is why it is anxiety provoking for me.

2907,Told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person.,"I've been repeatedly told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person because I'm confrontational and argumentative, and that I'm not a wonderful person.  But he's also told me that I'm kindhearted.

Being told that I'm unpleasant makes me feel like I'm not worthy of having friends or a romantic relationship, because people will come to disrespect me in time and not want to be around me.  My dad is the only person in my life who's told me many times that I'm unpleasant and annoying.  I have a history of being called names by him, and him talking down to me and mocking me.

I still live with my dad.  I am twenty-nine years old.

Being told I'm unpleasant has made me question my worth and think that I don't deserve friends or a romantic partner.  That I can be nice, but that maybe that's a facade for the bad person I actually am.  I don't know how I ought to take my dad's statement, but he's often told me sarcastically that ""I'm a wonderful person"" and that I'm ""great"".  It makes me think that maybe I'm actually a piece of shit.

2908,ghosted after 4 dates,"so I (24f) started speaking to this guy (24m) about a month ago. we started off messaging a fair bit, a least a few messages everyday, and met up 4 times - these involved going for a drink, going for a drive or coming over to play video games (nothing intimate happened apart from cuddling on the last date). Everytime we met we connected so well, we would be talking and laughing for hours, I really had hope that this person might be 'different', we had lots of common goals like he wanted a relationship and eventually marriage, and we seemed to be able to communicate our issues well . For example, When he goes out with friends he could not message me for 24 hours, and one week he barely messaged me at all, to then be very apologetic and I explained that I found this triggering and explained my rejection/ abandonment issues and he really seemed to understand and we had an in depth conversation about communication and our issue's etc and it seemed to be solved. I should also mention this guy hates social media and texting so I tried to understand this as to why he not message as frequently. Anyway, fast forward to the day after we last met up, I had a lovely time and he said he did too - he even initiated making plans to meet up on the weekend. 

We messaged after the meet up and I found his messages to be slightly off with me and had long reply times, but I knew he was burnt out with work and didn't want my own insecurities to ruin anything so i didn't press anything. I messaged about the weekend plans and he just said ""okay sweet i'll let you know."" I took this to mean it was no longer a definite plan (even though it was discussed and agreed apon when we last met up). I replied quite bluntly in a way he would know I was upset (I regret this now and should've just asked if the weekend was still happening). He then replied 24 hours later confused as to why I was being blunt and said I could tell him if i was upset etc. I then explained that I reacted like that because I wasn't sure if the weekend plans were happening and I felt he was being off with me, but I was probably just overthinking it.

Another 24 hours goes by and he then replies saying it was a misunderstanding and he thought i didnt want him to come see me on the weekend, and that why this is why he hates texting all the time as it always gets misconstrued. I replied saying it was a big miscommunication mixed with my own insecurities and i do want to see him and that i know he is going through stuff (burnt out from work) and that i hope he is okay. That message has been left on delivered for 4 days. I'm travelling around a lot for uni and work at the moment so i'm only in the same city as him for part of the week, so I sent him a text this morning saying I was here til weds and to let me know if he wanted to go for a drive or anything, and that I hope he is okay (to no response).

2920,Let's Talk Herpes,"Can we talk herpes? HSV-2 genital herpes is minimally life impacting from a physical standpoint, but the psychological trauma and stigma remains unbearable. People are ignorant and cruel. Someone I love has had to deal with this trauma, and watching them struggle is a pain that I wish every day I could take away. The only thing I can think to do is to speak up and try to destigmatize what is such an undramatic, minimally impacting, and actually very common condition. It's 2023, people. 

First, know that if you live in the US, you've been programmed by the media and Big Pharma to react how you react to herpes. A 2016 Vice News exposé found that, starting in the 1970s, there is evidence that “big pharma” likely conjured up and perpetuated stigma to increase sales of a new drug. To advertise the drug, herpes had to be pushed as a disease worthy of attention, the answer to which was a sex panic. Much of the hysteria affecting the social status of herpes was then generated by the media. A 1982 TIME magazine cover labeled genital herpes “Today’s Scarlet Letter.” This is also why, conversely, there's almost no stigma around herpes in European countries. Most of Europe has long banned pharmaceutical advertising so the media manipulation to market drugs was impossible. 

So what can we all do? Shake off media manipulation and Big Pharma programming. Get educated. Educate others. Speak up to stigma. Let people live. 

Facts from Planned Parenthood, CDC, and NBC News. [Google for yourself. This isn't homework and I'm not doing a Works Cited about it.]

* Most genital herpes infections are asymptomatic or the symptoms are so mild or nonspecific that the person suffering from them doesn’t even make the mental connection. With genital herpes, between 65% and 90% of people who have it don't know they do. 

* After the initial infection, both types of herpes can stay dormant for years, and later outbreaks, if any, tend to be mild. In a few cases, it has been known to stay dormant for decades. One of the biggest myths about herpes is that patients had to have gotten it from their current partner. Stress and lowered immunity can cause the virus to activate suddenly.

* Only 10 to 15 percent of people with herpes exhibit symptoms, which may be a silver lining for the millions who unknowingly carry the virus, but it also helps it spread more easily.

* HSV-1 is more active when it infects the facial region, where it can cause cold sores; but can affect the genital region as well. There's long been a myth that this can only impact the facial region. It's incorrect. 

* CDC states that, among Americans 14 to 49 years old, 1 out of 5 women and 1 out of 9 men have a genital HSV-2 infection. Because that stat doesn’t count genital HSV-1 infections, the overall number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.

* Herpes medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, which greatly decrease rates of asymptomatic shedding and outbreaks. 

* Unlike other STIs, the CDC doesn't even recommend a regular test for herpes as it is not life threatening [except to infants] and diagnosing genital herpes has not been shown to change sexual behavior. Alongside the risk of false positives, “the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.”

* mRNA technology has opened up the door for vaccines, and Moderna is currently developing one to treat herpes. In the near future, it’s possible that people will be prevented from ever getting herpes and that those with it won’t have to suffer through outbreaks anymore. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Keith Jerome began exploring the idea that lifelong infections with herpes viruses might be cured by using the DNA-cutting tools of gene therapy. He is on record stating that we may be as close as 3-5 years away.

2922,"I F44 was dating a M 46, it was going well & blanked should I message again?","I F44 been seeing this guy M46, he seemed nice, like a good guy which is a rarity for me. We had made plans for when he came back from a family wedding that he was away for, a few days. 

I hadn’t heard from him while he was away but dropped him a message when he got back. He did respond but very dry, I didn’t think much of it as he’s had a long drive back & it would have been a full on weekend catching up with family. 

I tried a funny message the next day to try & get the conversation going but nothing. The day after we were meant to be doing something so I get he didn’t want to. I just don’t understand why he can’t just say so, I even said in a message that if you don’t want to talk it’s fine but it was ignored & he replied to a funny message but dryly.

I’m in my 40s, I don’t have any family & 2 friends but they only bother with me when they want to. So I looked forward to chatting to him, the dates weren’t amazing but good & funny & he seemed nice & the chat was good. 

I get that I’m probably coming across desperate but I’m honestly not, maybe I am but I’d be happy if it was the odd silly chat but at least say to me, instead of ignoring me. We live in the same small town & will likely bump into each other so why make it awkward.

2924,Gifting on a first date?,"I have a first date with a guy tomorrow who I've hit it off with and seem to have a lot of interests and values in common with - one of them being reading. 

He told me he's into mystery books and I have soooo many sitting around my house that I don't read as I work for a book publisher and get sent books all the time. Is it weird to just be like ""hey here's a book, in case you might be interested?""

2925,Levels of Cleanliness,"As many of us have realized, every relationship has a clean partner and a not as clean partner. 

Well, my gf is not a very clean person. Hell, I cannot sugar coat it, her house is absolutely filthy. It is getting so bad; I only bring myself to go over once a week.  I have her come over to my place as much as possible. But since she has pets at home, it is a rare occasion. 

She has 12 pets. 2 dogs, 2 cats and 8 birds. As well as having 2 kids, 13f & 10m, who refuse to help around the house.  I have tried to talk to them about helping their mom around the house and they both came back with ""it is not my job."" Now I do not think it is my place to tell her kids what to do in their house. But every time I go visit her place, I feel that I need clean. It is beyond a courtesy at this point.  

It is an extremely frustrating experience. Whenever I have her and her kids over, I make sure my place is presentable and clean. 

I hate eating there. There is animal hair is all over the place. If she hands me a utensil, dish, or cup, it is usually dirty. Everything use I have to wash. it has gotten to the point that when I get there cleaning her kitchen is usually my first task. Washing dishes, drying them, and putting them away. It always takes me a while because the sink is normally filled. 

Then I clean the floors. I do not take off my shoes, when I walk around her house. My feet turn black. If I wear socks, they get filled with animal hair. When I get home, I just toss my socks because there is no getting all the hair out of them. No matter how many times I wash them. Plus, the hair gets stuck on other clothes.  

I sweep and mop the kitchen, dining room, and living room. That usually helps with the smell of feces for most of the house. But then I have to empty the litter boxes to really get rid of the smell. I buy her scented candles and other air fresheners. But the lingering smell of poo is always there. 

And do not get me started on her laundry habits. It is sad and horrendous what she does to those loads.  I have not smelled a towel at her place that does not smell like it was left in the washer for a day or two before being dried. She is better with clothes. But folding them is another issue all together. 

She is a great person in all other aspects. She is extremely kind and giving and generous to where it is almost financially detrimental. If she were not so amazing, I would have left her long time ago.  

I have my own place. I work hard to maintain it and keep it up. But I know I will never want to live with her, unless things change. Because that will be my life for the foreseeable future.

Should I break it off now or stick it out because and cats and dogs do not live forever?",dating

In the course of last 3 moths i fell in love with her, but there is a problem, she is a lesbian. At first i tried to shake of my feelings for her, then she started flerting with me, I started to flert back, then we shake it of with she is a lesbian. We do it almost everyday. A few nights ago we were walking through the city, and there was some issue on the street and she decided to give me a hand all of the sudden. And i noticed a few times she looks at me in a funny way, also comments on my look what should i do better and what suits me better. We also have same braclet with ,,His mouse/Her cat,, and it started as a joke but now we wear it daily. I really dont know what to do, i love her as the person and im really attracted to her personality, she is the girl i was always dreaming off.

2931,Guy spent a year and a half maintaining correspondence with me despite having no interest in me romantically or platonically?,"I'm sorry in advance for the length!

I (36F) met this guy (33M) last year when he reached out to me on social media. We'd followed each other for a while but had never interacted. We hit it off and when we found out we lived close to each other he said we should meet up when the weather got nicer. We continued talking for a few months, he asked me lots about myself, remembered everything I told him, he was upfront about the fact that he was attracted to both women and men, I was cool with that, and eventually we met up. First meeting was pleasant, if not a bit awkward, as we both have anxiety. When we parted, he said he would be going on vacation soon. He surprisingly kept in touch with me the entire time he was gone. After he came back, we hung out again. Touch barrier was broken this time (first by me, later by him). However, the day after he went quiet. Alright...

A week or so later I suggested we hang out again, but he said was ill. Okay. A couple weeks later I asked if he wanted to do something for his birthday, and he said he was in the middle of quitting his job and he was too burnt out to meet. Okay. He was spotty with communication over the next couple months but had assured me our rapport ""would be back"". He said his burnout had really affected him.

A bit of background info on him: this is a guy with bad anxiety, low self-esteem (by his own admission), who has trouble emotionally connecting to and talking about feelings with others (by his own admission), represses emotions (by his own admission), has vaguely alluded to experiencing numerous traumas, and is working through complicated grief over the death of a parent in 2021.

I casually, kind of jokingly admitted I had a crush on him in December when we were chatting one day. He didn't respond to that...but immediately became a lot more lively and a bit flirty after I did. However, over the winter we almost stopped talking entirely. I figured that was that. Around March though, he resurfaced and the communication became a lot more frequent. He was super playful and quite chatty, back to teasing me a lot. I didn't want to broach the topic of hanging out again, though. So we're just texting this entire time. Still, he showed concern for me when I mentioned having some issues with people (telling me he'd go after them for me), offering to send me poems he'd written when I told him I would secretly love it if someone wrote me a poem (he sent them), asking about why previous relationships of mine hadn't worked out, telling me he felt close to me, sending me links to and pictures of things I was interested in, etc.

One day I told him that I felt we kept our dynamic superficial deliberately because we're both very guarded people and it's hard for us to be vulnerable. He said he agreed and that we both have ""an awareness of it (our dynamic) going deeper"". Eventually he began broaching topics about sex (never anything hardcore; he was always very respectful and careful), and one night, apropos of nothing mentioned that we'd never had sex (as if I didn't know this?). Yet we're not sexting or anything. It's just banter. 

Another day we're chatting and I say, ""Ya know, sometimes I think we care about each other more than we're willing to admit."" No answer. BUT--and I apologize for the sheer tween cringe of this--about an hour later I check my Twitter account and there are a dozen notifications from him having liked and retweeted posts of mine, all immediately one right after the other. These were posts I'd made over the course of the week, so he deliberately went to my page to do this. It's not like he was scrolling through the day's timeline and just casually liked a bunch of stuff I tweeted. And while we initially became acquainted through Twitter, we do not interact with each other's pages because we just text. I don't think he's interacted with anything I've tweeted since last year. 

Two weeks ago I casually brought up hanging out now that summer's around the corner. Nothing implied. He immediately changed the subject.

Okay, so. A few nights ago I had an intimate dream about him. When we were talking a couple days later he said he had a ""weird"" dream about me the previous night. I said I'd had a weird dream about him too. His dream involved me dating a friend of his and showing him pictures from a vacation we'd taken. He asked what my dream was about and I said we'd just hung out. The next day I playfully asked him if I'd made any appearances in any more of his dreams and he asked if he'd been in mine. I went, ""Ha, I wish"". Then I mentioned I'd left some details out of my account of my dream the day before. He asked what I left out. I said I didn't want to say what but he wanted to know and wouldn't let it go. I was coy but he could obviously tell what it was and kept insisting I tell him. He guessed that it had been a sex dream. When I said yes he said, ""Just because I'm not romantically interested in you doesn't mean I find that weird.""

We spoke about this for a bit. I told him it wasn't cool that he hadn't been upfront with me about not being interested in me, especially when he knew I was attracted to him. He said he knew it was shitty and apologized repeatedly. He did the whole, ""I try to be a good person, but I fuck up a lot, I'm sorry"" spiel.

So...I don't understand this at all. Why spend a year and a half forging this connection with me when he clearly had no intention of having it go anywhere? Like at all? Him saying he feels close to me and yet not even wanting to hang out platonically seems bizarre. I hang out with friends I have no romantic interest in all the time. I assume he does as well. I could have understood if he'd been using me to get his rocks off on the side, but that was never even a thing; we never sexted or hooked up. Why resurface after a season of not talking to me if there's nothing there? He told me he wanted me around many, many times. Yet at the same time he kept his distance. Plus, he has tons of friends and an active social life, so it's not like he needed my friendship because he was desperate for someone to talk to. And pushing me to tell him about the sexual aspects of my dream about him seems so strange. I certainly wouldn't spend a day pushing a friend to tell me about a sex dream they had about me, especially if I wasn't into them.

tl;dr: Guy spent a year and a half fostering a connection with me and dangling the prospect of something deeper only to tell me he's not interested in me immediately after getting me to tell him about a sex dream I had about him.",dating
2932,Cute guys with dogs 😭,"I feel like a shitty person for this but I’ve had such bad experiences in the past with dogs and even from owners that say “they don’t bite” that I don’t even want to be around them.  I have had a couple dates where the dog would come to me for a kiss or two on the hand  and then leave me alone which was fine and I would even warm up to them to even pet them.  But then I’ve had the bad experiences where I’m bleeding and being attacked by a dog while the owner(my date even) does absolutely nothing about it and then blames me for it.  I’m completely terrified of dog bites too because of all the stuff they get into. Went on another date and he assured me he had the best dogs and within 5 seconds of meeting the dog it jumps up and bites my hand as I was trying to shield my self.  Spent the rest of the date with the dog jumping on me as I tried to deflect blows and then later on he says that the dog loved to hunt mice and kills/eats them all the time. I spent a week after that date worries of all the diseases I could’ve contracted and I have bad anxiety. 

Finally had enough and started telling guys before I meet them that they needed to lock up the dogs if I was coming over. This didn’t go over well and I ended up making him very upset. I don’t want dogs jumping on me or possibly scratching or biting me anymore while I’m trying to enjoy a date.  And I swear dogs can sense when you’re afraid of them because they will start to get more aggressive.

2933,Feeling like I’m being used by others,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old male who is currently attending university. I have been feeling like this for a while but recently it has gotten to me more because of a situation that has happened to me a couple of days ago. I am in a society at my university. There’s this girl I really like who is also in this society. One night we were going out as it was the last social we were having together as a society. So I decided I should tell her how I feel before it’s too late. I manage to get her to walk with me alone and I tell her. She says that she feels the same way and asks why I didn’t tell her sooner. This obviously makes we very happy and we spent the whole night kissing and such (but I don’t go back to hers). We spend the whole night talking and such about how we’ve liked each other for a while. She also says she’s been telling other people in the society that she liked me for a while. However she mentions of a guy that she has been talking to for a while- they’re just talking nothing official. (It’s important to note that I already knew about this). And how she doesn’t know how she feels about both me and this guy. She is also going back home over the summer and she lives very far, and neither me nor this guy would be able to visit her. She mentions this to me, and I say let’s talk over the summer and try to get to know each other. She mentions that to me and say it could be a difficulty- but she doesn’t mention the other guy she is dating and how it would also be difficult for him. Bare in mind this guy lives nearby to me, so it would also be a struggle for him. She also keeps telling me I’m very handsome and that I could date anyone in the society, and asking why I like her out of everyone there. Anyway we say goodbye and leave for the night. A couple days later again by chance I’m out and she is too. So we hook up again. I had been messaging her if she’d like to go on a date a day beforehand which she said she may not have time but she’d let me know if she did. So I ask her if she knows when she is free throughout the night as she hadn’t mentioned it since but she either changes the topic of just doesn’t reply every time i ask. After sitting with her and kissing her for a while I ask if I can go back to hers . She says no I worry and ask if I overstepped. She says no she’ll explain later. So we go out and she gives the explanation: “my opinion is too high of you to bring you back” and then proceeds to say (somewhat believably) “if I didn’t care about you I’d defo bring you back “. I obviously accept, although a little jealous because a friend of hers had told me she had brought the other guy back. I tell myself maybe she doesn’t want sex to be the last time she sees me. But looking back on it I just think she was making excuses up. My mates gf also said to be careful because she might be playing me. I was also a little confused by this as she had left her housemates to be with me (on the last night they were spending together as a house). I asked if she still wanted to go on a date after a couple days of not messaging her as I hadn’t actually gotten a clear response from her she hasn’t responded when I asked her in person. She hasn’t responded yet but it hasn’t been very long. She also never really spoke to me when she was sobre just on nights out as a society. Do you think she was just using me? Any advice? Because I like her very much and this has hurt me a little.",dating

2937,Here it goes,So I’m a 22 year old male. I’ve never had a girl friend or even had a girl genuinely like me. Been on one bumble date. She made it sound like she was doing me a favor. She was cool but she cut it off. It hurt not going to lie. I workout 3 times a week. I have a stable job. I’m easy to talk to and I’m easy going. I don’t find it hard to talk to girls and my job requires me to be able to converse with men and women. A lot of the older women I’ve worked with find it “hard” to believe that I’m single. I know people will say it takes time to try and cheer me up but. I’m honestly starting to think that it’s never going to happen. I’ve tried to date girls that acted like they were interested in the begging just to turn around and act like I was the one who thought I liked them. At this point I don’t know if I’m attractive to women. I would love some help to better my dating outcomes.

2939,Male behaviours my female friend liked. Why is this the case?,"So me \[22 male\] and my friend \[22 female\] were discussing what behaviours are liked by girls. She offered to let me know about each of the guys that have been interested in her, and me and her sat down and analyzed common behaviours between the groups of guys she liked.

  
And I would really appreciate you all please provide an explanation as to why this is the case. I will obviously try my best to provide my opinion too. And she never specifically looked for these behaviours, it's just that when me and her sat down and analyzed it, we realized these behaviours. So the opposite of these behaviours is what she did not like in guys.  
**Behaviours in guys she liked:**

  
1. Not boyfriend / husband material.  
These were guys who were ""cycling"" between girls and never committed to one girl. The main goal for these guys would be to have sex  


2. Little to no hope of dating.  
These guys would be down to meet up frequently and do all of the stuff of a relationship, but they never gave any verbal confirmation that they want to keep things exclusive or want a relationship. These guys gave the vibe that they will leave the girl anytime without being attached to her.  


3. Showed sexual interest early on.  
These guys wouldn't shy away from expressing the fact that they are sexually attracted to the girl and would like to also have sex with her. Even if the conversation is the opposite from sex, eventually there would be a hint that he is interested in having sex with the girl  


4. Had her question whether he is emotionally interested.  
These guys would sometimes ignore her for an entire day or take a few hours to respond at times. They would definitely have full text conversations too, and they would be their best self in person, but after meeting up in person they wouldn't message her. She would have to message them first. Basically, she could never predict if he liked her, and would wonder if she messed up   


5. Guys who made her compete with other girls  
These guys would mention other girls and give no indication that they will leave the other girl. This would make my friend ""fight"" for these guys because she felt insecure that he could leave her for the other girl.  


6. Mystery  
These guys would never tell what they are up to, and wouldn't accept every plan by the girl to meet up. Sometimes they would decline the girl's plans because they were busy.   


7. Follower counts  
She said she subconsciously only attracted to the guys who had less than 200 followers, or more than 5000. She said people who have between 200 and 5000 followers seem as if they are collecting followers for the sake of it. She said a guy with less than 200 is attractive because it shows her he doesn't care about social media. And that a guy with more than 5000 is attractive because of social proof  


8. Guys who didn't walk on eggshells  
These guys would call her at any time of the day without care, and say the truth. They didn't insult her, but they wouldn't be afraid of saying what they truly think about her or the world  
For each of these, or just in general, what do you all think? Thank you!",dating
2940,"Deleted Dating Apps (Hinge, Bumble, Raya, Etc)","Deleted Hinge and Bumble (3rd time this year)

Like a lot of members in this community, I finally decided that OLD was consuming too much of my time. It’s almost like a second ex after a recent break up. 

There was a void in my life that I was looking to fill and half assed chit chats here and there just got tiring for me. After looking at my screen time usage for these apps, it was icing on the cake for me. I was beyond baffled at the time I was wasting. That time spent should’ve been applied to the real world. Time I should’ve spent networking with people in my industry and focusing on myself instead.

Speaking from personal experiences and my own perspective. I’d strongly urge everyone to identify your personal goals, and be cognizant with what you want in life before resorting to OLD right after something happens to you. 

It’s important that we all know our own life values and purpose. I have rather decent success on the apps but that time wasted for casual dates or hookups didn’t really benefit me in any way. I’m open to diving deeper in conversation and would love everyone’s thoughts.",dating

2942,is online dating even worth it?,"made a post earlier about how matches expire on bumble. people chimed in with different experiences. main takeaway for me is that girls get literally dozens and dozens of matches/messages from guys and they forget to reply, or get too busy, which is understandable. so if I'm not in the top 10% in terms of attractiveness (which I'm not), there's almost no chance of starting a conversation. this is why is bothers me when girls say 'just shoot your shot'.  like, I'd love to but there's 100 other guys shooting their shot and at some point it just feels like I'm on the voice and no one is spinning their chair around for me. I guess I'm going to have to join a bunch of clubs or something to try and meet people, idk",dating
2943,(29M) Feeling stuck with my dating life,"I'm 29 years old, I'm feeling a lot of struggles with my dating life and I would like to share some stories and get advice or perspectives.

The first relationship I've had was with a ""nerdy"" girl, who was very stable and very busy. We used to date in eating out, watching Netflix. I did motivate her to do more healthy activities together like running or having deep conversations. But she was way too busy, and her family was very religious. Eventually we broke up because I felt like we didn't spend enough time together.  


**The ex rant**  
The most recent one, has been the opposite of the first, the girl was an adventure spiritual hippie girl. Who had all the time in the world with almost no commitments, so long there was something to do she would be on board. Having almost no obligations, and me not having healthy boundaries with my finance and desparate need of connection, we went to so many different adventures together.

She would complain a lot about not feeling safe. Basically when she needed reassurance I would feel needed space. I would tell her I'm doing my best dealing with my own distress and also trying to support her. I told her many times that she has a lot of expectations which I'm not meeting, so why does she continue date me? 

At one point I noticed a pattern that I couldn't deal with. She would propose things as acts of kindness like ""Let's go on a 5 day vacation in Eilat"", when my response would be ""Listen, I can't because I have important projects at work, and I can't take that long vacation and meet my commitments"" Her response would be to take offense, and also throw tantrums and accuse me of not appreciating her.

**Fights, demands, breakup**  
Long story short, we had a couple of bad fights, we couldn't even talk. I would sit quiet and listen to her rants, and when I would start to talk I would be interrupted and not get any space to say anything.    
She would get angry a lot, and I couldn't deal with all the anger, and at one point it escalated so badly she threatened me and I tried to remove her from my apartment, this continued to her calling the police saying I'm attacking her (??).

The moment she called the police, I realized oh shit. And I moved away told her I'm sorry, and I didn't really harm her I just put my hands on her and she shouted and I moved away. Anyway, it was too late to tell the cops to go away, and this went on to the police arresting me and taking me and her to the police station.

It was terrible night, I tried to use the whole time to meditate and be patient. She told me she doesn't want to press charges and she didn't even want to go there, but the police insisted. I told them what happened eventually got released.

After the whole thing she came back to my place, we talked about everything that happened. She told me she doesn't want to break up - she wants to take a break and space and to think things through and talk about it later.

So we stopped talking, I would interact with her by watching her instagram stories and see what's she being up to. Lots of vacation, lots of meeting people, partying, and even a heartfelt post for her amazing friend that made me incredibly jealous.

During this time I felt amazing relief from not having her around. She was very demanding and pushing. I couldn't have space and time for myself, every ""No"" I given was an invitation to practice her persuasion skills.

Once her travel vacation finished, she came back from the vacation city. She gave me a call. The call started with a demand. ""Hey I'm back, I tried asking my friends but nobody could help so this is why I'm asking you, I ran out of weed and give me weed""

I felt violated that she would dare to call me just to make demands, and when we are on break and she goes out partying, and not having any deep conversation.

I tried to arrange that, but when logistical issues hit, I kept asking myself ""why would I do comply?"" I tried changing things up, like instead of delivering directly to her, delivering to myself and giving her a part instead of the whole thing. She didn't like that. Eventually I broke the deal and she hung up on me ""No problem""

After sometime it escalated more. She had an ear infection, went to a hospital. She texted me saying she's in a hospital. Not asking me to come visit, just making demands. She asked me to give her money because her moms' credit card didn't pass.

When I told her ""Listen, I'm not available right now I can't do this, can we talk about it tomorrow?"" Her response was ""Ok, I already know my stance, let's break up"" and I was ""Oh wow, she going to break up with my because I'm not available to give her money""?

I felt like it was better to starve for connection than to lose my dignity over such demands which I didn't feel were justified. Yeah, I have been generous, but I didn't realize that I would have to be 100% ""yes"" to every thing she demands, or else I'm losing the relationship.

Then she started making more demands like she wants to come to my house to take the stuff she left while staying over, saying she wants to come with her mom. I told her I'll give everything she wants without her entering. She threatened with police.

Eventually I wrote her that she doesn't have much and police would just be more annoying than helpful to both of us, so I suggested to pack everything she has and deliver it to her place, and she agreed and that was the last conversation we had.

So it has been a couple of months since. This whole time I'm filled with sadness about how things ended, and how wonderful of experiences we shared and what a shame that it didn't work out. Trying to come up with solutions like making the relationship more light, and just spend time together as friends rather than be romantic partners who fight all the time.

I deleted her account from my WhatsApp and instagram and Facebook. But I kept checking in on her public profile pictures and still do to this day! Crying because she's not there, crying because I have no one else, wanting a closure, a ""let's leave as friends"" conversation..Feeling desparate.

Even though I miss her a lot. But I don't follow through, I check her contact on WhatsApp and think of writing a message, but I don't follow through because I know I'm in a desparate place and I feel like I would end up in the same place..

**Moving on**  
I'm struggling with going on dates. The past relationship came after 3 years of tinder swiping and going to workshops. The one before that also was like a long 4-5 year period. Now I'm terrified that the next girl would be in 5 years or so.

I'm using Tinder a lot. I'm spending lots of money on super likes and boost and all that stuff, but I get almost no matches, and even less conversations, and no dates at all.

I'm trying to go on workshops like art workshops, or spiritual retreats and tech meetups. But there I'm very shy in person and struggling with approaching girls and hitting on them.

I feel like I'm in a not so beneficial mindset regarding dating. It's like, when I'm at home and have nothing to do I'm thinking ""Why not go spend time with people, maybe meet someone"" then when I'm at the different venue its ""why bother, it's not going to work, even if it does it'll end up badly""

Then I'm like stuck in this ""Alone sucks, but relationships suck more"" and when I go from being alone to seeking relationship I feel like I'm going to the place of chasing and giving boundaries up and changing my lonely personality to fake-social personality""

Other philosophies state that to find a relationship - stop looking for it - which makes me feel like yeah, attractive people don't just go and chase people, they attract them. But on the other hand, that feels like I'm avoiding the challenge of opening up.

I thought of going to those social seminars like RSD or other pick up courses. But they are damn expensive - probably less expensive than the vacations I bought for this one girl..

Anyway I'm not sure what to do. I want an amazing relationship. I want compatible one. I want one that has it's ups and downs where the trend is of up. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I don't know what I can do better. 

Feeling lost and overwhelemed with all the different philosophies about relationships, at the same time suffering from my tears of loneliness. Afraid to make connection from a place of desparity, but also afraid of being stuck alone.

2944,Why do people continue a conversation to just ghost it?,"I get ghosting before a first date or if it hasn’t been that long of a time. I get things kind of fizzling out but it’s also kind of seemed to me that you can see that coming. 

But I what don’t get is when people will respond to a lukewarm/neutral message that isn’t asking anything in particular with a semi-detailed response and follow up with a question only to never respond again. 

What gives?",dating
2945,General dating tip: know your target demographic,"I am a late 20s heterosexual male so I can only speak from this perspective, however I believe this can apply to anyone.

Nobody wants to look at dating as marketing/sales but that essentially is what it boils down to. If your company produces an amazing product, but they only market to people who aren't interested in it, they won't have much success, or maybe will think something is wrong with their product.

The same goes for dating. When I was younger, I would have the attitude of ""I can get any girl because I'm so confident"" and I would put pressure on myself to try and get girls that I thought were hot, but were not compatible for whatever reason. 

I am mixed race and live in the midwest, so my dating experiences have been a mixed bag. Over the years I have found the overlap of the types of girls that I like that also like me. I have learned that the least compatible type for me would be white country/conservative girls. Yes, some of them are very hot, but they often have unhinged political views and expectations, and they exclusively want white men with trucks. 

And guess what, that's totally okay because I am not attracted to them either, and not everyone is everyone's cup of tea. 

I then began to notice similarities of girls that I did have success with: educated, non-white, or white (but liberal and/or artsy), introverted, usually a grad student or med student at the university in my city. They also tend to have some interest in my culture. 

For women, since you are the ones choosing from a line of suitors, if you are not liking the types of men approaching you, consider the type of woman that the man you want would want. What is she like? What does she wear? Where does she hang out at? Once you are able to cater to the audience you want, you will have the type of men you want approaching you.

2946,We hung out and then she texted me the next day on switch up shit,Lots of fun hanging out super chill dosent seem weird in hindsight or anything plenty of goodmorning texts and then around afternoon she switched up and wrote me paragraphs and I fed into it and regret doing so I wish I ignored her. Everything I said to her was the wrong thing to say and she was inconsolable or would say things that contradict a statement prior and I couldn’t see a point in her words. Made me feel like shit cuz I could not figure out what I did and I don’t think I did anything or it was my fault. She was mad trippin ab just bullshit. It dosent make sense how evything was fine and then it wasn’t. Nothing I said was good or right to her.

2947,What can you do when the girl you’ve been dating starts to lose interest?,"We have been talking for 8 months and lately she seems to be to busy to find time for us and texts me a lot less.

We have been talking too much, I flirted with her and she also responded back nicely. She said I'm a good man, and rated me 9/10. But she doesn't like making it official. She has some myths and negative images in her mind about being in a relationship. She thought she wouldn't be able to live freely or do shit what she wants to do. I don't know how to help her, and how to proceed. It's been more than 3 years since we are in touch and now I finally confessed my feelings, I fucking love her she is great, and I also treat her in a best way possible. I don't want to give up easily what should I do.",dating
2949,He ghosted me,"Around three months ago this guy (33M) and I (25F) had met and hit it off real quick. We lived an hour from each other and had different schedules but we made it work. We quickly decided we were only going to see each other exclusively. He seemed real honest and genuine. He really liked me (so he said) and vice versa.

Due to both of us having scheduling issues we hadn’t seen each other in a month. Everything seemed fine though; we talked and texted everyday. His mother is sick though and a week ago he cancelled coming to see me because he took her to the hospital (understandable). This week he said he was on his way and was close. We talked on the phone about how excited we were to see each other and everything was normal…he even picked up the phone with “hey love”…but then he deleted/blocked me on everything and never showed up obviously.

How do I move past this? It feels like a slap in the face. I’m obviously a little sad to have lost this person but I’m more upset about the way it happened, the trust that was broken, and the fact I’ll never know why he did what he did when there was no indication of anything. I’ve had this exact scenario happen before (a guy told me his mom died and then immediately deleted me off everything) and him and I talked about it and he said he’d never do that to me…

If his mother was critical or dying I can see maybe he shut down and didn’t want to talk about it. But that also means he took the extra step to block me on three different things…",dating

2951,Has a Situationship ever turned out something later in life?,"Sometimes situationships come up, when people get along very well but are not ready to enter a relationship for various reasons. It can be Timing, Work, not knowing where life goes etc that prevents people to commit to another person. This is very understandable and I think many people had phases in their life where they just didn't want to commit to anything and keep life open. If you don't have a somewhat clear vision of where you wanna go it is hard to include someone else in the journey. Situationships are not forever mostly so sooner or later they break apart.

I asked myself if it happend that you meet the same person later in life and with other circumstances and look back to the situationship: Has it ever truned to a relationship later because of compatibility, and it was the right moment?",dating

2955,How to understand if somebody cheated?,Just for future reference if you ask your boyfriend if they cheated on you and then they block you on WhatsApp what do you think that means? Like in my opinion the only reason they would do that is if they are so scared of the confrontation that they are trying not to have it which is basically like ad admission of guilt. The other option is that they don't want to be with me anymore but that would just confirm they'd been lying to me and would confirm this anyway. Either option it seems to me like this kind of reaction (silence and avoidance) is like admitting to it already or at least confirming that it happened. What do you think?,dating

But, however, I realized how creepy it was to post my holiday fling on my story. He had a habit of listing out all his favourite qualities about me every time we went out and I thought it was really sweet. I never did it back because I was just taken aback and went mute in awe. 

So I posted all the little things that I liked about him on my Instagram story as a goodbye letter, in his way. 

My guy friends said it was creepy, so I agree now and am kinda mortified.

2958,Opinions on texting her after a week of no contact…,"We’ve been seeing each-other for about two and a half months.
We only text maybe a couple times a week. I put more energy into messaging her than she does me. I try to be playful but I’ve been told I come across as corny. The texts often feel friendly more than romantic from her. She has never sent me a “miss you” or flirty text. 
She has told me it takes her awhile to warm up to someone. I just don’t know. It has been two and a half months and I’ve never quite experienced this kind of “sparse” communication with someone while dating in the past. I have to say that I am feeling unfulfilled, but I’m also trying to mirror or match enthusiasm. I really do like her and when we’re together it has been nice. 

The last time we messaged was Monday…I’m thinking of send her a “miss your face” type text tomorrow…. I don’t know why I’m posting this other than to request some opinion or thoughts on this…",dating

2965,Am I wrong for feeling this way? She was my first love even though we never dated.,"I (23m) am struggling to get over a girl I never dated. We both went to highschool together for 3 out of the 4 years in our small town. We clicked instantly! It started out as just passing by each other in the halls but then slowly moved to hanging out in the mornings. A summer goes by and as the new year started she and I rode the same bus to and from school. We talked everyday about anything and everything. It was effortless! We shared so much in common. We had the same humor, same interests, same goals… It felt like it was just us two in the world. She was the only girl I was interested in. We grew a bond that was extremely special to me, it felt like we were inseparable I’ll never forget her. I can’t express the way she made me feel. As the years of school dragged on and graduation got closer I figured I should probably make a move. As her out, ask her to prom, ask her something! Anything! I asked my friends daily for advice and motivation to make a move but every time the opportunity arose, I chickened out. Idk why I did, I deeply regret it now but at the time I just pushed it off. As senior year came closer and closer to an end, I noticed something…..My best friend who I trusted with my life and one who I told everything to, was always active at the same time as she was. At first I chalked it up as a coincidence but the pattern continued for weeks. I couldn’t see any demeanor changes when we all hung out so I just told myself I was being paranoid. But something didn’t feel right and I grew extremely jealous but hid it under a smile. I never mentioned it. One Monday morning my crush comes up to me at the bus stop and tells me all about her weekend and how she went out with my best-friend. She was ecstatic. The joy was beaming off her and I was crushed. I felt such an overwhelming cloud of sadness and betrayal. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My best-friend, my brother who I would do everything for and the one who knew most about my feelings for her, had swooped in. He never told me about their weekend together. I was distraught, angry sad and confused. I was broken. A week goes by and eventually he told me. He apologized and said it was nothing and he would never do anything to ruin the relationship between me and her but the damage was done. She was no longer interested in me, she was only after him. I lost her to my best-friend. He knew she was my world and that I was struggling to express my feelings towards her so I felt so lost and betrayed when I heard about them. We stopped being friends after that. I couldn’t trust him anymore. By the time graduation came around they weren’t talking much but we’re still friends. She was sort of interested in me again but it was too late. We went our separate ways. I miss her so much. She was my first love even though we never dated. I know it sounds weird but I truly can’t express what type of feelings I had for her. I need advice Reddit. Idk what to do. It’s been 5years and I still think about her daily. She’s not even in the same state as me anymore. I’ve been with girls since but it’s not the same. This has ruined me and I’m broken. What should I do? Am I right for the way I felt?",dating

Today, I was managing a completely different location and I bumped into her again today. 

She did a double take and smiled at me, but in a super friendly way, not flirting but kinda like she recognized me but wasn’t sure from where. Again, she asked me something and I helped her out. 

Haven’t been able to stop thinking about her and found her on socials. 0 mutuals. Should I shoot her a request? She’s super lowkey but I was still able to find her. Don’t wanna creep her out lol

I liked the look of this guy and I felt like we were maybe interested in each other so I gave him my Instagram and he never got back to me. This guy at my college was giving me vibes and I fancy him so I messaged him on Instagram and he never replied. I slept with this guy I really fancied and left my number and he never got back to me- even though he comes into the bar where I work and looks at me with feelings.

What's weird is often these guys seem to have feelings, they're showing signs they like me, but they never message back. It's just exhausting. Why not? It's making me feel like I'm just unlovable. Especially how they'll get a different girlfriend.

it’s even creepier because sometimes they don’t even know me for long so i almost feel like a fetish to them. as if they like the idea of me or are just extremely infatuated with me mainly because of my looks.
a male friend of mine described it to me by saying that i was “like the sun”, and that i just give off some kind of strong pull or warm aura apart from how i look.

2975,Advice! Worried I’ll never find a relationship/ or go on a first date. Is it too late to try?,"I (22f) have always been fat. I struggle with PCOS and hormonal weight gain. I am at my heaviest which is around 370lb. I exercise and eat moderately healthy, yet I can’t lose weight due to my hormones.I am dealing with trauma from fat-phobia, both internalized and external (parents, peers, social media). I am a huge advocate for body acceptance, and I believe that morality is not linked to weight or appearance. Unfortunately, I have a problem applying this personal philosophy to myself. Growing up all of my friends met boys and girls and had relationships. Even now, I’m the only friend that is single with zero romantic experience or otherwise. I’ve never had that. I’ve never had anyone approach me in real life to ask me on a date or tell me they have a crush on me or anything like that. I do get a lot of DMs on dating apps but I’m afraid to meet in person as they might  realize/ think  Im bigger in person than they thought through the phone screen, or just not want anything to do with me because I’m not skinny.  I spend so much of my time worrying and judging myself for having no experience at my age and it’s exhausting. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve talked to a therapist but it doesn’t seem to help with this issue. 

I am ashamed and embarrassed and really scared that I will never meet someone who will love me and think I’m beautiful. I want to stop thinking this way  or maybe just try and do other things with my time other than worrying that I’ll be alone and sad forever.

2976,Girls only “fall” for me in person,"I got my first girlfriend when I was 20. She was my best friend’s GF’s best friend and we hit it off at a party then I hit her up to chat, worked out well.


In retrospect in high school and university there were a few girls that were into me but I had very low self esteem and couldn’t really see it. One even took away my phone, entered her number and gave it back to me and I didn’t pick up on it… yes, I know.


I started working and I’ve sorted out my self esteem. 2 out of 3 female colleagues were constantly flirting with me and wanted to hang out with me (1on1). At my next job 1 colleague kissed me and told me she has had a crush on me for months. We started dating and we fell for each other, but it ended. Another job, another girl fell for me even though she had a BF…


I don’t look good, I’m average. Everyone says I have a good sense of humour and I can cheer up a room so probably my charm really comes online in person and after I become a bit more comfortable. If I look at it roughly and I consider the girls I’ve been in close contact with, around 60% of them wanted something from me.


Online dating? I can barely get a match or two a month. My profile could be better I agree on that but I hate taking photos and as I’ve said I’m not that good looking. I’d call myself a 6 at best with a fresh haircut and with my best clothes.


I don’t know what to do. All my friends don’t have female friends as they’re all IT guys, they only have their SOs. I’ve been working from home for 3 years now and I’m in a really small company anyway without any female colleagues. I don’t have the balls to go up to girls on the streets or at bars. I barely go out because I don’t enjoy it.

2977,Can’t tell if this is a shot at trying again or not.,"In a weird spot and have no clue what I’m doing. Had been seeing a gal for a couple months, we went on a trip together. Didn’t turn out how we expected, looking back it was a stupid idea we just weren’t ready. While on that trip her grandfather went into hospice and she was also kinda doubting if she wanted to stay in the area which didn’t help things.

She dumped me when we got back, saying she didn’t think we were as good a match as we thought. She said we should stay friends but never acted on it. That was 2 months ago.

Texted her the other day asking if she wanted some stuff from my garden since I have way too much. Surprisingly she texted me back like 5min later. Came over the next day after work and we ended up talking for 3 hours. We caught up and talked through what happened a bit.

Now I’m like what do I do now. Key points, she said she missed spending time together, that she had been thinking of me and she had thought about reaching out a couple times but chickened out. Let me know it wasn’t all on me and that she should have better communicated what she needed, but really appreciated that I was there for her on the trip. 

I said I thought that it was something we needed to have talked about but not worthy of a break up. That I wished we had taken a break let her get things in order and then figured things out from a better place. She agreed that would have been better but hadn’t wanted me to think she had wanted to see other people. She has a new job that’s less stressful and renewed her lease so she’s going to be around for awhile. 

When she left I said don’t be afraid to text me, her response was basically the same thing back, which gives me pause unless it’s a I’ve said enough balls in your court dude.


Am I crazy to think she’s giving me an opportunity to try again? Like do I just try to make small talk and see. Or take it deeper and tell her I’ve missed her too, ask her on a “second first date” of sorts?
I’m just kinda clueless so appreciate any advise.",dating
2978,"Are there any ways to meet women outside of dating apps? Or any lesser known dating apps besides bumble, tinder, hinge?","What dating apps or things would you recommend to meet women? My facebook dating account recently stopped working. I actually started liking Facebook dating because with tinder or bumble, I would get maybe 1 match month. But, I'd get like 30 to 40 with Facebook dating. So idk what the deal is with all those swiping sites? However, even with facebook dating, a lot of women would only send 1 or 2 messages then stop talking. 

Seems like no one can hold a conversation anymore. Pof used to be good too, but now it's overrun with bots and you can only message 1 person a day. OKcupid went downhill in 2018 when they tried to copy tinder, and now there's hardly anyone on there. It also seems like there's no one in your area on the apps too, and everyone's 2 to 3 hours or more away. 

Other people say meet people in person. But, I'm like how? Most women only hang out with other groups of women that they know. I don't like Bars and clubs cause I don't drink. That's the same deal too where people hang out only in friend groups that they've known for a long time. People say the library too, but idk of anyone that even goes to libraries anymore.
Meetup doesn't have any events unless your in one of the 3 biggest major cities in the US. 

So, it's almost like your forced to use the apps to meet women. I have noticed with online dating though that people are hella flakely. Even if you do meet them, they only meet for 1 or 2 times then never see you again. 

Any other advice for apps or things to do to meet women? It's so hard because a lot of women hang out in groups of bfs they've had for life. So, with the whole day game stuff, even if you say hi to a woman, it won't go past the hey how's the weather type talk. If it even goes that far, because how will you just strike up a conversation with a woman walking by you, or if they have their headphones on in the gym, or at the grocery store?",dating

All of my friends (and everyone I know for that matter. Siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles) has had relationships and they travel out, have fun, etc. and then there’s me who can’t even get a friend to hang out with because every single one of them either complains or bails last minute. So to go places to meet people, I can’t even do that, because I have no one to go with cause I don’t wanna go alone.

On top of that, I’ve been on dating apps for SIX YEARS, and never have I had one match. It’s just depressing and I’m missing out on my youth. The most frustrating part is that it is so much easier for everybody else. What can I do to fix this issue? Thank you for listening!",dating

I personally don't think I am an artist by any stretch of the word, however, I do know that art is so, so broad, so maybe someone out there thinks I'm a Picasso lol. Anyways, despite my feelings about my own work, I truly love painting. It calms me down and keeps me busy for an entire day or 2, as that's usually how long my paintings take. I like to put a lot of detail in them, and it takes me longer than most to get the painting to look how I want it. Overall, painting brings me a lot of joy. My question is this: if someone gave you a handmade painting as a ""just because"" gift, would you think it was silly, or is that a sweet idea? I'd never give my paintings away to a friend or SO in leu of a Christmas gift or something, but I thought a just cause gift would be kind and cute. However, I don't wanna be dorky or give a friend or SO something they can't use and are stuck with out of obligation lol so I'd just like y'alls input on how you'd feel if this situation happened to you.

I haven't dated in such a long time that I'm having difficulty with the ""casual"" nature of most dating interactions. My level of care and consideration for another person is still at the ""partner"" level and I'm not sure how to best scale things back. For example, there was someone I was interested in, he mentioned he really liked to cook and his favorite dishes to make were pasta dishes, so I suggested we pick up the appropriate equipment from the Bed Bath & Beyond liquidation sale and see how much of a difference there is between fresh and boxed pasta. Too much, right? I don't want to keep getting it wrong with people I genuinely like. Any advice here?",dating

We do not, directly, work together. 

However we popped cameras on, a first, and were talking. Turns out we're from the same area and we have a laugh about how it was there.

I drop about being single and she gives it the 'aww I'm so sorry etc"" but then goes with the ""you're an attractive man I'm sure you'll be fine"". Honestly just a compliment as a guy is great, but she's saying that in her office happy as Larry!

She then invites me out to work drinks with her and her friends, apparently a leaving drink, over near her work.

Have I accidentally been flirting? She's an attractive woman, honestly very attractive, and this is a heck of a suprise to me! Especially as my confidence has been fairly low since my previous relationship.

2988,Seeking Guidance: How to Put Dating Advice into Practice?,"After spending some time trying the art of dating, following various instructors, and reading several books, it all boils down to one common theme: behavior. Being confident, assertive, having goals, and displaying masculinity are the key elements emphasized by all instructors and books.  
  
However, one thing I've noticed, which I consider to be even more important than those factors, is what I would call intuition. When I converse with men who are successful in dating, who effortlessly attract one person after another, I observe that they possess a sharp radar that analyzes the overall context. They consistently make the right decisions at the right time and in the right way with each specific person. To achieve this, a significant mental power is required.  
  
For example, while simultaneously considering logistical details like ""How will I plan the date?"" they are also pondering, ""Is this conversation engaging?"" ""What should I say next to create a connection?"" ""What type of person am I dealing with?"" ""What is the energy level of this person?"" All of this is happening in their subconscious, and within that, they have microseconds to make the best decision in the moment! Unfortunately, some people, like myself, were not naturally blessed with this incredible ability.  
  
No matter how many videos I watch or books I read on the subject, none of them will teach me how to handle these micro-decisions. Success depends on your performance in the moment. This is why many people say that, ultimately, you have to put it into practice, regardless of your level of knowledge. 

You may have read all the books and watched various instructors, but when you are in that exact moment, everything depends on your ability to make good decisions in a matter of microseconds! Ultimately, nobody can teach you that skill, which is the most crucial one: using your brain to align all external conditions, merge them with your goals, and externalize them in the best decisions of the moment!  
  
That's why people emphasize going out and practicing so much. It's true. In the end, even if you are a complete newbie who hasn't studied or taken any dating courses, if you start practicing, you may perform better than those who remained stuck in their heads! 

Do you agree? If so what can I do to ""practice dating""?",dating

2994,Looking back asking my friend out was a dumb idea,"Some context:

lets call my friend lily. Last month I broke up with my ex since I didn't see myself with her long-term. On the day I broke up with my girlfriend (now ex). Now on the day I broke up with my girlfriend, Lily knew I was going to break up with my girlfriend that day. coincidentally Lily calls me right after I broke up. She could hear i was sad and i told her i had literally broke up with my girlfriend couple min before she called me. It was definitely hard for me to breakup with my girlfriend since i really liked her but i just didn't see myself long-term with her. Lily could hear that I was sad and wanted to cheer me up and asked me if i wanted to get dinner

Now what makes this even more dumb is that I Lily broke up not too long ago too and I knew lily still lives with her ex because they have a lease still

Lily was telling me how she thinks dating someone would help her move on faster but she told me she wouldn't be able to find anyone that will be willing to date her in her situation. In the end i just told her i like her and asked her if she wanted to date me and happily agreed. Now after some time she realize that how shit it would be if we dated since of her current situation. In the end we did not date. I was the only one who thought it would work out

looking back i was really emotional and vulnerable that day when I asked lily if she wanted to date. That day was the same day i broke up with ex and i think since Lily was there for me i ended up being attached to her

it's been a month since I asked Lily out and now that I am thinking rationally i realize how dumb it was. Just the idea of dating someone who still lives with their ex is so dumb and i cringe at myself. I can't believe at one point i thought dating lily would work",dating

2998,My (18M) labeling issues causing problems with (18F),"I’ve been seeing this person since January of last year. The circumstances are complicated and irrelevant, but suffice it to say she made it clear that she wasn’t comfortable with us using the label of “dating”, and I was alright with that. To me labels like that don’t really matter as long as we’re both on the same page with what we expect from one another. 

Now my family is very conservative, so to make our situationship more palatable for them I submitted to their assertions that we were, in fact, dating and not just friends. I let her know this at the time and she was alright with it, albeit a little bit uncomfortable.

Things were fine and this wasn’t mentioned until she wanted to introduce me to one of her friends. Things were going nicely until they asked if we were dating. Now because she was fine with me saying we were dating to my family for simplicity’s sake, I said yes. She responded with no and I deferred to her because if she wants to explain, she can. After a brief explanation we moved on as if nothing had occurred. We talked afterwards to make sure we were on the same page about what we were, and moved on. 

Last Friday I was hanging out with a mutual friend of ours and he asks if we’re dating. I didn’t think much of it, and because I didn’t want to explain I said yes. Now her school offers chaperoned trips every so often, so her and this friend (along with some others I don’t know) left for Germany a few days ago. Sometime during their first day there, the friend texts me and brings up that she says we aren’t dating. I responded that it was all just semantics to me and that whatever she said was likely more accurate. She called me later that day so we could be clear on the topic and she sounded (reasonably) upset. I understand that telling him we were dating could have overstepped a boundary and, because I was in a hurry at the time, asked if we could talk about it later. She said yes and we hung up. About an hour later, at 11:00 (Germany time) she texts me and says that I should tell everyone we broke up. I said it would probably be a bad idea to say anything until we’re both on the same page and she didn’t respond. 

It really bugged me because I hate to see her mad or uncomfortable and I ended up talking to the friend she was in Germany with about it today. He mentioned that she said she was considering going full no contact and that she was really mad at me. I still haven’t gotten a response directly from her but I haven’t pushed at all because I don’t want to look desperate.

She’s never really been one to jump to conclusions about things like this and I never got the vibe that she wanted to end our relationship or even that she was this upset with me when we called. I really want to make things right but I think she’s really overreacting to the situation. I didn’t think I was doing something wrong at the time and I just want to work it out with her.

3004,Did I mess up?,"TW // reference to SH

A lady (20) came into my (M22) job and we sparked up some conversation, and after a few days of talking back and forth about books and movies we liked, SHE asked ME for my number, the day I was going to ask her for hers (lol).

We have a first date of mini golfing and things are going super well. I quickly notice she's very introverted, and she's trying her best to be more social. It wasn't a surprise for me to find out (later that night) that I was the first date she's ever had. Her introverted nature naturally means she's a dry texter, which doesn't upset me, but I make sure to check in if there's no response after a few hours or so, since she expresses she tends to forget to reply sometimes. Everything went off without a hitch, and things were perfect, even into a couple days after the date. We plan to do pottery, suggesting we do it soon, Wednesday.

Fast forward to today, pottery day, and she says we need to reschedule, something came up. I tell her it's okay, no need to feel bad. As the day goes on, she's oddly distant, even for her. I assume she's busy, or just not in a mood to talk, so I gave her a few hours and hit her up again. More hours pass, and I start to worry, so I simply say ""hope everything is okay!"" And out of nowhere, a few minutes after, she tells me she's not sure she's interested in continuing things. 

Confused, I ask her why, and she tells me I'm great, but that I'm ""overwhelming"" her. It makes sense to me, I'm extroverted, she's introverted, but it also strikes me as off because she was very receptive and even appreciative for me double and triple texting before. I felt bad mainly because I'd wait so long to double text because I was scared of overwhelming her. She then tells me some recent things have been happening, being expressly vague. I tell her that I'd hate for things to end over something I can change right now, and ask her what's been going on if she'd be comfortable telling me.

//TW HERE//

She tells me she called off the pottery date because she didn't want me to see her self harm scars, and that she gets very depressed, anxious, and has obsessive thoughts of self harm. She then tells me how this all has been very new for her, and that she's worried things will go too quick.

3005,Asking if it's worth starting all over again.," I was married for 25 years, raised 3 kids (2 step sons and a daughter of my own blood with my wife). In 2019, on New Years Eve, I lost my wife to suffering battle of cancer. Then Covid hits, and the whole world basically shuts down in one way or the other. I was still grieving badly with no where really to go, no one to really understand my pain or the thoughts running around in my head because as a man I couldn't take that pain away from my wife, my soulmate!  Instead, I had to watch her life being sucked right out of her, her soul leave her body.  I was living in a deep black hole for a very long time. I had to drag myself out of bed just to go to work, which had just moved us from the midwest to the east coast about 2 years before so I really had no good friends to speak of, acquaintances, yes but not really a good friend, all of our family was back in the midwest. I had lost about 40 lbs (stress will do that, I found out the hard way). However, now, over time, I've climbed myself out of that black hole and now I'm faced with what I'm going to do now.  I miss the conversations, the laughter, the smiles I got when I walk in the door, the holding of hands and each other at night. I miss our love!

 Now I'm 56 and have no idea how to start all over again or even if it would be worth it. I know I'm not the type of person who wants to go on dating websites just to have some bot attack me over and over again or the web of lies that comes from all of that. So now I sit here wondering how will I ever find someone to share that love I know I have to give. Are there really true and honest women out there? Am I too old to find that happiness again. Do I really want to open my heart to that pain that will surely come again? Do I put myself out there or just let things happen as they happen in life. I'm in no rush, but life is truly short, and if I let it pass by.....it will !!!

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",dating
3006,GF(26) broke up with me (M30),"My gf and I of  5 years recently broke up but not broke up. We're kinda in limbo as she wanted to break up but after some heartfelt discussions we decided to just give each space and take it day by day. We  have had communication issues in the past. She's vented to me about going to therapy and couples therapy. For I have anger outbursts and have a hard time dealing with emotions and dealing with her anxiety. I was always hesitant as I've never done therapy or anything like that and it's scary for me. But with the recent circumstances I finally said I would be willing to try and we had a session today (6/14/23). It went well, it was first ever therapy session as a couple or individual and I'll say it definitely benefited me and how I view our current situation. That's what really convinced her to take it day by day.  

Quick backstory leading up to the event above, we had a serious discussion about breaking up and how we were both unhappy ect. About 2 weeks ago. It was probably the most honest and heartfelt Convo we had in a while. We discussed my therapy or lack of it and how it really affected her. And also my commitment level to her. Which is hard for me cause we've been in such idk a blah relationship the past year.  It's not like it's bad, we have awesome sex like really good lol, we have a good time together, do a lot of activities together ect ect.. but when she has anxiety or when we argue that's when it's bad. I guess the good is really good and the bad is really bad. We had similar discussions in the past but I never knew she felt so strongly about me going to therapy for my anger. If I had then maybe I would've persued it more. Or have made it into a priority. Not just for us for myself too.  Note; she's been going to individual therapy for about 3 years now. And I've definitely seen improvement with her anxiety and how she tries to handle it different. It was just so bad, anytime I'm not with her she would blow up my phone accuse me of cheating or doing drugs but it's not AS bad as it was. 
But by the end of the discussion we decided to really openly try and fix our relationship and I'll do the therapy. Granted it took me for her breaking up with me to make an appointment but I have pretty bad ADHD. 

Moving to present time (this week, it's like day 3 of going back n forth) I went away for the weekend to a couple of concerts, came back Sunday night (6/11).

So Monday morning I go fish, I fished for about 8 hours so it was a long day but in that time frame she decided to 1) change her password on her phone, 2) refused to kiss me 3) and actually  broke up with me. Now I'm hysterical because we just discussed how we were gonna work on things then I'm gone for the weekend and she lays that on me. She claims it was a lot of time to think and stuff and she was so set in stone. Come to find out she's been applying for jobs like 7 hours away(hometown)  from where we live and was  applying Sunday night! And now she has an interview for one of those jobs. But now after our therapy session she's like idk anymore it was good session. Cause that's all she ever really wanted, I just never knew how severe.  It's just really confusing cause she was so dead set on breaking up. And all I've been trying to do is convince her to take it day by day and to do the therapy together. But she's using the to little to late line which is understandable. I'm just so taken back cause we're having a good week before I left. 

The therapist suggested giving each other space which she wanted from the start. It just hard cause I had like no time to prepare myself so I rejected it but I know it's the right thing. It's not like I don't agree, I mean we're both not the happiest but we both love each other deeply. But our current living place is small, to small to give each other real space. But we also live in the middle of nowhere so our friends are kinda far lol she's the type of person who needs the space, but I'm the type that craves touch especially when Im hurting or I know we're both are. We are sleeping not in the same bed and she's saying at a friend's tomorrow.  

She says she needs the space but last time she had it she wanted to break up, hence why I'm so against it but I can't not respect it. I'm just scared cause her interview is Friday, and she's basically guaranteed the job. She told them her start date wouldn't be till 2nd week of August though, due to logistics of moving. And she doesn't know if she wants me to go with her or not. I know I've been fighting with her to try and save us and try the therapy (which she did) and the day by day take. Which she also did.  Like she's applying for jobs and buying totes to pack. I'm buying online therapy and been working on myself since the first discussion 2 weeks ago. She says she's exhausted from trying so long in our relationship. But honestly I think she's been trying more so for herself. 

Example she claimed she went to therapy and discussed how she would get super anxious if I wasn't home and instead of blowing my phone up she just wouldn't text me. But she claimed to do that to avoid fighting and arguing cause I was defensive and annoyed with what she was upset about or accusing me of. That's just an example of her "" exhausting herself for the relationship"" even though I don't think that statement is accurate. 

Sorry I'm gonna wrap this up lol. So what do I do what do we ? Idk I'm tired of typing though",dating
3007,Does she like me,So today as a school Trip we went to the movies me and my crush were sitting next to each other And we kept on looking at each other and laughing. Then she puts up the cup holder and I asked her what she’s doing she proceeded to say nothing. then our arms where touching each other. She then proceeds to put her head in my shoulder. and we are just looking into each other’s eyes.

I love meeting new people and I don’t struggle with having the confidence to ask them out, also a lot of my friends have called me a “conventionally attractive dude”. My problem is even if I like the person I’m on a date with, and have plenty to talk about with them, I just can’t seem to get a relationship started or go on a more serious date before they tell me “we’d be better as friends”. I got out of a pretty long term relationship (for me) about one year ago, and I just haven’t been able to create that same type of “spark” since.

It can be very overwhelming for me and it takes me some time to process. I’m honestly anxious to talk to him about it. And I’m not sure how I would start the conversation. 
About 6 months into dating, I gave him a cute, thoughtful letter basically telling him that I’m falling for him. I didn’t say that I was in love with him because I was afraid that it would be too soon. And i also just wanted to see how he was feeling but I didn’t get a full response because something came up. Could he be waiting on me to say something? But I’m also wonder why he hasn’t told me anything or why he could possibly be waiting on me?",dating

3013,Weird one,"Ok help me out here. I went on a date with a guy, thought things went seemingly well. We texted beforehand and clicked instantly. Later texts me that he wasn’t really feeling it and doesn’t want another date. Few weeks later, he wants to hook up/ no strings attached. So doesn’t want to date but wants to fuck lol.

3014,Telling people to move where their from is bad advice.,"Here me out, while yes it could change things it’s arguably the worst advice in this sub. I personally live in a rural area with almost nowhere to meet people so I understand why telling someone/ being told to move can be very beneficial for meeting someone/ people HOWEVER people fail to realize people can’t just move location outta the blue. 

Here’s a few reasons why.
   1. Housing market: Pretty much everyone knows the housing market sucks and everything is way overpriced. It has been proven that at least 50% or more can’t afford to move in America. Rent is too high, Interest rates are too high, etc. Not to mention someone may be in a lease they still have 6+ months on. 
   2. Job/ business: I’m gonna use myself as an example for this. I own my own business, and that business isn’t cheap. In order to move I’d need to pay to move that as well which includes finding a new space for that business. That’s without mentioning my business is made for where I currently live, if I were to move elsewhere then my business would likely fail pretty quickly. A lot of people are in that predicament or work a job where that can’t move without finding a brand new job.
   3. Just because someone can move doesn’t mean it’ll help them. With moving not only are you risking the first 2 things but also your friends, family, and possibly their overall lifestyle. (Using myself again) I personally live a more rural/ country lifestyle. I know for a fact I wouldn’t do well in a more city environment and there’s many others who are that way & vise versa. You may have a very hard time keeping in touch with friends and family that you’ll lose what you already had and if you don’t meet the type of person your after by moving then you did it all for nothing.

3017,Winning over a workaholic?🤦‍♀️,"(F21) I’ve been seeing this guy (M23) on and off since February. Well I don’t see him that often and when i do we’re mostly hooking up and in general acting like a couple. He’s not a big texter either so he mostly just calls once in a while just to talk or meet up. At first we saw each other and talked on the phone frequently which seemed promising but it has died down. He has a busy life he works as a captain on smaller yachts and he has another job so it’s understandable that he doesn’t have alot of time on his hands but this situation is bothering me because i actually do like him. He seems to like me too everytime we’re in contact or see each other. He seems to be fine with this situation but its not enough for me. I tried telling him last time we met up which was a few days ago, he wanted to show me the new yacht he’s working on and of course his excuse to my words was that he’s trying to build a career and save up money which results in him not having much of a social or personal life anymore. On the one hand I understand on the other i just keep thinking that if he wanted to he would. He could at least communicate more. I know most of you will say to let it go and move on but I’m just wondering if there’s any way to turn this situation around and make him “chase” me, well basically understand my worth so we can be something more than whatever we are right now.",dating

3019,"If you have good enough ""game"" in person, can you text 100% platonically?

I never know if it's because I'm too platonic or too flirty or too friendzoney.

If she's really into you and has gone on multiple dates, can you text as just a friend without trying to flirt over text, and only flirt in person on dates? Or is there a point where you have to start flirting over text in our digitally connected society or she thinks that you lost interest?

That is, show interest by talking about your days, sharing music, occasionally making a joke, but no need to tease her over text or say anything risque over text.

It's tough too because, the more interested she is in you, the more she will scroll up and re-re-re-read your texting history.

I've found that women over 30 years old are more forgiving about texting and kind of like it when you text them a lot or use lots of words, but this is a toss up.",dating
3020,Playing hard to get and playing games just means the person is not fully interested.,"I'm looking for an emotional connection, a meaningful long term relationship and I communicate that to my dates.

Who plays hard to get? How do you even do that?

If I act like I'm not interested in a guy it's because I'm really not, it's not a game. If I'm interested in a guy then I will text back and call. I will let a guy know that I want to see him again.

How can a guy want to chase a woman but then say he wants a woman that shows interest and reciprocates his efforts?

3023,am i being to sensitive or are my feelings warranted?,"this guy i have been seeing and i were on the phone after i made it home one night. I had spent the whole day with him at home, and he was on his way to see his friends. i said on the call ""maybe next time we hang out, we can do something."" Idk, maybe it was the way i said it, but his response was ""oh, I'm sorry.""

when i said that there was no need to be sorry, and asked him why he felt the need to say that, he told me that he felt that i was bored of him, and that this was something else he had to ""do,"" he had to ""plan."" 

I told him i simply said that because we'd been hanging out mostly on weeknights after work when it would get dark out early, and that it would be nice to hangout on the weekend. he told me he was busy on weekends, with friend activities, errands and other things. when i asked if we could designate one day (and make it flexible) that we would routinly see each other, he told me ""you'll always want more"" and ""what if a friend's birtday comes up and you get mad.""

at this point i felt discouraged, and he could hear it in my tone. he asked me ""are you ok?"" and i said i was fun but internally i was hurt.

the next day I called him, crying, to tell him that it did hurt me, and that i felt he didn't have time for me, he told me i was overthinking it and that I was seeming unstable. 

&#x200B;

my question is: was i overreacting here and being to sensitive? was I asked for too much? this guy and i had also had previous conversation were i expressed my need for more communication between us, so I wonder if he felt that i was just being too much. Or was I reacting to his insensitivity at all?

we ended up breaking up over this, so this is just me wanting to know if i need to work this.

3024,Girlfriend (F31) does not text me (M30) first and gave pretty dry answers last couple of times despite no figth and everything being good before that.,"So I was intorduced to this girl 3 months ago. She had a previous relationship that lasted 4 years and ended about 8 or 9 monthhs ago. I don't really have long term relationships experience. We both agreed at the beggining that we are looking for a serious relationship. We are both kinda shy and non confrontational, but she is a bit more outgoing that me and has more friends than me.

So anyway, after we were introduced we exchaged numbers and I called her the next day and invited her on a date. The date went well. We went for a walk in the park and along the river and since it went well we then continued it in a nice cafe. Afterwards I met her at her place then she came to mince a couple of times. Then I took her on a(surprise destination) date to another town to a japanese style park to the sakuras bloom and take some more walks.. She was overjoyed since she loves walks and nature and asked me how the hell did I came up with this date idea. After this date she invited me to her place. No sex, but lots of kisses touches and cuddles. I was like ok, thats good progress. A bit slow but good progress. I was happpy with it.

Next week she asks if I want to go on healthy lifestyle camp for a weekend in two weeks. I accepted. A few days later she impromptu asked if I would take her to the seaside thsi week. I asked wdym? She said she has massage courses and maybe I want to tag along so we could hang when she is done in the evenings. I accepted again. Both trips went pretty well. BUT after the last one when we returned on may 28th I started sensing something off.

For example I noticed that she never texted me first after we got back. We text mainly on discord. So I went back a little and realised that she hasn't texted me first in the last 30 days. And that was to confirm if I was 100% going to the healthy lifestyle camp. Last time she texted me just to chat was may 7th :( All the other times I initiated and led the conversation. She usually asks me whats new with me when I text her, but the last couple of conversations were pretty dry and she didn't really asked anything. Our last chat was june 8th. Few days ago I thought to myself  ""I wonder if I will ever talk to her again if I stop texting first?"" And so far 6 days no contact.

Now she DID say she's the type of person who does't need to talk to a person everyday and I was happy with it since I am in the same boat. So I always texted her in the intervals of 2-4 days. She is also busy with farm work so I don't bother her during the day since she can't aswer the phone, so only texts.

I think if a person relly likes another person then no matter what, you CAN find a minute or two of your valuable time check up with them. To show that you care, that you are interested in me, that you think about me from time to time. I worked some heavy time in farms myself. One time 29 days in a month 16 days in a row 9-13 hours a day and still called my folks back home every day so...

...so I don't know. I don't like this situation and I don't want to do this because I really like her personality and we have a few pretty important things in common. But I'm thinking of ending this. Not without giving it another shot tho. So I'm thinking of sending her one last text. Something like this: ""Hey, I just want you to know that I really appreciate the time we spent together, but I get these vibes in the last few weeks that you are just not that interested in me anymore and I think it's best if go our separate ways. Best of luck to you in everything that you do"" IF she responds with ''ok then, you too'' the all is clear. If she will want to figure it out then I will give it another shot.

What do you guys think of this situation? What should I do? Maybe I should send another text? How long should I wait to send that text? My birthday is on july 1st. Should I wait till then or not?

Appreciate you reading this long text for such a relatively small probelm. I just don't have a lot of experiance in relationships. Love you all.",dating

I ignored so many advances everyday until I felt like someone deserved me. My bf (now ex) treated me amazing, I often felt like he loved me TOO much and was TOO possessive and jealous. He always made me believe that he loved me more than I loved him, so I put my full trust in him that he would never hurt me. How could he? When he would tell me the sweetest words and even told me he wanted to marry me and just waiting for my approval..3 years later I start getting suspicious, he was the biggest homophobe. Comically almost. Like would make sure everyone knew how much gay people are sinful and disgusting..I found it weird how passionate he was about this topic..my suspicions started being confirmed after I saw a search for porn that said ""shemale"" I was offended but I let it slide..I assumed guys are just weird and have weird kinks not relating to things they would do in real life. A while back, he started not telling me everything that happened in his day like I would do to him..when I would ask him he would just say he's not talkative, I asked to check his phone and he said no..then yes..after I insisted. I go straight for the chats with girls, everything seemed normal but knowing him I knew he must've deleted something. So I waited till he slept, and used his thumb to unlock his phone. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. I went to his camera roll and found nothing, I was not going to give up I trust my instincts ALOT and every girl knows that feeling when you just KNOW. right before I give up, I found a nude of him on his camera roll. It was saved under ""twitter"". I didn't even know he uses twitter so why the fuck is his nude saved under the twitter album. Anyways, after resetting his twitter account password, I was able to log into his account and see the chats. At this point, I didn't care that he would know I did this because I knew I'm about to see something. I found hundreds and I mean HUNDREDS of chats with guys using terms I never even heard before, disgusting language, exchanging nudes, sexting and much more. His twitter account bio was ""top""...I was shaking so much in disbelief that I had to close the chats from how vile it was. All these days he would always spend with me, now knowing he had an entire secret account like he's living a double life. If anyone saw this guy they would understand why it's so shocking. The biggest problem is, after all this he is not convinced that he is ""gay"" or into guys. He said he was just horny and that he loves me and that he swears he's into women..I feel so destroyed and betrayed..all these times I would reject guys that I KNEW would give me a better life because oh he ""loved"" me more, I disregarded how he looked or how much money he had for ""true love"" and I was genuinely in love with him to the point strangers would tell me you're so pretty you could do so much better and I would DEFEND him. The thing that bothers me is that he was always the first person to give his opinions about homosexuality and how it's wrong and disgusting..like no one even asked you!!! Especially after knowing what I know I don't know where he had the audacity to speak with so much confidence. I broke up with him today but I'm so mentally traumatised and drained. I feel like I want revenge for this betrayal and it hurts me knowing there's nothing I can do and he just gets to continue life like he didn't completely ruin mine and my ability to trust any guy again. He told me im sorry its not you its me and i said i know DAMN WELL ITS YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH so maybe I just got unlucky with a professional double-life liar.

3029,My (34M) GF (28F) Never Wants Sex But Regularly Masturbates to Porn,"My girlfriend of over 6years now, has always had a significantly lower sex drive than me.

It’s was okay at first because we did have a fair amount of sex (2-3times a week) but now we are down to like once or twice a month!

The situation has made me more understanding and educated on women’s sexuality as I’ve done so much research on this over the years because I really love my girlfriend and want this relationship to last. We’ve come such a long way and flourish in almost every other aspect of our relationship.

I also try to ensure she orgasms when we do have sex as we found a position which allows me thrust while she uses her vibrator on her clitoris at the same time. She says she enjoys having sex most of the time but just never is in the mood. But then, she masturbates to Guy-on-Guy porn almost everyday! I’ve also walked in on her masturbating to porn just few minutes after rejecting my advances. I tried to compromise again by asking that we masturbate together when she feels like it, since she prefers masturbating, but even that doesn’t seem to work as she never asks me to masturbate with her and rejects me when I bring it up.

I understand that some people masturbate as a “quick fix”, to release tension. But to be honest, I feel like it is somewhat unhealthy when your mind is conditioned to only enjoy masturbating to porn as a way to release tension. Whether it makes you orgasm in one minute or one hour, dedicating this much time to masturbating till orgasm almost every leaves little opportunity to actually think, want or feel the need to have sex.

It’s our birthday today. This would’ve been our first birthday “together” as well. I thought maybe I’d wake up to a text from him but nothing.

3034,Should I make the first move but it’s my coworkers housemate,"Okay a little backstory. I (23f) am in grad school. Im currently on academic placement in a different city (for a couple more months) but I’m highly considering coming back after I end my masters next year. A couple weeks ago, a coworker was having a go away party and we all went for a few pints. His roommates ended up joining later in the night and I was chatting away to one of them for the rest of the night. I’d say we got along pretty well and although it was only a few hours I talked to him for, I’ve realised I’ve developed a crush on the guy. 

A couple days later i made the massive big step and I followed him on Instagram (I know i sound ridiculous we get it). Anyways, I thought it’d be weird if I just followed him so I followed the coworker (who’s leaving party it was and his roommate) and another one of my coworkers (call her R) that I know is friends with them both. 

That’s it that’s the whole story. I’ve kind of built up this idea in my head that maybe he’s not single or not into me or maybe just was a silly thought to think that just because I followed him on a social media platform that’d he’d message me. He’s also a bit older. My coworker is 26 and he’s from his year so is are DMs not popular with that age range? He hasn’t posted anything since like 2018 which is why I’m prone to think so. 

I was thinking to ask R since she does give me a lift home every day but we’re not very close and I can never get a read on her in terms of if she wants to be better friends or not. But again, I know she friends with them both and maybe asking about the relationship status of the guy I have the crush on would push me more to just go on and message him first.

I know it’s so silly but I just feel like it’d be so weird if I do the wrong thing because it’s a small company I’m working for so I’ll have to see these two coworkers for the next couple of months (well the one who is his roommate is leaving in 2 weeks but the girl gives me a lift home daily so )

3035,Do guys say keep in touch to be polite after a date?,"OK so I'm new to the dating game after quite some time away, and it is so hard out here let me tell you haha. I'm am not very good at reading social cues when it comes to dating, I even struggle to pick up when guys are flirting, so it makes everything 10x harder. While I have a great time, I have no idea if they feel the same which makes me doubt a LOT of things!

I have recently been on a couple of first dates, the most recent was last night. Both of them said the same thing when we parted ways at the end of the night, which was basically saying to keep in touch. The first one I messaged about a week later asking if they wanted to get together again and we are currently organizing a day we are both free (both busy people).

So here's the thing I'm struggling with haha. Do people actually mean it, and want to keep in touch and go on more dates, or are they just saying it to be polite and have no intention of seeing you again?

I usually just tell guys I'll text them tomorrow, tell them to text me tomorrow, or something to that effect. It's to the point and shows intent. But this whole ""keep in touch"" thing is throwing me off haha. And you see all over tiktok about not coming off too strong, don't do this, don't do that, yadda yadda yadda...

I hate this haha",dating
3036,I pre-cum while cuddling,"First post so bear with me.

I 25M have been dating girls. Whenever there is physical touch like cuddling I notice I pre-cum and get a little stain in my shorts. It has been a weird feeling for me since I'm 25 and I thought that phase would be over. I just get too excited and can't controll it.

For who ever is wondering, yes I am still a virgin. 

Is there anyone who has this problem at around my age aswell? And are there things I can do to gain controll over this?

3038,Liar Guy from Bumble,"I met a guy(M27) on Bumble. We matched last March and during that time he’s not the only man I’m talking to. It’s a dating app so expect that people come and go. What I’m looking for a man is someone who is consistent. So to make the story short, out of all he’s the only man who stood up, consistent and I felt that he is really into me. We decided to talk outside bumble and followed each other on instagram, so that’s where we communicate since then. We always chat and video call everyday in even if he’s at work. I can say that he’s a good guy, good looking and has a sense of humor which I like. We’ve been in talking stage for two months then come May 1 we decided to meet and date, that is also the day I said YES to him. And we dated again for the second time lol. So as I’ve mentioned we talk only on IG, I know his full name but we are not mutuals in Facebook. I remember once I’ve search his name in Facebook but I did not see any profile of him. Btw I know where he works and their company has a Facebook page so I got curious. As I dig deep, I found him. I found his Facebook, same face but different name from what he told me. So it means that he didn’t even told me his real name. As I was browsing to his profile I saw a pic of him with a girl and checked the profile of the girl. I learned that she’s currently in a relationship with that girl in the picture. So I called and confronted him over the phone. Asked him why he did that and all. Of course he gave me a lame excuse which I don’t believe and then ended our relationship. I just don’t get it. Why that kind of people exist. Why lie? Why cheat? *shaking my head* Anyway, I made a dummy account on fb so that I can inform the girl that his bf is cheating on her and I am a victim too blahblahblah. But the girl didn’t respond to my chat. I did chat the girl bc I have to give her a heads up. I know how it feels to be cheated on. It’s up to her if she will stay with that asshole after learning those. Another lesson learned. Lol",dating

I then told him that I could only hookup and not date and gave some bullshit excuse as to why. I think I really hurt his feelings and he also told me he isn’t in to casual sex, (which I get) and that the he appreciated that I communicated what I’m looking for. I told him I get it and he never responded again.

3041,"Constantly overthinking and worried that he (M22) might lose interest in me (F19) someday because I need lots of reassurance, any advice please?","Hello everyone, for context I’m F19 and my boyfriend is M22. We actually started texting everyday for a few months now and now we’re dating :) 

At first, our relationship was really smooth-sailing, he would reply my texts really quickly (almost instantly), just was really sweet overall. 

However, in recent months, I don’t know what got into me but I started overthinking about everything. Whenever he would send texts that were kind of “dry” and I didn’t know how to respond to it at all, I would feel a little hurt because what if he somehow lost interest in me or what if I was annoying him and he’s busy. That kind of thing :/ Obviously I’m aware I’m a huge overthinker and he knows because I clearly told him I overthink.

I also made sure I communicated clearly to him that whenever I’m upset I need his reassurance. Or whenever he’s out with friends and couldn’t reply me, I already told him to at least update me that he’s busy (instead of leaving me hanging and wondering what I did wrong) he agreed and understood this. But somehow I just can’t shake this feeling off. Like the feeling somehow he would just get annoyed with me because I’m somehow who needs reassurance. 

When I’m venting to him, I feel like he doesn’t understand how to give me the comfort I need at all. Sometimes he would even just say “calm down” which makes me feel even worse. I told him before that a few simple caring words would really really help me but I still don’t think he knows how to give me reassurance :/ I just hope I don’t put a lot of pressure on him because I’m not asking for much, I genuinely appreciate the small things in our relationship (when he would say “good morning” or ask whether I have eaten, I love those) And it’ll make me feel horrible if one day he feels drained because of me :(

Also lately we’ve been talking a little less than usual, I know he had a lot on his plate nowadays and is really busy but I can’t help but miss our old conversations when everything was sunshine and rainbows.

TLDR; I always overthink in our relationship, bf knows I need reassurance but doesn’t know how to give any, worried he might lose interest",dating

3043,I’m graduating and she’s leaving the country.,"I have been seeing this girl for the last 5 months during University. It has been going well, and we get on like a house on fire. She’s beautiful, easy to talk to and we spend a lot of time bonding over similar interests. However, as I am soon to graduate and she is an international student that will be spending summer away from the country, it has left me feeling uncertain about where our relationship stands.

We have both initially been very open and honest that our relationship may have to be casual due to the difficulties that may arise due to our future priorities, however recently I have grown to have felt more attached and feel that I am not ready to give up on what we have. I believe she feels the same way, as she says that she wants to continue speaking with me over text and video call and wants me to visit when she comes back to the country.

However, I feel that life will be very different in the next couple of months and it won’t be so easy to see her. I have less than a week with her and plan on spending as much of our little time together as possible. 

What should I bring up in conversation in order to set the right boundaries on what our relationship should be? We aren’t technically dating and aren’t committed to each other, however I can’t imagine wanting to be with anyone else right now and would hope she feels the same way. 

I also understand she has other priorities in life and will be focusing on her University work in her final year. Will I have to suck it up and let her go?",dating

3045,Fourth date advice,"Repost because I had no responses before

Hello all, hope this is allowed and I’m using a throwaway account for a few reasons.
Against the odds, I’ve bagged a fourth date - this is despite her saying she’s not ready for more than friends right now/isn’t sure if she’s ready to open up to someone just yet (unsure of what happened in the past relationship).
I’m not sure how much of an actual “date” this will be as it’s more “hanging out” on an evening after work. Of course rather than just going for a walk or sitting down, which we’ve already done - I’d like to make it something a bit more fun and memorable. Keeping it lighthearted and fun seems to be more likely what’s going to give that push ahead (I hope, anyway). I was thinking of something like bowling, going to the arcade or maybe even just a couple of games of pool.
Personally I’m thinking maybe the arcade or bowling would be a bit more fun as it gives a bit more of a chance for some physical contact and keeping things flirty and competitive in a fun way rather than a serious manner.
If it’s of any use, we already have kissed but nothing more.
We’re both in our mid twenties and I’m a guy. Any advice would be appreciated especially as it’s tomorrow ;)",dating
3046,How do I get him to be more verbally affectionate?,"I’m (22 F) in a relatively new relationship (22M) that is so so healthy and good for me and I am so happy but my boyfriend rarely compliments me or tells me how he feels about me. I want to bring this up to him but I don’t know how. 
He is great at showing his affection in other ways but he is just not very expressive with his words. I am the complete opposite and always feel the need to tell people how highly I think of them (when it’s true lol) whether it’s a SO, family member, friend, etc. but his lack of expression can sometimes subconsciously make me hold back on telling him how I feel about him. Not always though. His guy friends literally compliment my appearance (non flirtatiously) more than he does when we go out together. Most of the verbal reassurance I get regarding how he feels about me is also from his friends saying that he talks about me all the time and that they’ve never seen him happier with anyone else etc. I actually think compliments that’re almost “behind my back” like that are more valuable because they feel more genuine, but it’s frustrating that I get to hear all these nice things from everyone but the person I care the most to hear them from. 

Luckily, I consider myself a very confident and secure person that does not rely on external validation to determine how I feel about myself, nor do I NEED constant reassurance of how people feel towards me… but I still really love to hear it. 
This has been something I’ve noticed for a while but I decided not to address it because I know that is just the way he is and I don’t take it personally. However, we are starting long distance soon and I am worried that I will crave verbal reassurance a lot more and therefore need to address this. I feel like receiving verbal affection sticks and is one of the longer lasting forms of affection to hold onto and that is something I think will be especially valuable when doing long distance. 

We have a very jokey relationship and he is very non confrontational so I thought about bringing it up in a joking manner but I don’t want him to miss the point and dismiss it. Thoughts? I definitely don’t want the conversation to be too heavy because it’s not a real issue in the relationship, rather a preference. I also don’t want to come off secure or needy, but I am trying to normalize expressing my wants and needs in all relationships and I think everyone else should do the same. I want to point out that his friends compliment me more than he does (this wouldn’t cause any jealousy, he knows it’s just friendly) because I think he’s genuinely oblivious and that could be a good wake up call for him but I don’t want him to think that I am comparing him or trying to change him. I think that mentioning how this relates to concerns for our future long distance relationship could be helpful too but I don’t want to make this “issue” sound more problematic than it is.

I have an amazing girlfriend . We love each other very much. My girlfriend got transferred to a new department which requires her to travel interstate once a month for a week or so for her work.

I am not worried about her cheating and all that because we are solid. But I am worried of her safety. She is not going alone. She will probably travel with more than one work collegue (her department currently has one other women and one guy). They will be driving to most of their destinations

3050,Odd Question?,"So, I’ve been seeing a girl for 3 weeks now. At first her interest wasn’t that high, now it’s starting to creep up a little bit. She is now starting to text me good morning, initiate contact, etc. Things are heading in the right direction (hopefully). 

She is a shy person. I’m usually doing the majority of the talking, but she has been slowly opening up more and more. She loves physical touch, and she genuinely has to be touching me in some capacity or be really close to me while hanging out, which suffices for lack of words.

So, one thing she always does on dates when I stop talking for a minute is asks me “are you bored of me” or “are you getting bored”i’m not sure if this is a self conscious thing or what— but i genuinely am just stopping for a sec to enjoy a moment of quite and non verbal connection.

3051,I [M26] have been single since 2016 and im not really sure what to do about it.,"I wasn't really sure where to post this. If this is the right place ok, if not just as well. This may sound a bit like a rant but I assure you it isn't. Please read it in a level-headed tone as that is how it was written. 

  
As the title of this post indicated I have been single since high school. With a handful of hookups that I chose to end (not really interested in dating people I would just hook up with occasionally). I would say I have grown immensely since then, as everyone does, to become a pretty functional person in society. I think I am fairly attractive (female friends have told me as much as well). I'd say I am a solid 7 on a regular day with up to an 8.5 if I dress up. I am well-groomed with my beard, teeth, and face (and bathing of course).  I am 6' tall with a BMI of 26 and have a pretty average body-fat percentage. I have quite a few hobbies which means I always have something to do. I am an engineer, meaning I make quite a bit of money (enough to throw around at least). I'm a pretty honest and respectful person regardless of who I am interacting with. I don't have any issues talking with people. I keep a decent garden and am good with animals. I also like to cook. There is much more but this isn't a bio for a dating profile.  
I work at a STEM startup and there aren't any women there.  I don't really go to bars or 'clubs' (Im not a partier). Given the size of my town, there aren't really any groups outside of shooting guns and going mudding (Guns are fine, just not my kind of people). I am secular so I don't go to church.  Family/Freinds are useless in this pursuit in that the last person someone tried setting me up with was grossly overweight with 3 kids. (She was nice, just not interested in that)  
I have tried online dating with negative success. It has done nothing for me other than destroy my self-esteem. Had a date one time, this girl tried to get me to pay for dinner after just sitting and scrolling on her phone from minute one.  
I really only have two non-starter requirements in my dating:  
\- She can't be more overweight than me. (unless we had kids of course, these are just for dating)  
\- I won't date someone who already has kids. (Not trying to waste my time on that)

  
I guess my main question is. In order to have any luck dating, do I just need to put up a facade, going mudding or 'clubbing' and pretending to be a part of that crowd just to meet people? (I use these just as reference to activities that people do that I'm not the slightest interested in) Do I need to cut my two requirements to date someone that I am certain, I will not have a fulfilling relationship with on my end? I am genuinely at a loss for direction. I've done a lot of soul-searching in the last 7 years and that has led me here but I dont see any light in this tunnel.",dating

3053,My ex I had an abortion with is now expecting with his current girlfriend.,"I (24f) was with my ex (26m) for almost two years on and off. When we first started seeing each other we were both at really bad spots in our lives. I had just gotten out of a  toxic relationship with my son’s dad And he was in active addiction, along with just doin a lot of bad stuff. At first he didn’t tell me he was still actively doing bad stuff and he told me he was getting sober. I fell really hard really fast so I kind of ignored all the red flags. After only a month of being together I ended up getting pregnant and neither of us were ready at all and I have a child. Considering I just got out of a relationship and already had one child, and was still trying to heal from all that, and he was nowhere near ready to settle down and be a father, It was a mutual agreement to get an abortion, but it was still just a really sad thing we both went through. After that, a lot happened in our relationship, I think we both really loved each other but we were in so much pain individually and had a lot of things we had to heal from, That we just weren’t good together at that point. He ended up going to jail last year in September after getting drunk and starting a fight with my son’s father. When he went to jail we weren’t together because I had broken up with him a couple weeks prior for getting really drunk and abusing me physically. When he was in jail though we still talked and were trying to work it out. I ended up meeting someone and left him while he was in jail for this other person. My current boyfriend is a pretty stable guy and very kind. We’ve been together a little over seven months now and we haven’t even raised our voices at other, let alone be bad to each other. Anyway, About four days ago or so I had a dream about my ex and when I woke up it wouldn’t leave my head so I Ended up unblocking his current girlfriend off Facebook (I had never talked to her before but when I found out he was with someone new, I didn’t want to bring myself to have to see that so I just ended up blocking her) When I looked at her Facebook profile I saw that they were expecting. I do not hate this girl and I don’t hate my ex. I genuinely wish the best For both of them. My ex has a lot of potential that he wasn’t using when he was in active addiction and it sucks because I saw all of that potential, but He’s sober now and doing really good things as far as I can see and I’m really happy for him, And as far as his girlfriend, I don’t know anything about her, but it seems that they’re happy and doing well. The only reason this hurts me is because there is a part of me that still hasn’t moved on from him. I would never try to get in between the relationship and I don’t want to leave my current boyfriend, But as bad as our relationship was, I was thoroughly in love with my ex. I wanted so bad for us to work out but it just never got better. And so now I see him living the life with someone else that I wanted with him so badly. It hurts that we weren’t ready for our baby so I had to get rid of my baby and she gets to keep hers. And I just hate that he’s treating her with such kindness and so much love and doing things for her to make their lives better when it was like pulling teeth to get him to do that for me. It’s all just making me feel not worth much at all and like there was something wrong with me for me to have gotten treated like that but she gets the best version of him. I don’t wish bad on them, I don’t feel anger or bitterness, just an overwhelming feeling of why the fuck wasn’t I worth doing all that for. And I have no idea how to move on from it.",dating

I never considered us to have issues till a couple weeks ago when she started distancing herself. I asked her about it with nothing but denial and tons of assurance that I was making it up. This last Saturday, we went out and we got into an argument about staying out longer or not and it finished with me leaving her with her friends per her request as I went home.

3057,Love language and money,"I don't really understand why the love language from men's end is supposed to be related to buying stuff for her and making her feel special in that way. I was talking to a girl on random vc and she kept saying that the guy who she is trying to get back with was so great and changed suddenly, but she kept mentioning ""He spent money on me"" again and again, like to the point that it was noticeable that she is pressuring this.

Now ofc people might go ""she was only in for money"" and shit but from her voice it just seemed like .... well that made her feel secure... as in, if anyone to come and say ""may be it was just you who thought it was that way and he didn't like you"", the money thing would be a valid point to prove that he cared. So it felt genuine and not the ""only wants money"" vibes, as in it has to be a thing that he makes her confident about him liking her.

And not only that, I have seen loads of people talking about where should the date be, how much money should he be spending, how much should the ring cost and what not. We still have strong gender norms, agreed, and there are those that harm both genders. But I feel like this one is relatively less talked about. From my POV it's even more so about how much valued I would feel, even if you give me all the money in the world, almost all of the norms in ""dating"" (not marriage, coz after marriage, people work as a team and if they decide to stick to gender roles or contribute half in both, either case is good partnership), would make me feel like it's more about making her feel special by buying expensive stuff, getting expensive ring, bending on knee, taking her to places and all. Sure, there are men who strongly prefer these to be their roles, but I feel like these things are kinda one sided when it comes to feeling valued.

Compared to that, my sense of security in a relationship would come from things like: does she care about my hobbies, does she take interest when am talking about what I like, does she take an extra step to research about things I like when she doesn't know about it, does she initiate the conversations and reply on time (in case she is away) and make me feel prioritised a bit.

So... yeah I do not mind spending money but I just do not feel like the norms make me feel valued at all, until the marriage it is almost like I as a male am trying to impress her and then ofc in the end begging her to be with me on a knee with a (and it really hurts to see women having a standard for the price to that ring) expensive piece of stone ... and that is the only way it proves that a man loves you. People go and say ""oh so you don't want to spend money"" well, the love language being the money makes me feel like am just my money or replaceable so easily.",dating

I typically default to social avoidance. Been needing and wanting to work on this. Need to work on myself, social skills, and confidence. Just have a hard time keeping it together with so much responsibility and not a community to help. I moved to a small town where I had no roots. Live in a town of approximately 6k. It’s just been difficult to get connected with two little ones in tow. They go to small private school so their extra curricular activities are limited.  I’m never around other adults my age on a regular basis often. I just never really have anybody to share the load. I’ve tried online dating in the past. It’s been a struggle. I’ve connected once or twice. It’s never exactly been convenient or right. One seemed toxic and struggled with an sex addiction and we never met up. The other was going through a divorce. We connected well but it was hard to keep the conversation going. She was going through a divorce and struggled with depression. We didn’t talk for a bit and she started talking to another guy. Both of them lived at least an hour drive away. Nobody close nearby my small town seems to be on the apps. Some days I question my worth and struggle with my confidence. It’s like I’d like to love and be loved and accepted but not sure I’m worthy of it at times. It’s hard to connect. It’s hard to meet others in person. If I meet somebody sometimes there is a strong initial connection and things quickly deteriorate and we are just strangers. I know I’m separate from my kids but becaus I have no help with them it’s hard to find balance. It’s hard for me to make friends and find hobbies and they not be around. It’s like I was not prepared to have good successful relationships when I was young. Maybe I’m a bad communicator. It’s like I’m chasing my tail. How do I even succeed at this? How do I get good at communicating? How do I get confident? How do I attract and meet successful women who is genuinely a good person? When I talk to somebody how do I keep the conversation interesting and going? I don’t want to always carry the conversation. Sometimes I feel like women just want a man to carry the conversation and to entertain them. It’s like I sacrifice everything as a solo parent and don’t have much to devote to the dating game. I have this greater need for relationship. I’m in conflict because it’s something I want but feel bad for wanting it. Maybe I’m afraid of getting hurt again. It’s also difficult being a single parent. How do you do it?",dating
3060,What do Indian men think of Persian women?,I’m a 22 year old Turkic-Persian woman that noticeably gets hit on by Indian men everywhere she goes. I understand that we’re at an age where flirting and approaching is normal but this thing about Indian men has particularly stood out to me because it happens too often. When they ask where I am from and I say Iran they go “that’s why you’re hot” as if it’s a cultural fetish or something. I told an Indian guy that was complimenting me that I find Indian girls very attractive too and he said “eww nahh.” That’s really embarrassing. Does anyone know the story behind this cultural fetishization?,dating
3061,Modern World Dating,"I feel as if people nowadays bring so much baggage and stress into a relationship. I’m in no means perfect, But dealing with my issues alone is stressful and meeting someone that has a bunch of issues also just makes my life feel twice as stressful! It almost feels as if I’m personally not built for a relationship at the moment. I like an easy, simple, stress free life and I don’t think most relationships offer that. Hopefully one day I meet someone that doesn’t make my life more difficult 😅

3062,UK meeting girls in real life; Suggestions,"Sick of dating apps. 27M, want to meet a girl in real life, hence need social groups etc. My type: intelligent, voluptuous (sigh wish I didn't have this) but not fat, good person, active, mentally only as crazy as all of us but not actually crazy, passionate about something. Bonuses: gym(weights)/sport doer (cycling etc), videogamer, likes deep discussions and debating.

Approaching isn't a thing in the UK. Need to have a social aspect first.

My ideas: Salsa class (I do this anyway), cycling group, gym social groups? (Dont know any), debating? Basically my issue is what activities do girls tend to actually do that I could benefit from? Honestly yoga might try because I do need flexibility. Gonna restart boxing but I do it seriously; as in a nasty serious boxing gym not boxercise; do any girls tend to? Anything else worthwhile? Speed dating or singles events at all worth it? Open to all ideas; will try Anything new once 😉


Edit: As horrible as it sounds, are there any collections of voluptuous girls in social events? I know it's shallow as hell but it's about a 1 in 10 at best thing in the Uk and its just so physically baked in to 'my type' that my last girlfriend with an amazing personality I couldn't fall for because she was classic skinny tall model type.

Like at one point there was this girl who goes to the gym at the same time as me and one day she just bends her ass like a metre in front of me, and I still have no reaction like bro.

But at the end of the night she was driving me home and I was in the back of the car when she dropped me off because her friend was sitting in the front so I wasn’t really able to do anything other then say bye. And the worst part is the other friend that was on the date with kept telling me that I needed to make a move by the end of the night either by hugging, kissing, holding hands. Anything, and I did none of that. I could tell she was kind of expecting it too because she kept whispering to my date that I might do something. So how badly did I screw up? First date btw.

But after our date she told me that she doesn't want a relationship with me. Yesterday I had coffee with her (as friends) and she was quite sweet. She told me maybe it's the last time we see each other and gave me gifts. She also wrote me a letter on a heart shaped paper in my mother tongue using Google Translate (we are from very different countries) where she told me very nice things. She told me we'll stay in touch. In the end I have mixed feelings. I was crying while I was smiling. On one hand I am quite sad that I couldn't have a relationship with her and that I couldn't really lose my virginity to her. On the other hand I am happy that I finally kissed a girl, I experienced kind of intimacy with a girl for the first time and she has nice thoughts about me.

3069,String of “Great” First Dates that Leads to Ghosting (29F),"I (29F) have been on several 1st dates in the span of 1 years time that have lead nowhere. 

All of these men are from different demographics whether it’s age, education, income, ethnicity, etc. 

I have also met them through various methods such as dating apps, from work, other places around the city, etc.

They would also claim to want a serious relationship or at least date to find a long term partner so I can only assume they’re telling the truth.

The problem is, they’ll ask me out on our 1st date, they’ll plan it, pay for everything, we’ll have what most people would constitute as a great time, and they will even ask me on another date, talk to me for days after, but then…gone.

If I met them on the apps, we typically would FaceTime before hand and I take pride in my looks and hygiene so I wouldn’t think it’s either of those. We will chat for days, some of which we’ll talk on the phone like teenagers or old friends, for hours and hours, so I would not think it’s my personality either. When we go out I’ve had waiters, venue employees, and even strangers stop what they’re doing to compliment that we look great together and even offered free things like free drinks, another round of golf, etc because they liked our vibe. I visibly see their faces light up when we meet up or when these people compliment us so I would think that is a great sign. 

During the dates we’ll laugh at each others jokes, talk about topics ranging from our backgrounds, celebrity news, global warming, what have you, and it never gets heated or awkward. The 1st date could last for hours I even had a few where we spent all day together because they did not want me to leave. None of these encounters were sexual, at most it would end in a kiss that they would plant on me. Promptly after they ask when they can see me again and we’ll make plans for our next date.

Afterwards, we’ll talk for a few days after. The 1st day after, business as normal. Then after day 3, I can tell the interest is waning. The messages are becoming less frequent, the conversation is no longer voice memos, calls or long text but just 1 sentence responses, if I’m lucky. Then by day 4-5, poof. It’s like they never had my number. 

I’ve asked my friends, family, even gone to a therapist to see if it’s something I may have said or done. Maybe it’s the clothes I wore. Maybe they didn’t like my perfume or a joke I told. I have even tried adapting different techniques on the next date, but I get the same scenario. 

I would be lying if I didn’t say this has affected my self esteem a bit. I just want to know why? Is this the climate of modern dating?",dating
3070,My (22F) boyfriend (27M) doesn't want any intimacy or romance whenever he is going through stressful times,"We have been dating for 2.5 years and our relationship has been hitting rock bottom for the past few months. Every day there is less and less desire for my boyfriend to be romantically involved with me. It is like we are becoming exclusively platonic and I can't do anything about it.  
  
He is still my best friend and the only person who can really understand me but there is almost no romance, intimacy, or even desire to do something fun and new together. From my side, I want and crave all those things and I am extremely jealous when I see couples kissing or even holding hands. But for him this is all a burden, these things are not on his mind and he feels this is something he has to do to so I don't complain.  
  
Of course, it is related to the fact that he is very stressed right now, having a hard time finding a job but this is not the first time it is happening. It has happened a couple of times already when he was in stressful situations. The thing is after those stressful phases are over we have great moments and love is back on the table. Even during the stressful phases sometimes we have a good laugh and he is able to support me emotionally. Since it is both mine and his first relationship I have no idea whether these things are happening in every relationship and I just should learn to accept it or it is something that I shouldn't compromise on. Would really appreciate any advice  
  
TLDR: Whenever my boyfriend is going through a stressful phase we become exclusively platonic and I don't know if that is the right reason to let go of a good relationship.",dating
3071,Girl doesn't seem to care after parting ways,"I (23) met this girl (20) a few weeks ago at work and it was a bit like ""love"" at first sight. She instantly started to like me really much, got touchy and was fantasizing about the future.
We were dating until now.

But yesterday we met and she told me that maybe it is better to end it now then later, because she is really afraid of getting hurt (she is extremely jealous bcs she knows I can pull girls) and don't want to risk being with me for a year and then the pain would be bigger. She said maybe we should be friends. Obviously I was pissed and said that I dont want no friendship. I was ready to leave and then she told me that she didn't mean it like that and that she really wants me and we kissed very passionatelly.

And now I'm really perplexed. I texted her that I'm confused and that maybe it's better if we part ways (like she did), bcs I dont want to get hurt either, hoping that she would say to me that I dont have to worry about what she said, but she just took it like that and said that I could block her.

I said that I enjoyed our time together and she just said it's ok, go if you want to, and after that a childish ""😢"" smiley.
But by responding like she doesn't care I think she is the one that left. I didnt mean it like that but she's just ice cold about it and left me on read...

To be fair, I know she doesn't have much experience with dating and with men in general..

Any advice on how to deal with that? I kinda want her, but shes confusing me..",dating
3072,"Why is it after the first date, no matter how well it went, I end up feeling like I never want to text them ever again?","Seriously, what is wrong with me? I met up with this guy 3 days ago and we had a really great time. We literally hung out for 5 and a half hours and it was really good. I felt like I could be myself around him.

And then after when we text each other I just...I'm repulsed? He was attractive to me in the beginning and now I just don't want anything to do with him. Like??? Can anyone explain?

This feels so shitty of me and it keeps happening over and over again.

I'm not much of a texter, I don't text anyone and I really really don't like it when i text someone everyday. He's texting me everyday and I feel like I get no free time to myself. All I can think about is having to text him and what to say, trying to come up with some message that doesn't make it sound like I'd rather be left alone.

Don't get me wrong, I like texting sometimes and it can feel really good to have a conversation that flows really well. But most of the time I just want to be left alone.

3076,Girls that get too sensitive before climaxing/can't climax,"Tldr: my gf gets too sensitive to climax before she ever gets there, is there any advice? I really want to help her get as much enjoyment as possible, but we've never been able to get her there.

The Tldr kinda sums it up but to give a little more info. I was her first, in basically everything (excluding one incident when she was much younger but that's not mine to talk about) other than she kissed one guy before me. I have had somewhere around 40ish partners before her. Not trying to act like a keyboard warrior or anything but I'm pretty decent in bed. Ive had most of the women I've  been with (since prly #10 or so, i figured out what I'm into and how to do things in general around that time) comment on me being pretty good and almost all desired something longer than just random hookup. Also I listen cuz I want to give the women a good time,  and I'm very not selfish, at least for a guy in the bedroom. I've had several scenarios where I never finished because the girl came too many times and couldn't continue due to exhaustion. I really enjoyed those encounters, more than any other scenarios (besides the scenes with my current gf) despite not finishing myself. And, I love to use toys and eat out, as long as hygiene is good, so it's not that I'm just being selfish. We're both into kinda rougher things but nothing too extreme. I will admit, it is somewhat damaging to my pride. I feel much the same way as I'm sure women feel when they're with a guy and he can't get it up, or he can't finish (to anyone out there that has been ashamed of themselves in these last two scenarios, don't. It happens from time to time, neither men nor women should feel ashamed for this) except  it's been several years at this point and I feel like a failure as a lover. She says she doesn't have any issues with it, and I'm not sure if she says that cuz she's just never reached climax (even on her own) or if it's a genuine contentedness, or if she's just trying to say that in order to assuage any doubts I have due to it. We should probably talk more about our sex, so I can get a better idea of what she likes more and less again cuz it has been a few months and things may have changed, but she feels uncomfortable talking about it most the time for some reason.

<Also, this is another point I'd like to ask about: why is it some ppl (in this case I'm asking specifically for women) find it difficult/embarrassing/etc to be sexual, mostly in conversation but also just over the phone and occasionally in person, with their partner when they've had a history of being very open about it in the past with strangers?>

So the situation with my gf and I is mostly outlined above, I understand we have some specific personal hiccups in our relationship, but it's not just an ""us/her"" issue. I've heard from 3 other women that they've never been able to reach climax, alone or with a partner, so this isn't an isolated issue.

I'm curious and would like to hear specifically from women that have this issue, have had this issue but overcame it, guys in relationships where this has/is happening, or sex therapists/coaches.",dating

I genuinely would love to meet the love of my life but ultimately I feel like it is just a fantasy, or a pipe dream at this point. 

I will say though after deleting all my dating apps, and not being on them for months, I’ve seen how they are so addictive and that they give so false hope. But I’m willing to give it another shot but with a clearer picture in mind. Don’t know if I should or not.

3084,How do I prevent abandonment/neglect trauma from messing up my relationships big time? Also how can you substitute kissing and cuddling with others?,"I have quite some abandonment/neglect issues from my family. I obviously predicted something like this would happen. As I'm properly getting out in the dating scene I'm noticing to what extent my past experiences are gonna mess up my potential romantic relationships.

Essentially, I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between having genuine romantic attraction to someone or feeling good about the attention or idea of having a romantic relationship. I'm also experiencing the problem that whenever I get slightly close or deep (emotionally) with someone I just want full-blown cuddles and almost/full-blown kissing.

Currently I'm loosely dating someone. The situation is very messy. Essentially she's not sure if she's full-blown romantically attracted to me, especially since in the next few weeks a thing will happen that will probably change our relationship for good. Our personalities are not a good mix, but regardless we end up in some intimate situations. We have cuddled a bit. And that's the problem. We acknowledge the situation is complicated and it's best to wait, we acknowledge that maybe we're like oil and water. But my body just wants to latch onto her like an octopus as things are now. And it's been embarrassing for me.

3088,should i tell my bf about my coworkers hitting on me?,"(TLDR @ the end) 

Hi! So my bf & I (both 21) have been together for a few months now and I recently moved back home from school for the summer, which means going back to work as a waitress in our hometown. I’ve worked in restaurants since I turned 16, so i’m used to my coworkers being a little creepy towards me. 

I started working at this particular place while I was dating my ex and it became an issue. He came in to see me a few times while I was working, and then my coworkers were talking about me & teasing me about him. He’s 6’2 and over 300 lbs and while I wasn’t ashamed of him, everyone I worked with told me I could do better and that I was way out of his league. Obviously, I didn’t tell him any of this, but I did tell him some of the little comments guys made towards me. He was very insecure and I think I only made this worse. He was protective and “didn’t trust other guys”, which just made me believe he had no trust in me. Among other things, this led to the end of our relationship. 

Anyway, a few days ago I was with my bf and another couple and someone suggested we get dinner at my job. I was hesitant because I knew bringing him in would result in people talking about me and my relationship and this time around I’d rather avoid that as much as possible lol. But I didn’t want him to think I am ashamed or embarrassed or whatever of him, so I went along with it. And everything went good! Until I get a text from one of the cooks (who’s 33m btw) at 1am telling me how good I looked and it was a shame I was with my bf. I didn’t answer him, but I also didn’t say anything to my bf about it. I feel guilty about lying by omission, as my mom would call it. However, I don’t want to talk to him about it if it’ll just make him insecure and uncomfortable with me working there. Then I worked last night and the coworker was there and flirting with me again. He also told all the other kitchen guys about it who proceeded to question me about my relationship & say i’m breaking their hearts. I try to shut them down but they say it’s just jokes and i’m being too sensitive. 

It makes me uncomfortable to keep things from my bf but sharing stuff has only caused problems for me in the past. I also know that my bf and his ex broke up after he found her cheating on him & i’m worried keeping secrets is a slippery slope. Should i just not mention it or does that count as lying? I don’t want to make mistakes and ruin this… any advice? 



TLDR: Do I need to tell my bf about coworkers flirting / texting me or will it just cause unnecessary problems??",dating

I got divorced about a year and half ago. I took some time away from dating after that and then was in a relationship for a few months earlier this year. That was with a friend who knew my history so I didn't really ever have to like ""fill her in"" on my history.

So this is new for me having to broach this topic with someone who I've really just met. I don't want it to be like this big thing that's kept down low for a long time, but I also don't want to just dump it on someone too soon.

It's worth emphasizing that I rarely find myself physically attracted to women, making it unlikely for me to move on and find someone else. And I simply don't have the interest or motivation to make an effort at this time. However, I do have a strong desire for my ex. I still have feelings for her, but I would rather explore a relationship with no strings attached. As for my ex, she has given up on making our relationship work, but she admits she still has feelings for me. Maybe we can come to an agreement on this setup without commitments or responsibilities? How do I bring it up without it being weird? We're currently in a long-distance situation, so I'm considering whether I should reach out to her before she forgets about me or wait until I return to my home country in a couple of months.",dating
3092,I (32f) need help on what to do with my bf of 2 yrs (32m),"How do I know they are my person?

I want to preface this by saying I love my man. he is an amazing guy and I respect him so much.
On the other hand I am 32 y/o and feel like i dont have time to waste on someone who isn't my ""the one"" but I also dont want to give up a really good man and ""miss out"" ah the eternal struggle of romance 🤦‍♀️
anyway here are the facts and feel free to ask any follow up questions:
im starting with the pros keep in mimd these are broad:
he is legitimately a GOOD MAN, he doesnt hit me or gaslight or anything like that, he has his issues of course but overall he treats me very well.
he is kind to me and if i need him he will be there in a blink (sometimes he's there even if i tell him not to be! let me know if you want to hear the hospital story)
he is reliable and for the most part capable of taking the lead in any situation
he is smart as hell and sly as a fox, he learns almost anything logical super fast its awesome
he is incredibly dedicated to his work, very passionate, ambitious, determined everything you could want in an employee. as a result of this he makes good money. not crazy but enough to be comfortable. yes i enjoy it (i make less) yes i appreciate it, yes he spoils me sometimes (usually just a really good meal at a fancy restaurant but yay food 🤤😍) and yes i live a better life on his dime. i recognise and appreciate all of that but if he was broke tomorrow A: ive got us covered and B: i would not love him any less.I also respect and admire his hard work although i worry about his health a bit cuz he has a habit of burning the candle at both ends.
im keeping this one short and sweet but it is a factor, he is a good generous lover.
he also got lucky in the genetic lottery he is good looking and the lucky bastard can eat whatever he wants and at worst he gets bloated and poops it out after 2 days of eating reasonably. i am a woman and wideness runs in my family so hell ya i'm jelous!
he's also quick as a whip and really funny
hes a great pillow and gives great hugs and cuddles one of my favorite things we do together is just cuddle up in bed and play zelda on our switches hehe

on to the negatives, now here im not going to include the little things that dont matter just the big things that stay stuck in my head:

he doesnt want to marry. ever. im not catholic (far from it) but i never even considered the idea of not marrying in my lifetime. he has had bad examples of relationships in his life and is purely a logical person, if he doesnt see it as an advantage he doesnt do it. ive looked up the legals and financials of marriage in my country and he isnt wrong common law is more or less the same in benefits the only difference ive found is if you marry divorce is a much more difficult thing and potential dammages to both sides are bigger so i get that part. but emotionaly i hate it, it would make me feel much more secure and fulfilled in our relationship.

his work ethic is a double edged sword. he is a textbook workaholic to which there are benefits that i'm grateful for but it does mean that he works long hours etc. which means a few things; when he is home he is exhausted which means A he has no energy for me and B i end up taking care of 98% of the household stuff which i wouldnt mind but i work full time too so its a lot. he almost always is thinking and talking about work which gets annoying/boring over time. this brings up the discomfort of thinking about my future wondering if i'm ok living that life of having a good man and good money but a partner that is rarely there and even more rarely actually present in the moment.

and big thing 3 kind of relates to his work but not completely. there are times when he just doesnt listen. i'll tell him about a dinner coming up or an appointment i have etc and it goes in one ear and out the other. it also has the effect that he is so absorbed in his work that he doesnt think to ask/ care what's going on with me, my day at work, my stories, my feelings etc i never get to express them because he is so busy talking about his work.

he also has the emotional intelligence of a spoon. im not kidding i'm not even sure this man HAS mental health let alone what state it is in. which in some ways is beneficial because he is a very simple creature and i never have to worry about reading between the lines or anything he is super straight forward. but i have anxiety, depression, adhd, and bpd. he just doesnt undertand it at all and in a way ""doesnt care"" he cares about me and how to help me but doesnt care to learn about it to really understand me. dont get me wrong i have had to take med leave during the time we have been together and he completely has my back it just doesnt make sense to him.

so there it is the summary of my man and my relationship and my dilemna. I hope someone out there can help me understand how to make the right move",dating
3093,Why do so many men cheat?,"I’ve found this throughout my 20s, but as a  32F, I have often found myself in situations with men who have a girlfriend. Whether it is on a night out or a colleague from work, I often find men making a pass at me despite seemingly being in a happy relationship, going on to get engaged, married etc. Why are so many men tempted to stray? Is it having something they can’t have? Or simply for fun? Surprised that in my 30s this continues to happen so often.",dating

3095,I am trying to support my significant other through school but I now have given too much of myself to do so. I am now suffering trying to take on what she needs but I also don’t want it to ruin her chances at graduation. Please help with any advice or perspective you have 🙏🏼,"My partner [27F] and I [28M] have been together for 2 1/2 years. I care deeply about her and over that time I have done everything I can to make her life as easy as possible.

As a back story she is currently going to school to become a nurse, and is working full time in the healthcare field already. I am so proud of her for doing so. She has achieved almost straight A’s which is an amazing feat and I see how hard she works. She moved in with me around a year ago under the assumption that she would help with rent and take on some bills. I would say the agreement had her paying around 25% of our total living costs as I understand she is in school which comes with its own expenses and I have a career level job that pays more than her current job. That has not happened at all and I have been paying for most things other than groceries. I slowly agreed to this change as I felt like I was doing my part to support her in our relationship. I also study with her for multiple hours a night, at some points have written essay for her, and have made her schooling a priority in my life. I usually try my best to put my own work or feelings aside when helping her as she tells me that she doesn’t need the added stress of concerns of mine when she is focused on school. This is her 2nd attempt at a bachelors degree as well so she places a lot of importance on graduating which I am all for supporting.

The trouble comes in the fact that I have almost entirely given up friendships, stopped going out, placed myself in debt, and driven myself to a terrible place just trying to support her. I never planned to take on a persons college living in terms of expenses nor was I prepared to give up so much of myself to do so. I also neglect my job to take care of her needs on days which I am very very uncomfortable with. I have always been a person that puts a lot of emphasis on growing my career and while I am proud of what I have accomplished, I am  not well off enough to relax now. 

We have been having frequent fights about my feelings and I try to explain how much of myself I’ve given up to make her happy and take things off her shoulders. When faced with what I pay and how much I contribute to our apartment she says “If I wasn’t here you’d still have to pay all of that so what does it matter?” I admit she’s right that yes I would but it hurts a lot since I am trying my best. I try to tell her that I need me time, or I would like to be allowed to go out with friends after work, but most days she is worried about her next test or a paper she has so she tells me that takes priority and she needs help. 

My friends dislike her since she the reason that I am no longer as active of a friend. She also does not like them as I have a mix of male and female friend and she does not believe that members of opposite genders can just be friends so she is wary of my friends. 

I care deeply about her and I want to be the reason she succeeds but I’ve given too much. I now don’t recognize myself and I wake up dreading what new nursing chapter I’m going to have to study today even though I’m not in school. I can’t keep going at this level but I’ve already been warned that if I just do what I want she will take our dog and walk out the door. 

What do I do? I feel like if I choose my comfort I destroy a relationship I’ve put everything into (not to mention losing our dog we have together). But if I don’t I fear there maybe major mental health issues ahead for me as I already am feeling the effects. I also don’t want to be a reason that she isn’t able to graduate or her grades suffer as I know how hard she has to work. I would never forgive myself if I hurt her chances at finally graduating.",dating
3096,I found out that my crush ( my close friend ) has no crush,"me and my crush are very close friends. We correspond almost every day, he worries about my health and always compliments me. Although we know each other not so long ago.

he says that he does not worry about it and did not purposefully look for a girlfriend. But if the opportunity falls, he does not mind starting a relationship with someone.

I do not understand whether I should even hope that we can be in a relationship. he said that I am a good person and he likes me (just as a person). We are very open to each other, he says that I can ask him what I want and when I want.

what do you think about this? Please share your opinion.",dating
3097,Do I stay or leave?,"8 months ago I (21/M) was talking to an amazing girl (21) who I really liked, the chemistry was amazing but we never caught up. Eventually I got the impression she was not interested because I was starting to get ghosted. But basically nothing started so nothing really ended…

Anyway a month and a half ago we ended up talking again and the chemistry we first had was back instantly. We caught up once since then because we are both very busy and we had such a good time and she even sent me a nice message afterwards when I got home saying “thank you so much for tonight I had a really good time x”. Anyway we had still been talking and I wanted to see her again.

I tried asking her out and inviting her to things I was doing but she was too busy or not overly keen to join. But whenever she rejected my invitations she would be so nice to me and show so much interest. 

Anyway I decided I should just tell her I have feelings for her so a few nights ago I did (over the phone unfortunately). She said she also had feelings but was still healing from her ex and that we are both so busy so she had been pushing them back. To this day we still talk but it’s getting hard because I want more, she says she also has feelings but won’t act on them. Why is she keeping me around/am I setting myself of up for disappointment by sticking around? 

I assume this might just be ‘taking things slow’ because I know when someone says they have feelings and want more during a busy period of life it can be a bit overwhelming?

Advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)",dating

3101,Advice/Suggestion Needed,"Met a girl, became best friends for approximately 3 to 4 months, then revealed our feelings to each other and fell in love.
Became her first boyfriend, and she is like conservative in relationship matters, as she told me that we should take things slowly, to which I agreed. Things don't feel like we are in a relationship because we don't hug outside my room or hold hands outside we only higs & kiss in my room only.  Feels like we're pretending to be friends outside, but via the phone and late-night phone calls, she intensifies her affections for me, but not physically.  

I always make plans and put forth effort to elevate situations, from friendships to relationships, so that it appears as though I am making every effort. She accepted my invitation to snuggle in my room once, so I suggested that we do it again two or three more times. However, she has not yet accepted my suggestion, and I am concerned about it.

3102,I am torn. I want to have a relationship but at the same time I don't because the last date I had didn't went well. Any words of wisdom ?,"My last date (first date) started great but it did not last long. About 3 months in and she decided she didn't feel a connection and our personalities just didn't jive is what she said. I accepted it what else can I do. Now I am torn. 

Why did it even last for 3 months if she didn't feel a connection. It is either I said something or she it just went downhill. Like she just lost interest. Either I did something or didn't do something.  Both are extremely bad because if I didn't do something then was I that boring to be with. If I did do something, I don't know exactly what. I have my theories but was it that bad ? Still I said it and turned her off. Either way I wasn't aware and what if I do it again on the next one. I will just fall in the same situation.

At the same time I want one because I did not know it would last that long. I did not have high hopes that she would start to give me a chance or whatever. Weighing the pros and cons I am more inclined to not try again and just not look for another one. Maybe I am just not fit to be in a relationship because maybe there is something in me that would just start of great but someone would always find what's wrong with me or I would do something I am unaware of that's he didn't like.

I want words of wisdom or advice. I want to stay positive but I don't want it to be a toxic positivity where I would try and give it a chance again knowing something is wrong with me that people just don't like. I have a few hunches and working on it but I it's not being rude or anything. Maybe confidence self esteem I don't talk too much I am not interesting enough or just plain boring no matter how hard I try. Am trying to work on them but I am not even sure if I will succeed in working those areas",dating
3103,Stood up on a first date by someone I’ve been friends with for years. How can I overcome this?,"This is long but I’d sincerely appreciate your opinion: I’ve (25f) known this guy (25m) for quite a few years now. It’s inevitable that we were attracted to each other, but have always stayed friends.
Recently I’ve become single and we’ve started flirting A LOT in person and over the phone. Even a bit handsy in private, but nothing I would consider sexual - purely playful and innocent. He asked me on a date and I went ahead and said why not. 

My friends and I happened to have plans to be at the same place he was hanging out at the night before. He told me to come meet him and his friends there after my dinner plans, but I was already going with friends. It was a bit awkward because it was so public and all of our friends were around. I think it was different because we had been flirting so heavily in our latest interactions, that we didn’t know what was appropriate. (He lives in another city, but he visits often to see his family and friends and I saw him in his a few weeks prior. Aside from him him hinting to my friends that he’s into me, we’ve been pretty discrete and platonic in public). 

That night he told me how excited he was for our date the next evening and once I left he asked me repeatedly where I went or what I was doing as the night went on. Later on he ended up getting an Uber to my place and we both folded. It was great. I don’t think I’m completely in the wrong for caving in because over the last month and a half, tension had risen. I knew I wasn’t ready in the 3 opportunities we had before and honestly wanted to know if he thought I was “good enough” to try to court me before getting THAT deep. I had this odd feeling that I wouldn’t hear from him once he left although it was a great night and morning. He asked and planned the date so I didn’t feel responsible for reaching out about the plans ahead (I’m new to this). 

He consistently posted online while hanging out with his guy friends all day - to which I avoided watching simply because I didn’t want to fixate on thinking that he would not show. The movie was for 10:30PM. When I hadn’t heard from him all day, by 9:45PM I decided that it was best for me to make other plans to get my mind off of it. 

He finally reached out today saying he’s “bummed we didn’t get to see the movie”. He told me he went to a “birthday thing”, but I’m more disappointed that he didn’t let me know the day of or let me know that he was no longer interested in me. I also just can’t believe it took him 2 full days to say anything. I’m a bit vulnerable right now because I just got out of a relationship and just wanted to have fun and thought since we had been friends for so long that it would still be playful and not feel like too much pressure since I’m jumping back in the dating pool. 

I feel like I have the right to be upset, but I don’t want to give him the power of knowing that it hurt my feelings or made me feel like just an option. It kind of hurts more than any other flings in the past because we do have good memories prior to this fling and I most likely lost a good friend because of this. I feel a little used or like a challenge that he won after years of trying to pursue me (I only know this because he has been open in the past about wanting me). 

Thoughts on how I should move on or move forward? Would it be wise to just ghost him for good or at least remain cordial with him? I’d like to think I’m overall pretty reasonable and would have been bummed but understood if he did cancel. I’m also completely aware that this might have just been a 5 year mission to get into my pants, but I’m more upset about the date rather than my lack of self control the night before. After not hearing anything at all, I think deep down I’ll always be a little bitter and feel like he didn’t think I deserved it after giving it up. I know quite a bit about his dating life from what he’s shared with me, so I do feel left out that I haven’t gotten to see that side of him. 

This guy has told me things like “I want to put babies in you, they’d be so cute”, “my mom has wanted to meet you for years”, “you’ve always been my ‘what if’ girl” which could have been crap LOL, but I hope it at least gives you some insight on why I’m like -what-the-f-happened-

A part of me is also wondering that by his message today, maybe he felt our plan was off since we spent the night together.",dating
3104,Is there something wrong with me?,"In my circles of friends, my social circles and so on, I have always, through my entire life (30 yo m)), had absolutely zero luck with attracting members of the opposite sex that I'm attracted to. I'm a large dude but not overweight, I'm generally a kind person, and I speak well enough. Whether I groom myself or not, no matter how extraverted or introverted I behave at any given time, and no matter how social I am I don't seem to have ever gotten a date with a person I'm attracted to.

I'm a piano player and have a bachelor's degree in philosophy which I don't flaunt but I do enjoy talking to people and hang out with musicians, go to parties and bars sometimes, etc. Most of my lifetime I've just accepted the fact that I can't get what I want out of life and that life will always be this obnoxious drudgery with no silver lining, but recently it's been getting to me. I want to be capable of going out on casual dates and find some reasonably attractive (for me) female partners, but it's like it's impossible. No matter what.

Online dating doesn't work either - I'll have some great conversation and click with another person on Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Okcupid, or similar, and then ask the person out or sometimes not even that, and just get blocked with zero response whatsoever.

Meanwhile my male friends and female friends will get dates just like a snap of the fingers, attract exactly whatever they seem to say that they want within a couple of weeks, and get to have sex and intimacy or long term relationships or whatever it is that they want with very little effort. I remember reading way back about this something like ""Some people just have more sex and some people don't, and it's okay either way,"" but it's like I'm one of those that has less sex and it's not okay with me. I exercise and pay attention to my diet, but I don't have any legitimate ideas as to get better at performing in this part of my life than that.

Meanwhile women will walk up to me and tell me that I'm attractive but will out of completely nowhere just remove me from their lives. No reason, no conflict, no racy things said at all, etc. 

Generally I have some facial hair but whether or not I'm grooming myself regularly doesn't appear to matter. Maybe I'm too masculine or something? 

How do I go about finding partners without failing almost every single time? I'm starting to become seriously clinically depressed about this. I don't know, it's just like I was constructed to participate in a life where everything looks at me in some sort of Kafkaesque situation - like I have zero game, but I want more. IDK. It feels childish to say this but I'm starting to get jealous of people over it. I'll even spend time with women who are dating literal abusers, or hang out with male friends who can talk about nothing except the desire to unalive themselves (which I of course talk them out of) and still they attract women romantically, like they're just pressing a button and intimate partners show up.

Like I feel like in my past relationships I should have just taken every opportunity to cheat on my significant others because while I don't do that, I don't try to manipulate women into having sex with me, and so on, the people I know who get to have intimacy with women do those things.

I kind of hate my own existence now, and relish the idea that eventually this horrible life will end. So IDK.",dating
3105,I gave my number to the waitress and now my heart sores,"Why, just why. 

I’ve (M28) been going to this place from time to time and noticed a waitress that picked my interest. One day, as our gazes meet yet once more and even smiled, I decide to give her my number. 

A few days go one and I receive messages from her (silly me thought it was over by then), we exchange a bit and I suggest to go for a drink (to which she says « yes with pleasure »). We arrange a meeting later the following week, which was last Friday, yet because of the rain she invites me to join her and her friends somewhere else, to which I was reluctant to do (didn’t know either of them). 
At some point I say that I might leave if she’d rather stay with her friends, she decides for only the two of us to have a drink which opened up the door to the best date I ever had. Like, seriously. I met her kind friends asking how it was going between us (I do discover that she’s actually 19, which doesn’t bother much but could explain some things), and we spent practically the whole evening close to each other, laughing and reciprocating what felt like the beginnings of a wonderful relationship with all that we shared.

The night draws on, and after a very suggestive look she casts at me with her blushed lips I venture and lean in for a reciprocated kiss (I did ask if she had a bf). We end up kissing again and again with passion through the middle of the night until our paths separated as I was taking the decently latest train.

The next day, I briefly get a drink at her place of work and I somehow felt something could be slightly off, yet she comes a few times to my table and I thought she could be tired (as she was of her work that she thought of leaving) and as I depart she says « see you soon ». 

I send her a text to ask her if she wanted us to meet in the evening, she says she’s going to a festival so it might be complicated. 
And that’s the last message she sent me since.

Uneasiness started to crawl under my skin as I sensed something.
I decided to nevertheless express how I really liked the evening we had, which was left unanswered. I ask the next day if she wants to meet the next day, left unanswered. 
That I was maybe mistaken (about the situation). Unanswered.

If she maybe wanted to talk. 

Unanswered.

It has been years since I’ve felt this way, the pain and heart sinking in and the worst of all, the absolute lack of understanding of what is going on. 
How is it possible to go from the undeniable premise of love to complete silence ?

3106,"If he regularly doesn’t reply to your texts, but has given you several heads up about it, should it be taken as a sign of disinterest or could he genuinely be that busy/bad at texting?","This guy I’ve been seeing is very inconsistent with his texting. I don’t typically hear from him much unless we’re making plans to hangout (which sometimes can take weeks), and sometimes even if/when I reach out or send something he doesn’t reply. Usually if it’s a question or something “urgent” he does get back to me in a reasonable amount of time, but if I send him photos, or reply back to something he’s asking, he doesn’t say anything further.

He has told me on several occasions, both over the phone and in person, that he isn’t big on texting so if I ever really need to reach him I should just call him and that I shouldn’t take it personally if I don’t hear from him for a while because he’s usually just busy with work or whatever else he’s doing at the time. 

I definitely appreciate the heads up, especially since we aren’t dating (so I know he doesn’t owe me anything), but sometimes I can’t help but wonder if I’m being naive and that he just says this because he isn’t interested in me but doesn’t want to hurt my feelings? I just sometimes stress myself out because the lack of a response sometimes makes me think I’ve done or said something wrong, or that he’s trying to indirectly tell me something.",dating

3117,Should I give up on this situation?,"Ok, so I (M20) work at a restaurant and I have a coworker (F19) that I really like working with, and I'm a little bit interested in. We chat at work, it seems like we have a good time together, and sometimes she stays after her shift to chat with me (I assume that's why, but of course there are tons of reasons she could be staying behind).

I got her snap a bit ago, and I've tried to keep some kind of conversation going, but twice now she's left me on opened, and I don't know what to make of it.

Here we get to me just being hyper analytical and stuff, but her snap score is around 140k, which to me, seems like she's not the kind of person that just isn't on snap a lot, but I'm not sure.

I don't want to put her in a situation where I ask her to hang out outside of work and she feels uncomfortable saying no, and so goes along with it, but I also don't know what else to do

3118,Do you usually offer alternative dates if they tell you they are busy,"Asked a girl out, she told me she was down. So gave here two days as options, only to tell me that she is busy all week long with work. I’m a believer that if a girl wants to go out with you, she would offer alternative dates herself, or make time for you (no chance she is that busy). And very obviously she shut down the whole week. 
Kinda bummed about it cause I really liked her, but I told her that it’s cool and to let me know when she is free next time. 

Did I respond correctly? Should I have tried to find other dates? I don’t wanna change my dating beliefs for a girl. But gosh I’m so close to do so.",dating
3119,Do those signs mean she is into me?,"Hi everyone, there is this girl who works as a server at a restaurant not too far away from my home, I happen to pass by her restaurant a lot because that's the only way for me to get home. I sometimes have a peak inside the restaurant just to see if she works (the restaurant has no window and seats are very close to the sidewalk), she caught my eyes several times but there was this one time we made eye contact for so long so I just smiled and looked away. 

Me and my friend go out for drink once a week but last week, because I told him that there is a server who really have my interest, he forced me to go to her restaurant and dine there. I was shy and a little bit embarrassed because I was afraid that she can see that I am interested in her (I can approach stranger but I cannot approach people who I'm interested in). We walked in and waited to be seated, she was our server that day so I was kinda chickened out, I ordered stuffs but I never directly looked into her eyes, I kept it normal, I didn't keep her away from work or talk anything besides things on the menu. 

However, my friend know that I have a huge crush on her so he was paying more attention to her. From what he saw, he said there is a high chance she is interested in me as well as she seemed to look at me very frequently, leaned very close to me when she took orders and somehow still got the wrong order (my friend jokingly said that she was nervous haha). There was this one where we wanted to go out for a smoke, so I went up to her and said ""we're just gonna go out for a smoke"" and I made a hand gesture of smoking, she heard me and replied but she was mirroring my hand gesture, the cute thing is that I am very certain that she wasn't aware of her doing it.

For the whole time we dined there, I was pretty much ignoring her and acted like I wasn't interested in her, but still at the end I tipped her 25%. She said thanks to me few times and i was done for the day. Fast forward to today (4 days after I actually met and talked to her), I was on my way to work and I saw her on her way to work as well. Again, I chose to not approach her as I didn't want to be seen as creepy or anything, I ignored her and walked pass her, however, I am certain she noticed me and was waiting for me to say something to her.

She is literally my dream girl right there, I'm afraid of missing opportunities, messing up. That's the reason why I chose to not make a move until everything is confirmed (which is very stupid). What do you guys say? Do you think i have a chance at her? (I am a good-looking guy with shy personality)

We’ve since been talking veryyyyy casually but he has hinted at wanting to see me. 

last week i sent him something on social media and in response he outright asked me if he could see me, and told me he’d be back in town the next night.

He didn’t check in that night (i didn’t either) and I didn’t hear from him all weekend. I followed up with a jokey message and he did the same, but now has now not even opened my latest response.

3132,How to end things with guy I’m seeing.,"I’ve (32F) been seeing this guy (32M) for a couple of months. We’ve been on about 6 dates but haven’t had sex yet. 

The more I’m getting to know him, the less I like him. He takes hard drugs recreationally quite frequently (like every week), which really bothers me and is a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Also, he made me feel weird for asking if he wanted to be intimate then I don’t want him sleeping with other women. 

Furthermore, I have intimacy avoidance issues so for me sex is a big deal and tomorrow we are planning on having sex and to be honest I do not want to have sex with him and I would be fine if I never see him again. 

So I want to end things before our date tomorrow. Part of me just wants to end things via text, but I don’t know if our relationship has crossed the line where that would be rude. I wouldn’t mind if someone ended dating with me over text but I can imagine my preferences are not the norm. 

So how should I end it? Is over text okay?",dating

3134,"How to initiate the ""what are we?"" conversation...","I (22F) have been talking to a guy (28) for a little over a month now, and I feel like it's kind of time for me to ask what the intent of us talking is. 

For some background, he does live 2 hours away, but we talk every day and call most nights (sometimes for up to 6 hours). I've gone there once, and he's come here two weekends in a row. He's spent the night with me the past 2 times, the first time on the couch, and this past weekend in bed with me. We go on cute little dates, and cuddled in bed, and I think there's an obvious interest, but he's not very vocal about it. He has a sort of aloof and mysterious personality, he's not big on verbally expressing his interest/giving words of affirmation, and he hasn't attempted to kiss me yet or make any sort of sexual advances (which I find a little odd). 

In the time that we've been talking, I've cut contact with any other people I had previously been talking to. I've also stopped using my dating apps. Im just not really interested in anyone else anymore. But I don't want to get too invested in this guy if he isn't interested in anything more than what we've been doing (physically or emotionally). 

How do I start the conversation of ""what is this, and where is it going?"" without coming on too strong or scaring him off. I'm enjoying what we have now, but I don't want to put my all into it if it's not going anywhere further.

She doesn’t post on socials very often, and I feel like messaging out of the blue is a bit sudden and strange, I’m 21 as is she, so it’s just not something which, I personally believe, happens much at that age.

Here I am talking about decorations. Let’s see, oh I saw a good movie the other day. Have you seen any good movies lately?” He said “no.” He never asked me any questions. At the end of the date we hugged each other and I asked how he felt about it and he said “I feel fine but you are really socially awkward.

3142,I didn’t see that coming,"Okay… so the story goes like this. A few years ago I met this guy. I’m a female in my twenties and he is in his thirties. We met thanks to a book club. The book club was online, so the meeting were virtual and we didn’t meet face to face after a year of knowing each other.   
We started talking and we connected almost instantly. He had had his ups and downs in life and he confessed to me that he was still a virgin. We shared tough stuff about our lives so the friendship grew bigger and stronger everyday. We talk every single day, almost 24/7. At one point, we realised that the chemistry was undeniable. There was something more going on. But, in that time I was in a long- term relationship of almost 8 years. And although I wasńt in the best terms with my partner, I wanted to make it work.  
After a year, we started to hang out with the book club. We used to go out or to have dinners together. So, of course, we finally meet with this guy. And OMG the atraction was palpable. Even friends thought we were a couple. Every time he moved closer o he touch me, made me feel butterflies all over my body. He is a touchy person, you know.. the kind of people that says something and put your hand on your arms.  
But then.. almost two years after, the feeling was too obvious to hide and it was really hard to just being friends. So we decided to put a distance between us and stop talking. In that time I tried to make thing work with my boyfriend but it was a toxic relationship and I couldn’t put up with that anymore, so we broke up.  
Moving fast forward, I reconnected with this guy. He told me that he had missed me, and that it was hurtful not speaking to me. We started talking again, and the feeling was still there. As I am single, trying to learn how to be single again, we decided to take thing slow and be friend with benefits.   
Last week we decided to be together \[sexually speaking\]. I was feeling sexy, excited, I even bought the condoms. We were really nervous. Me, because only a boy had seen me naked, and him because of his lack of sexual experience. I decided to take control of the situation. We laid in bed and I told him to close his eyes and I kissed him. He started laughing. I could feel how nervous he was. How embarrassed he felt. I told him that if he felt insecure or something we could stop. I didn’t want to force him. After a few minutes, we had sex. It was a bit awkward but I don’t know.. I put on my rose coloured glasses.  
Now, it’s when everything starts to feel strange. We hang out later that evening, and we were just fine. We had fun together, he was really caring and kind. But since earlier, the connection was a little bit off. Every time I kissed him, he acted tense. He told me he didn’t feel comfortable with the kissing stuff..but he didn’t know why. He was surprised. Even disappointed. And for me..kissing is as erotic o even more erotic that the sexual stuff. The only thing he told me, it’s that he thinks that unconsciously he may be putting emotional distance because he is afraid of one of us being hurt.   
We keep talking because we’re surprised that the connection we felt and that it was so strong, doesn’t reflect on our actions.  
Since the day I met him, all I ever wanted to do is kiss him. But he told me that he never thought of that, which is kind of a bummer. We keep talking, because we are trying to find a solution o an explanation of what is going on between us.  
I’m not asking what to do.. I just wanted to share this story and I don’t know..maybe someone out there had an experience similar to mine and I wouldn’t make me feel so alone.",dating

I didn’t know if it was an accident or what, so I just continued to follow. I noticed he hadn’t posted in awhile, so I thought maybe something happened. Well, turns out he just blocked me from viewing his story (which I saw from my business page). It was a post of him and his gf / woman he’s dating I’m guessing.

I don’t get why he’d unfollow me AND block me from viewing his story. Because it seems like he wants to hide his gf, but he wouldn’t unfollow if he wanted to keep me around.

3145,Extremely Confused,"Hey y'all! 30F here! I've been seeing a 29M off and on since January of this year. 

He has been ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. But not in a BAD way - he just pops up asking to go out or hang out, we're always sending each other memes on IG, texting small talk. We work together so I see him every day, it's not awkward or anything. When we first started getting to know each other better in January, I had mentioned kids weren't something I had envisioned YET (just no right person to make me want to have children yet). That was big enough for him to say something along the lines of ""maybe this won't work, she doesn't want kids"" and he kind of backed off for a while until I was able to explain it better, and he seemed to understand but then didn't really talk to him for about a month or so...

The last few weeks though, he has been more consistent, but I can't figure him out. Our jobs are super busy, and 8-5 is reserved for work. But I feel like I've dropped a million hints for him...he's such a sweetheart, and I feel like he's nervous or scared. He'll go quiet for a few days, and then pop back up.

3149,Did I blow my (23M) chance with my cousins (26F) friend ?,"So last night I (23/M) went out to a bar with my cousin (26/F) and her friends. I go out with them occasionally for birthdays or other events but I rarely interact with her friends. 

My cousin has a friend, Megan, who she’s been friends with for basically her whole life and even my family knows who Megan is. I see her every once in awhile and last time I saw her was a year ago when she was dating some guy. 

At the bar last night we were all in a little circle and dancing and singing to the music. Probably about 6-8 of us. Megan started dancing with me and grabbing my hands while we danced and sang to different songs. I didn’t think anything of it but then eventually she asked if I wanted to get a drink at the bar and I said yes so she grabbed my hand and lead me through a crowd and to the bar and bought us a shot and beer. And then she did the same thing with my hand after we got our drinks and walked back to where everyone was. And then later we got another drink on me so I grabbed her hand and lead her to the bar and back to our circle. 

I was pretty drunk and I didn’t go into the night planning to make a move on her but after telling my friends about her grabbing my hand and stuff they said I blew my shot. I feel like an idiot now lol because I totally would have kissed her. I wasn’t sure if she was just being nice to me since she’s a good person or just trying to have fun .


TL;DR: my cousins (26/F) friend grabbed my hands to dance and to lead me (23/M) to the bar last night and I’m not sure if she was interested in me. My friend said I blew my chance. But I am unsure if grabbing my hands and dancing with me meant anything.",dating

3151,Living in a shared House a bummer? (34M),"Hello Folks

After a break up I intend to go back dating and see what comes out of it: Now I would like to have some perspective on the living situation I'm in:

I live in a quite big house (3 floors) together with two other people around my age all with normal jobs: We have each our room(s) and a big shared living room, Kitchen, Garden (with chickens), basement with much storage and a little gym, so generally a lot of place. When I moved new to the City (Central Europe) I didn't know many people and being a very social person  I decided not to go live on my own, but join this house. I like it as the people are great and we sometimes do stuff together but everyone also lives their own life and sometimes one is alone for 1-2 weeks.

Now when it comes to dating it leaves me a little insecure what people think about this ""living model"". I know it is more known while studying somewhere to have shared flats and not  normal around my age. Would you consider it a bummer or something interesting? WOuld you have concerns about privacy while dating?

It seems like many girls I meet in person or through dating apps find me boring for not drinking. I’m still a huge stoner, but there aren’t that many girls out there who use cannabis and don’t drink alcohol. And those girls who don’t drink are usually not very accepting of cannabis either. Furthermore, those women who do smoke weed don’t really like doing it as a first date and prefer to go grab a drink. And going out to bars makes me feel out of place because everyone else is drunk and I’m not. It used to be way easier for me to talk to girls at bars when I was drunk, but it seems like picking up girls outside of bars is also harder now for some reason.

Ladies: is it true that y’all would prefer a man who is willing to have a glass of wine with you, or does it not really matter if one is sober? Any dating advice for someone who is sober from alcohol but still smokes a lot of weed?",dating
3153,Lonely confused who get to discuss for the first time,"29M never had a girlfriend sound weird yes i know, in fact i've been working remote since covid in 2020 ,never had the opportunity to meet new friends ,not onto dating apps ,most of my friends left the country so i didn't develop new connectons,also never had the gut to approach to girls (lack of confidence) .

Lately my work organized an event where we are all gathered all remote employees (strategy of the company in my country to work remote) ,it's been a gathering and work together in an hotel ,in the night we went all to a restaurant where i had the opportunity to talk to many coworkers especially to a girl where we spent almost an hour talking to her it was fun she was open during our talk and smiling, playing with her hair .I kept the discussion in work topics and i enjoyed a lot .

after the gathering in the restaurant it's organized also that we go to a club next to the restaurant and it wasn't in my plan to go with them until that discussion ,so i decided to go because of her of course .  
in the club we sit together talked a bit not too much since it's noisy had the opportunity to dance with whole group of coworkers.

When we decided to leave all i proposed to ride her to the hotel since i go back to the house, in our way back I got her phone number(whatsapp) left her in the hotel entrance and she told me to text her my arriving to the house .  
by tomorrow in the hotel i talked to her not too much but with the colleagues and by the end of the event i talked to her and told her let's keep on touch ,and then the farewell

After two days I texted her few messages asking about her and telling that I enjoyed the all gathering ,the discussion and getting to know her and she texted the same and that was yesterday.

I don't know , should I ask her for a date to get to know each other more?, telling her that I'm onto her? ,should I tall her that I like her ?sooner this week or keep the discussion virtually but she's not responding by long texts.

Thanks.",dating
3154,Ex girlfriend coming back or just friends?,"Hello everyone
Me (35 yr old ) male and my ex (47 yr old) female girlfriend broke up last September! After 5 years together.
It came as a total shock,blamed myself and her going in to the menopause….
Also we work at the same place
We have both tried to move on from that moment to April of 2023.
Since May she reached out via text,We been small talk texting with each other,We then both agreed to hang out and do things together.
We’ve been for a meal out and to the coast. 
Do we think it’s just to ex partners who like each other’s company to fill the boredom? 
She’s openly admitted she’s set in her ways and said she’s not interested in the dating scene.",dating
3155,"On a bad dating app streak, need advice","For the first time, I’m actually giving dating apps a go. In the past, I’ve occasionally swiped and gone out with men who asked me out that I was interested in, and for some reason, that was always pretty successful but I was also in a different city.

I’ve been expanding outside my physical type because I’m open and trying to figure out what I want. 

Lately it seems like I’ve gone on a streak of REALLY bad dates which has never happened to me before. One was drinks and lasted under an hour, horrible conversationalist and took off without walking me home and never texted at all. Second proposed a last minute drinking date on a Friday which I should have declined but we ended up messing around. I actually liked him enough that I asked if we could try again more soberly and he said we didn’t have a “romantic connection”. Third I knew within 5 minutes that physical attraction was not there but could tell he was into me (leg touching, asked for a kiss and I said no). Afterwards, he texted saying no “romantic connection” but proposed a casual hookup/relationship. Wtf??

I’m trying to put myself out there and go on a date per week but man, does this feel like a waste of time. 

Those of you who are regularly going on dating app dates, how do you avoid burnout? How do you avoid hits to your self esteem from a bad streak of dates (or not take it personally when a bunch of people say you don’t have a “romantic connection”)?

We didn’t do anything, and I’m afraid she will stop being interested in me, because I’m not experienced and I’m a shy guy, so I didn’t do much anything as holding hands or stuff like this. If I lose her, I think I will fall in the dark, and I am afraid of this. I really want her, but I’m a coward… Do you have any advices on how to go over this block, or how to arrive to the kiss point?

3160,Dating with ADHD,"So I recently got out of a long term relationship and I’ve been dating a little. I have come to the realisation that I have no idea what I ever feel and I’ve found I only ever hyper-fixate on people and then get bored once the dopamine wears off. 

I now understand that my previous relationships were only hyper-fixations that I then got stuck in relationships with. Being a chronic people please and the hate for failure made me work so hard to keep relationships going despite never even really liking said person. 

So I’m curious, how do you actually know when you truly like someone when you have ADHD? I doubt any feelings I have now. How can you trust whether what you feel is genuine or just another hyper-fixation?

3161,Is she playing hard to get?,"Im (29M).
This girl i like (28F) I've known for 2 weeks is a collegue at work and used to be a forner classmate a decade ago. This tuesday we'll be going out for pizza between the two of us.

Right off the bat, she's flirty and touchy-feely with me the first week of knowing each other at work. Between feeling my shoulders, grabbing me by the arm and saying things to me like 'its a shame i'm not from her area' and an idea of hers was also 'to get pizza some place'.

She's also kinda shy. Doesn't do much all day appart from going out for grocerys and play videogames at home and doesn't like to go out cause she's afraid of crowds. And to be fair, i still have to get to know more of her.

Fastforward, i muster some courage and asked her what she was doing this tuesday and if she wanted pizza at a place i know, offering also to pick her up and taking her back home. She seemed happy but was also thinking about it.
After awhile she says Yes! But tells me 'no bullshit, only as friends' which is fine and wouldn't be an issue, she can have it her way.

Im a bit left confused since it was her idea but me inviting her out seems off?
Maybe she says this to make herself seem guarded. Maybe testing me also?
Only thing i can think of is to play cool and casual.

3165,Moving far away from someone I want to be with,"So I (20F) met a guy (21M) in my first year of university, towards my second year we got very close and became best friends. One night, we went out together and eventually became more than friends. We spent every day of the last 3 months together, often sleeping at each-others houses and going out together. Even though we never declared exactly what we were. We agreed in this time that it was almost exclusive so neither of us were seeing other people. He is in the year above me so it was always inevitable that we would be split at some point but at the time the distance didn’t seem too much of an issue because his home town and where I went to university was only a 1.5 hour train ride away. However, I recently got offered a job which is a further 2 hours away meaning it’s even harder for me to see him.

I’ve been finding it really hard to deal with because I think this is my person but I don’t know how to voice this to him. He is very realistic and has no intention of ever moving away from his home town. I’m afraid of us drifting apart and me losing what we once had and I can’t move on (at least not yet) because I compare everyone to him. I will be moving back to university next year so we will be less far apart, but I fear that he will find someone else in that time and that we will be reduced to just friends again.

TLDR; I met someone at university who I think is my person, but now we are moving 3.5 hours away from each other and I don’t know what to do.

I need advice on whether it’s best to just let go or hold on hope and keep trying with him to see if we eventually come together.",dating
3166,Do you know the type of relationship you want with your date right away?,"My last date kinda argued that a man decides what a woman is to him (casual/serious relationship) basically right away (first impressions) which i dont really agree to (im a man btw) since i want to know them better before making a decision.

What do you think? Do you normally know the type of relation you will have/want with the other person right away?

3167,"Boyfriend had nudes, watches porn, lies and blames everything on me","So after not dating since 2017/2018 at all, as per a post I made here months ago, I decided to take it slowly, we started off as friends introduced by a guy who was hitting on me at the time. 

We clicked on most of the things and had very similar views, so we naturally hanging out everyday started getting close to each other, plus he also helped me get a job which was in his company in the same shifts, we also lived in the same building, so naturally things happened. 

The beginning was ok, but after 1 month as he was showing me some picture on his phone, started showing a lot of reels and pictures of a certain lady, which he told me was a  childhood friend that they tried to give a go but didn't work, later on he mentions a lady cheated on him and he was sad about it and this lady was fucking another 4 to 6 guys every week at the same time as him, I asked if he used to wear condom with her, he said yes straight away. as time goes by, he does a really nice gesture and takes me on a 1 week holiday and he paid for everything, its due to my financial circumstances which were very bad at the time, due to work issue from previous job.

We are having amazing time, this is where issue start, I add his fingerprint to my phone and he does the same, one of the days I was without internet and dead phone but because he was sleeping on me, instead of going around snooping on his phone, I just wanted to see pictures as it would pass the time until he would wake up, I also see looking at pictures as not an invasion of privacy but also not considered snooping to me, I go to top of the album then I see the lady again, as I scrow slowly I see pictures he took of her breast, of her VAGINA AND ASSHOLE, 4 years AFTER they broke up, I saw everything, but there were so many naked pictures of her but also with clothes  on, he apologises and deletes it, immeadiately I wanted to break up with him but he wont let me, so we get back to the country we live in, there was a picture hanging all over his wall of a girl I dont regognise, of him squeezing her ass, huging her, I ask who is this, mind you, this is nearly 1 week after we got back, he says the same girl that had nude pictures, I lose it, he tries to hide the picture somewhere and takes it down, at this point I ask him to check his phone because I dont want to start a relationship with  someone who is not over an ex, he deletes all messages and whatsapp between them, I see a screenshot of some sex related stuff they sent to each other year before, I then also see that he paid for 4 to 5 different trips for her on his own plus hotel and everything, which he then denied saying he never paid it for her, when I get evidence he says hes sorry, I by accident catch on his phone history him watching porn everyday at work with ladies with big boobs, I had always medium boobs but I lost more than 25kg due to stressful prior work, so I am not feeling the best, when I see the porm he says I am not supposed to find out or see it, which adds on to issues we had, after that everyday I dont have sex with him but I also start arguing, because in my mind no man who doesnt like or love a woman, will not keep taking that many pictures or pay for multiple trips on his own, but he denies, he then started blaming on me everything, saying the fights are my fault not his, that I am the one who starts this issues and that I need to move on and stop, he then uses reddit to say my gilfriend founds pictures of ex on the phone, where the answer says its normal but he didnt type nude pictures of ex after 4 years, he had an ex after which there were not even 10 pictures of, he keeps telling me I need to forget about when I told him I  wanted to breakup multiple times, I dont love him as much anymore and I feel disgusted to be with him or even kiss him.

3171,What is my best course of action?,"There is someone (who will be nameless) who regularly asks me (and a friend of mine as well; as I have heard stories and been in the same room when it happens) to be in a relationship with this particular person.

For backstory, I met this person when I was about 1/2 way through high school (as I had recently changed schools, and regularly sat alone at lunch; right next to my locker [as it was at the end of the set]), as the stars seemed to align; and we hit it off as friends.
(As a note, the two of us; despite being in two different grades, we had roughly the same amount of time at high school [which is a story elsewhere for another time])
Eventually, this person asked me to be in a relationship; which (I will say was probably  the biggest red flag that I missed) stupid me jokingly said yes. As I see it now; it was more of as if a friend, best friend, and a friend with benefits came together as one than anything.
As time went on, I eventually went something like “I don’t believe this… us… will work. Maybe as friends though.” 
It was about this point when it clicked that I made the right move (but not fully realized what possibilities may land ahead), because of what happened next.

Here is some of the things done (order maybe subject to some error from memory, modifications, or from other people) after we “separated”;

- a teachers aid getting into the conversation (which I felt was absolutely unnecessary, based on the situation)

-kissing other students of 2+ years younger than myself)

-getting other students involved in trying to get us back together (which I call the KC effect, but it is another story for another time)

-the occasional message that we should be in a relationship (roughly 1-2 times a month, +/- depending on the month)

That relatively catches up with the last 3-4 years.
I have said things to the messages like I’m not interested, I found someone else (even though I didn’t, and I do see that I was a douchebag on saying it), we should meet up and talk about it face to face (although that doesn’t go anywhere),…

I have blocked the number in the past, but unblocked it a few months ago to clear up the list, and it had started again.

To be fair, blocking doesn’t do any good (as I seen), and words seem to have no effect.
Don’t get me wrong, I am looking for that special person, but I don’t believe this person is that person; especially in my vision of the short and long term future.

Is there a path that I am not seeing? 

For privacy purposes, I am not naming people, and a few select things, because of privacy and I don’t know all the details and facts.

TL;DR I know someone who has the hots for me, and has for years; but not the other way around.

What are your thoughts?","So there's this guy in my Master's program, who I sit next to he seemed nice and approachable. I approached him asking for help 'cause he was smart and kind of cute but recently I found some stuff that made me uncomfortable through texts. I am not sure if these texts are not red flags? I feel like they are and I am always on edge when I receive a text. Because I'm an obvious overthinker, I anticipate things and most of the time, they turn out to be right. I have screenshots of these red flags (?) however, it seems that I am unable to upload them here on this thread but if anyone is down to lending me a helping hand in identifying these so-called red flags, that would be great. I keep talking myself out of it, that they might not be red flags due to HIS poor English skills.

The most recent text happened last night (a message about my gender verification, which is pretty obvious that I am a woman). I keep playing it cool by placing certain emojis/stickers. But, this certain text really did bug me, because why do I need to verify anyone who I am. It's none of his business. But, I didn't want to say anything, because we will be seeing each other a lot.

He seems to have a temper problem as well. We've been partners for presentations so I can tell he gets agitated easily. I want us to just stay friends but I feel like he wants something more. He's on 2 of my social media platforms and he's very active on them, constantly messaging me. It's quite annoying. He did ask me out on a date a few weeks back, but I said no, in a very vague way, because I work after classes and because I want us to stay friends instead.

3173,What’s the right amount of effort in early stages?,"I’ve had some great conversations with some people I’ve met off apps, and I’m very straightforward and will speak my mind. 

Typically, I respond to messages as soon as I see them, so if I’m at work my replies will vary, if I’m off I might respond quickly, but if I’m training I’ll be busy. 

I feel like it’s a constant balancing act of trying to not act too interested or people will just ghost me. I have so little expectation from anyone until we actually meet and they show even that level of commitment. 

In 6months of online dating, I’ve met 2 women irl. 1 talked about herself nonstop and seemed genuinely psycho on the first date, so I quit talking to her. The 2nd wanted to come to my place and clearly just hook up even though I asked to take her to eat. She was a statue in bed and I genuinely lost interest in even having sex.

I’ve never been in a real relationship ship, and I’m also incredibly awkward with very poor social skills. I’m not good at starting conversations and sometimes I just don’t know what to say, so I start get nervous and just say nothing. He, on the other hand, loves to talk. He’ll talk about whatever is on his mind and just keep going on and on, and I honestly don’t mind it. I like hearing him speak about whatever he wants to, of course I come in with my own thoughts at times but most of the time it’s him talking and me listening. I like our dynamic, and he’s told me a few times that he doesn’t mind it either to reassure me.

However, I feel bad that I don’t contribute as much as I feel like I should. He tells me (I’m paraphrasing) “Don’t get stuck on it and don’t get held up on the awkward silences. You know I still like you because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t continue talking and hanging out with you.” And other helpful things along those lines. 

I appreciate that he tells me this, but I still want to be able to hold a conversation and contribute more despite the fact that he doesn’t mind it too much. What kind of conversations should I try to start up? How do I get myself to be less anxious? Any advice would be great.",dating
3182,GF’s mum offered to buy a house with her for us to live in. Is it a risk or should I be for it?,"I’m 30M and my GF is 28F. We’ve been dating for 2.5 years now and have been living together in a rented New Build flat for 1.5 years.

We’ve been having a few issues when discussing the topic of buying a property.

My problem: Before I moved out with her, I’ve been living with my mum previously in a council flat. Once you live there for over 15 years, you’re automatically entitled to buying it with a 127k discount. We’ve been there for 22 years. My mum is unemployed and doesn’t work anymore due to her health conditions. I’ve always had a plan to buy it at some point. Once I do, I have to own it for at least 5 years before I’m able to sell it and benefit from the discount. I can only buy it on my own as I’m working full time, and my mum isn’t. She’s happy to take herself off the tenancy so I can buy.

My GF’s problem: She’s always wanted to buy a property. The first 8 months of us being together, we nearly ended up buying a house together before I had to put my foot down and say it’s way too soon (and not even married yet!) and we should rent first - so we did.
The New Build flat we are living in now, their scheme is we have to either move out by the end of 5 years, or buy a share of 25%-75% of the flat.
The problem here is as I want to buy my mums flat, I can’t already own a home, so therefore I cannot buy both at once. Plus it would be a struggle as I don’t know if I can afford both at once.

Her problem is:

1) She keeps telling me she does not like to and does not want to continue wasting money on rent when it could be going on a mortgage

2) She’s going from full time to part time soon with her job, so wanted to try buy somewhere before her payslips shows her part time salary and she won’t be able to buy anywhere

3) She’s worried I won’t be able to pay for both

I told her to wait and stop rushing to buy now. She’s only 28. But she just has it in her head that she’s wasting money on rent and wants to buy somewhere.

Then she talks to her mum (as she always does everyday), but they spoke about this problem, and as her mum always likes to help, she offered to buy a house with my GF in both of their names, whilst I buy my mums flat, then after the 5 years when I sell my mums flat, she says she will take her name off the mortgage and put my name on. She also offered to help pay 500 a month for the mortgage too until my name goes on.

At first, before her mum suggested this, I was given advice that I should NOT buy anywhere with her as we are not even married yet and it’s too soon as we’ve only been together for 2.5 years. And I was also concerned that it could be a trap, as if we were ever to break up and we had a mortgage together, it would be so complicated. Then her mum suggesting this idea, I don’t know if I feel happy paying for their mortgage whilst I’m living there? Her mum seems genuine and wants to help out her own daughter and me as I’m her partner, but as I’m an outsider, I see it as a big risk as I’m pretty much paying for their mortgage without my name on there but I’m living there?

My GF says it’ll be good for the both of us and our future. My GF loves me and wants to be with me, so do I but I don’t feel comfortable rushing into buying. Whenever I say she should wait, she gets upset as she thinks I’m screwing her over again as she wants to buy but I keep stopping her.

She’s willing to wait to buy somewhere with her mum for 2-3 years if I could guarantee her that by then I’ll take that offer.

3189,How do I put myself out there?,"In an effort to meet new people and hopefully start dating, I know I need to put myself out there.  
  
I am 25M. I work 8 to 10 hours a day so that only leaves evenings to get out there.  
  
Mon - Bible study  
  
Tues/Thurs - Climb with friends  
  
Wed - Chores  
  
Fri - either dinner with friends at a pub (I dont drink personally) or a walk in a local nature area/park.  
  
Weekends - Im usually doing something. Skiing, climbing, going to the farmers market, I recently joined a volleyball group which I found through friends.  
  
I have also asked friends if they know of anyone but that always turns up dry so I dont ask that often.  
  
So beyond what I do, what do people mean by ""put yourself out there""? What else can I do? I am social and friendly whenever I meet people. But no one really seems to notice me, or notice that I am single. Even if I try to flirt and ask girls out. On top of that it seems that no one else is single.

3191,I want to ask out the cashier at my local goodwill but I'm terrified..,"Hi everyone, so I'll try to make this as short as possible. There's this girl that works at goodwill and for the last few months I've been developing somewhat of a crush for her. I kind of think she likes me too because there have been a few signs (but I'm not 100% sure, I could be misreading) for example: she always uses the word ""hun"" to address customers, and in fact this is how she originally addressed me the first time she checked me out. However, as of recent, she's started addressing me as ""love"" ex: ""thanks love, have a nice day"". She's called me that on more than one occasion and I've never heard her call any other customers ""love"". Another thing she did that I think is a sign she likes me is that she gave me 3 stamps on my blue card one day out of nowhere (for those of you who don't know, some Goodwill's have a thing where if you spend $10 you get a stamp on your blue card and once you get 10 stamps you get $10 off anything in the store.) Now obviously, she's not supposed to do that but she did it for me, am I misreading this? 

Anyways, I've been thinking about her a lot and the plan I've come up with is to maybe slip her a note with something along the lines of ""hey, I think you're really cute, you can text me if you'd like, my name is ***** btw"" and then put my number obviously. 

Another idea I had was to maybe wait until one of the days where she's stocking items on the shelves so that there aren't a bunch of other customers/co-workers around and maybe just be like ""hey, it's 'her name', right? I hope this isn't awkward but i think you're really cute and you seem really fun, I was wondering if maybe you'd want my number?"" 

Does this sound like a decent plan? I'm just really scared because I don't want to misread and make it awkward because I shop at this particular goodwill a lot.. also, I've never actually really asked a girl out, I've always just met women on dating apps, so I'm just really nervous but I'm afraid if I don't I'll miss my chance.

3197,Why the girls I used to date were all about upseting me when I saw them again in public?,"Didn't know where to vent. It's going to be a bit long but I'll keep my best to be short lol It is the weirdest thing that happened to me this year.

3 years ago, I used to date this girl from university(let's call her S). She lovebombed me at first and I fell for it really bad. We used to hangout and kiss and cuddle but then she would play the hot n cold. She checked all the boxes of being a narc. After a couple of months of uncertain dating, she discarded me out of blue and telling me lots of bad stuff. I found out she had returned back with her ex. It took me a lot of time to recover as everything was ruined. My self esteem, feeling blue all the time, and very bad thoughts. But I moved on nonetheless, learned a lesson and ingored her for the rest of the year.

When I got better, I met a girl at a movie event(let's call her G). Everything was going nice and dating every day. She told me she had an abusive past and wanted to take things slow. I said no problem and see where it goes without getting too attached. After a couple of weeks she began to play hot and cold and play mind games. I spoke with her that I didn't liked it and it's better to stop dating if she behaves like that. She got mad. But still tried to contact me. I sent her a final message and told her to leave me alone.

Then last year I went for a hiking 3-day trip with a group of people on the internet. When I arrived at the bus that was going to transport us, I saw S too. Still ignored. I met a nice girl during the trip and shared a few moments. S got in the middle, befriended her and was doing her best to sabotage us. She would come and knock on my hotel room's door and tell me how sorry she was. The more I ignored her the worst it got. The new girl I met just told me that she didn't want any drama and didn't talk to me again. So I said to myself to hell with it and met with S. We spent the last night together in my room and had sex. When we got back, she became too clingy and needy. She was lovebombing me all over again. Acting all nice and telling me to accept her back in my life and yadda yadda. Then she told me she was going away for a month and wait for her and not to fool around. Which was a lie because I already knew from a mutual friend that she was going away start a job with a 1 year contract. I still had some anger from the first encounter and waited for her to leave the town. I didn't want to end it face to face because I knew how crazy she would get and try to revenge. I made sure she reached on the other side of the world and called her and told her to cut every form of contact because I didn't like anything about it. And I just ghosted her, until she stopped texting me for days and gave up.

A few weeks went. I was walking down the street when I saw G right in front of me. She stopped me and hugged me. I was confused. Then she asked me for a coffe. Again, I said to myself to hell with it. We had a long conversation and she told me that she wanted to date again, but this time in a serious way. I agreed but didn't trust her. We had sex and we both enjoyed. The more times we had sex, the more she would become clingy and overracting on everything. But I could see with my eyes closed that it was all an act. I could tell that she was not only unstable but also dating other people. But still I wanted to get physical with her and do my own act. Then she blocked me out of blue. We didn't had any fight and we didn't had any slight disagreement. I laughed it off and went with my day forgetting the whole situation with her.

Forward to this week. I had been in a trip to Africa and went to Egypt to get to my plane and return back home in Europe. Out of every single country in the world, I saw S at the passport check queue at the airport. Once she saw me(we were 2m close in the line). She was with a group of friends and once she saw me she became furious. She was trash talking out loud and making sure I could hear. And making fun of me in a subtle way. She even started to talk with every other guy around and flirt with them. I was holding back my laughter because of how pathetic she looked like. But still made it through.

Today I went with a couple of my friends at a bar. Guess who was there. G! Once she saw me there, she started to talk to every other guy on the bar. She even tried to flirt with my friends but was unsuccessful. Than she tried to catch my attention but I was ignoring her all along. She came right next to me and told me that I was a bad person for not trying to reach to her, and that blocking me was to test me. I laughed and told her I dodged a bullet there and she did me a favor there. Oh boy, her face turned red and was fuming and mumbling. Then she left in a hurry.

So far it is been a really confusing week. Don't know what to expect anymore. But still I don't understand their behavior and why they had so much anger for me when they were the first to try and play me. Maybe they got hurt for not doing whatever fucked up scheme and manipulate me. But still after all this time it feels quite bizarre. My friends told me that I'm the problem for dealing with these kind of girls. And I feel bad right now for going through them again. I just want to erase them from my past like I've never met them.

3198,"Feeling a bit lost, would appreciate some advice.","Hello all, this is my first time posting here, not entirely sure what to expect.

To start, some background about me. I am a male that is currently 18 and going into my second year of college. 

Starting from about a year and half ago, I have been on a major self improvement journey. Complete diet, fitness, emotional, and mental reformation. I feel I have a very good physique, style, and I feel very well read. I am also on an entrepreneurial mission to build a product as well. 

The beginning of some of these changes were to build myself into the man I want to be, but also the man that women would want.

I have been in several relationships before, but recently it's been pretty dry, and I haven't had a solid actual partner in about 9 months.

The problem is that I feel extremely lonely romantically. I have friends that I consider to be brothers, family that I can rely on, but I long for something more.

A main challenge is that my college is a tech school that is 66% male, and most of the women there are unavailable, making things challenging. 

My main question is just where do I find women exactly? I have tried dating apps to no avail, most of the experiences from that feel shallow and the whole process feels disgusting. I also feel that most women rarely use those services anyway. I want something real and at least somewhat long term.

I would also like to find a way to practice building confidence in some form, as I think it needs work.

3205,Am I wrong to ask my BF to not discuss our relationship problems with his family?,"My (36M) BF and I (33F) had a discussion about moving forward in our relationship, which has always been rocky. It was going well until I told him that one of the requirements I have moving forward is that any issues we have with each other should be kept between us. I said that it just invites more strife and chaos when you add other people to the mix because everyone has their own opinion and if either of us feels validated by someone else's opinion it just further adds to the problem, especially if we had already come to an agreement and one of us brings it up to someone else and that person disagrees with what we agreed on. It opens up the potential for more arguments and disagreements. EX, we had come to an agreement about chores and how to best go about them. Yet he still complained to his mom about our agreement, and his mom said that what I had said was BS and that I was just being lazy. He then came home and accused me of being lazy and not doing enough (I do all of the chores by myself 99% of the time, except for laundry because i hate folding laundry so it sits in the basket for a few days) and since he worked outside of the home I shouldn't expect him to help out with chores because i'm home all day (Im a SAHM). When I talked to her about some  things that were bothering me before,  she told me that she didn't think he ever loved me, that he was only with me because of the kids, and that he had a shot at something great with his ex wife had he stayed on his meds, further adding onto insecurities I already had.
She'd basically plays both sides, and my boyfriend and I would fight about whoever  his mom agreed with was right and the other person was wrong. 
He couldn't agree to not talking to his family about our issues and said that I was trying to isolate him. 
He said that I had a therapist to talk to, saying that if he couldn't talk to his family about these things, who else was  he supposed to talk to. I told him to get a therapist. He said he didn't want a therapist. He wanted to talk to his family and that he would decide which issues he would and wouldn't talk about. I told him that I couldn't move forward then because it adds to the general distrust that we both have and that I didn't feel safe discussing anything with him because I can't be sure what he'll say to his family.
He said it wasn't fair that I had someone to talk to and that I wanted to isolate him. I told him that I wasn't isolating him, I was asking him to not talk to his family about our relationship issues, and that its different talking to a therapist because a therapist isn't going to talk shit about the other person, and they also won't talk to others about what was discussed.

In the end he said that he wasn't going to agree to my request, so I told him that that meant that there wouldn't be anymore discussions between us then because I didn't feel safe talking to him about anything going on because I don't know what he would and wouldn't tell other people.

3206,Can't really date anyone when everyone annoys me,"Title

Not really looking for advice as I know I need to just go out more and socialize, but that in of itself is largely the issue and maybe someone here has good advice. 27 M if that means anything.

I've always been like this for as long as I can remember. Whether it's due to a life long history of being treated by shit by most people throughout school life and past that or something else I'm not super sure, but in general I find trying to socialize with most people to be a chore and I'd rather just not participate. 

I've had a few relationships in the past. Anything during high school never really lasted all that long (a week at most), and everything after high school has been long distance and doomed to fail (cheated on twice but should've seen that one coming). I've had largely minimal instances of women showing interest in me, and the few instances that it has happened I was either too drunk to make an actual call on anything or I'd rather not embarrass myself assuming they were into me when they weren't.

I wouldn't say I have issues approaching women in the dating sense but it's like, for me personally, why bother when it's unlikely we have anything in common and I would just end up losing interest. I really only came to this realization recently where I've noticed that outside of a few friends I have, most people I talk to are genuinely extremely boring or genuinely awful to converse with.

The few relationships I have had I did genuinely try my hardest with as those few women I did date I did have genuine interest in and we did gel with each other quite well but it just never worked out (usually because they were cheating but again guess I should've expected that given the relationships were long distance).

To be honest with this post I sort of expect to get flamed/roasted or whatever but I genuinely can't really vent about this to friends anymore as none of them care or just tell me to go out and socialize more.",dating

 our paths and how this thing won’t work between us (mind you he is saying i love you to me since the starting) he said a lot of things like i am so done with you you need to leave even when i was trying to calm him down then i just gave up and said bye. After some time he started calling and texting me like crazy apologising and gaslighting me into not stopping him from going away even when i tried like anything. I never wanted a person who wont be scared to lose me when he is angry and can’t have a communication. He even removed me from his socials when he was angry. 
Can someone let me know if i did the right thing leaving him and properly communicating to him as to why I didn’t want a man like that?",dating
3208,27(M) & i’ve decided to give up on love.,it’s just been too exhausting finding someone and then they choose to not give the effort and just leave you in the dark. basically nothing fruitful is happening after all of this so i’m done. maybe love isn’t meant for me anyway. this sucks.,dating
3209,Any tips for building a relationship with my partner's kids?,"My partner (37M) and I (29F) have been together about 6 months at this point. We met years ago when we were both with other people. He has two daughters age 5 and 7 , and I've known them just as long as I've known him. Long story short, both of our partners cheated on us, and somehow we reconnected and ended up together.

So my question is, what's the best way to build a relationship with the kids? I always liked kids, but most of my experience with kids is with babies and toddlers, so I don't have the best grasp on how to interact with older kids. I obviously don't want to treat them like toddlers, so I'm looking for suggestions and ideas with things that I can do with them that they will enjoy. Any tips for interacting with this age group in general, activities to do, games to play, or anything else would be greatly appreciated!",dating
3210,[M24] Genetics are extremely hard to overcome for men,"Not even talking about height, facial features, deep voice, body frame, penis size or anything like that.



Personality is the real kicker honestly for dating.




I'm boring, not particularly intelligent, something is clearly wrong with my laughter as I struggle to laugh at jokes or to be funny, especially in 1 on 1 settings.

3211,Need help in understand my feelings and the situation,"
I (25F) was in a casual relationship with (29M), from beginning we were very clear about keeping casual things between us as we both weren’t each other’s type but we were attracted with each other and seemed nice to each other (more like friends) we also decided to be transparent about our feelings and if we are seeing someone or going on dates with each other. Things were great for 8-9 months until now. We used to meet couple of times in a week and I also went on few dates separately in the mean time but I never liked any of those guys so it ended up just one date with them whereas he didn’t go on any days with someone as according to him he is busy and doesn’t have much time on spare.
 But I went on more date where me and my date (let’s name him James) really hated off and I wanted to see how that goes so I asked him to stop for now as I really wanted to see where it goes with James, but unfortunately James had his own issues so after couple of dates he stopped.
So I again started talking to my casual but few times I felt he is getting jealous when the topic came up about me and James. Two months passed and one day out of nowhere he came and said let’s not continue and meet for one last time. When I asked him what happened he said things are getting intense (I still have no clue what exactly it means). I met him the next day and none of us really spoke about it and we stopped talking for next 2 weeks. (Not going to lie that time I felt like knife getting stabbed in my guts). 
But after 2 weeks he messaged me and trying to have conversation in the morning and wanted to meet me on the same day, but as I was busy I agreed on meeting him the next day. But later the evening he was very drunk and called me and we spoke for an hour and a half where he said he stopped because he was getting very attached with me and even if we decide to move forward with this we wouldn’t be able to work out as we are poles different to each other. I met him the next day and the same we didn’t talk anything about it as he wanted to sleep. I assumed he remembered our conversation and is trying to avoid it.
In the following week we were messaging and he said he is going and I am usually used to making fun of him with his age and he is not married so I asked him where are you going and that if he is getting married to which he replied yes in 3 days(of course he was messing around about the marriage) but at this point I was having mixed feelings, so I decided to confront him that if he remembers anything about what he said to me and he said yes but he also said let’s not continue. I said ok but I didn’t wanted to stop seeing him and was having mixed feelings about the entire situation as in my mind it was clear he likes me and I wasn’t sure what I feel like.
After 2-3 weeks I was in stress with my university and I was missing him as well and due to the stress I couldn’t hold back my emotions  and he is the best place for me to vent too so I messaged him. We were messaging and that time he told me he lied about the night he was drunk actually he doesn’t have any memories as he was very drunk. At this point I started feeling my anxiety has reduced a little which was there from last 2 weeks. But he also told me he is seeing someone and if everything works out well things can get serious. I again started having mixed feelings and I felt a little jealous somewhere. After that we just met once and we haven’t talked since. And I am now convinced that now he is seeing someone he won’t message me.
I need help to understand what happened that lead to all this to get a closure and what are my feelings towards him as I really feel he is my safe spot to vent and I miss him too but have to hold myself because in theory it’s over. Or am I just attached to him and it is a matter of time and I will be ok? Or is it just about me feeling him as a space spot to vent?",dating
3212,Scared to let him see what I really look like,"A little background:
I (22F) work in a salon and I am required to wear makeup every day for work. I usually end up waiting until later in the night to take it off just because I'm usually busy with errands or other things and find that it's just easier that way. Because of this, most of the pictures I have of myself are with makeup on. 

I've been talking to a guy (28) who lives about 2 hours away. We've talked every day for about a month, and met up and gone on dates twice now, which of course I wore makeup on. But today will be the first time that he's coming to see me and spending the night, and I'm so scared for him to see me when I'm all dressed down and have a bare face. I have acne scars from when I was a teenager and recently have been having some really bad break outs, so I ALSO look worse than I normally would. And to be clear, I don't think my face itself is ugly, I like my face, I just don't have very nice (some would even say bad) skin. 

So I just don't know what to do... and please no one say ""he'll like you for you!"", I know he likes my personality, it's my face that I don't want to run him off with...",dating
3213,I got ghosted - should I move on or try and talk to her again?,"She 30F had a crush on me 26M and then ghosted me?


It all starts with a mutual friend of hours who happens to work at the same company as me. Me and him aren’t super close, but we’re what you’d call great work friends. He’s my favorite coworker, I see him on the way to work as he lives a bit closer so we usually meet up and walk the final leg. A coffee buddy, but not necessarily a go out party buddy or anything like that. He’s a few years my senior and has kids and a wife putting him in a completely different stage in life. 

Anyway, the story goes that he mentioned someone who lives in my building I think he went to college with, but I get the impression it was more so a friend of his wives who also went to the same school. I had never paid attention to this girl, but seen her a few times around the high rise. You know like when you see a person and you’d recognize them, but wouldn’t do anything beyond that. I don’t recall if I ever even said hello. Again it’s one of those things, IDK why, but some people I say hello to right when I get on the elevator others I don’t. 

He mentions her and how she said “who’s that guy he’s so handsome” and said she’s been crushing on me or a secret admirer I guess you’d call it. He first told me this at the end of April. 

Well, finally I met her bumping into her I introduced myself we chatted for a couple mins and that was that. Again, a few days later I ran into her in the package room we rode the elevator up and just said hello. Not too much at all. 

I felt like after the first interaction things were good, I think she knew I’d heard obviously what my friend had said but wasn’t awkward at all. We just smiled she said her name etc. 

Next thing you know, she’s popping up everywhere on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, so a couple days after I see this I shoot her a follow request on Instagram.  I check back the next day, still on requested. Then, the following day I go back and it says follow.  WTF? Did I just get ghosted? 

Also, I shot her a funny message on our housing portal app it’s like a community app where we submit vendor tickets, pay bills, and it has everyone’s contact in there where you can DM. 

I sent one on there. A week later I’m sitting on ghosted 2x. 

Eventually I’ll have to see her again simply by chance, but I’m absolutely going to take a backseat role here — right? My friend absolutely wouldn’t send me off, but we aren’t so close that I’d bother him over this. And based on the girls friendliness etc when we first introduced, she definitely seemed interested. 

FWIW, I know she’s really close with this other girl I am friendly with who’s married. Me and this girl and sometimes her husband all keep the same schedule and she’s super friendly almost like she’s interested for her friend, if that makes sense. I haven’t seen her recently to notice any change in her attitude but will definitely be watching for it. I don’t even know her name, but we chat a lot when we run into each other. 

What do my next steps look like? It seems obvious if she was super into me she would’ve at least replied to my message? Maybe too soon for IG, but IDK the whole thing seems off… 

Honestly it won’t be awkward for me, but I feel bad if I did something that turned her away. I’m fine with just being neighbors at a distance.",dating
3214,"Hit with the ""I'll let you know"" for third date after date was ""rescheduled"" due to bad situation. How should I move forward?","How to move forward with this?

  
So me and this girl go to same college or did as I am transferring now. We knew of eachother for almost 8 months but never got really close despite hanging within a group of friends a couple of times. I had not seen her in a few months but run into eachother last day of semester. We talked hanged out that day and continued to text over the next week. I ask her out and she agrees.

  
First Date goes amazing. One more week of texting and second date happens, goes okay not as good as first though. Both lasted around 5 hours with multiple places included. We plan our third date for Yesterday and continue texting throughout the week leading up to the date. This texting she seems way more into it and enthusiastic than normal which was a good sign to me.

  
As you know the Canada fire happens, and NYC gets killed with smoke and makes the outside unbearable. While texting I bring up the fact of the weather as our date was for an outdoors event offer to go somewhere else or reschedule if the even is canceled. She says she’s unsure about our date tomorrow because of the weather and we agree to check tomorrow how it is. So tomorrow happens, (The day of date) and we text in the morning as usual and I ask her what she was thinking of the weather and that I could go today or wait for the weekend if she felt uncomfortable. She doesn’t respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up shortly, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she’s not free then we’ll go today and to let me know if we’re still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there.

  
Doesn’t respond until she gets off work which was around the time I was supposed to meet her, that she’s so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she’ll let me know for what day during The Weeknd. I responded with a heart reaction and to just let me know and that any day of the weekend would work. This morning we texted as usual I don't bring up the date at all but we text really chill briefly and a she seemed into it for the most part but did not mention anything however I ended it shortly.

  
At this point I am pretty sure she is not going to let me know anything. Should I just cut all contact with her? We usually daily text with me initiating it most of it? Im either thinking of texting her through the week like normal and try to set up another date. Or just stop initiating contact and in a week or so text to see her energy.",dating

Since we have started talking we have gone out 2 times and have plans on a third. We already have had conversations about previous relationships and what we are looking for in partners. We haven’t kissed or done anything else other than hug (because I didn’t want to come off as too aggressive).

3224,[27M][24F] Girlfriend Upset that I Keep Needing Reassurance? She 'cheated' a while back.,"So we've been in a relationship for 6 months. For the first month of our relationship, she was continuing to message guys and told me that she wasn't. I had a hard time getting over this but things have gotten better. A couple of weeks prior to our relationship, we were supposed to be exclusive, but she didn't keep her end of the deal

There have been various other events that have stirred up arguments, but nothing as far as full on emotional or physical cheating, that I know of.

Fast forward to today, she tells me that an ex contacted her saying he was on a live radio show. Apparently he talked about their sex life. She didn't answer the call. I tried looking the show up and I found what I thought was the episode pertaining to her. The guy had the same name as one of the guys she was snapchatting behind my back with. But it wasn't him. It just seemed odd that after all of this time he decided to contact her and go on a radio show. Apparently he reached out to other women too.?

She got defensive and was upset that I kept digging to find out what the whole thing was about. She says I'll never trust her and that she's tired of the interrogation. She said I was accusatory.

She's now left my house (she was practically here all of the time). I don't really know where she is. She says she's going to her family.

Am I the asshole in this situation? I just wanted her reassurance and her to be patient with me. Or should I just not bring this stuff up anymore.",dating

I finally left. I’m making this short but in reality these were a long excruciating 6 years, and the healing process was just as long and excruciating. I am now on a spiritual journey, and at this point in the journey I’m ready for a new beginning/fresh start, not only in my life in general but in my love life too. The part that I’m stuck in is now that I’m not being subjected to cheating in my relationship, I’m now meeting and running into people that are emotionally immature, they don’t know how to communicate clearly, or they have no concept of what a healthy relationship is. They are all around my age and it seems as though they’re mentally still at the age of 10. I’ve also tried dating older men, and I’ve quickly come to realize they they’re not much any different, they’re just as manipulative, if not, worst. I’ve come to the conclusion that’s it’s okay being alone but when I’m offered something romantic, since I’m open to receiving love, I take it and it still seems to be the same exact problem.

He rescheduled and were supposed to hang out next weekend. We made plans for it last night and he was really excited. He just texted me this morning and told me he forgot he had to watch his parents’ dogs that weekend as they are going out of town. I told him that I think it’s becoming too hard for us to meet up. He replied all upset saying that it’s just bad luck and he doesn’t understand why they won’t kennel the dogs. I don’t even want to reply to the text. 

Is this even worth pursuing at this point? The crazy thing is is that he’s the first guy I’ve liked in a while. We talk on the phone multiple times a week and text every day. I’m just starting to get discouraged and wondering if anything will ever come to fruition. Any advice would be appreciated!",dating
3245,"How do I (23M) break off a ""friendship"" with a girl (23F) who sends mixed signals?","I (23M) have been getting a lot of mixed signals from my friend (23F). 

The issue is that she shows all the signals of being interested in me on some days, and uninterested in other days. When we interact, it feels like we're more of a couple than friends. Our conversations are long, she shares personal details in her life, spends the most time talking to me in our friend group, asks about my future plans etc. It's hard to explain, but it's also just a feeling I think we share, like when she's smiling at me and leaning in close to talk to me. She's also the one to usually initiate contact with me and messages me first and tells her friends about things I shared with her that made her laugh or our inside jokes. What I don't understand is why she would spend all this time with me on a daily basis if she only saw me as a ""friend."" Does she actually think a single guy and a single girl in their 20s can only be friends without the potential of one catching feelings? Why isn't she spending this much time with her other girl/guy friends then? 

She goes as far as explaining to me how she doesn't know where to meet any single people and gets jealous of her friends getting engaged/married and asked if I had any friends getting engaged too or what age my friends or family usually get married. She also complained that she constantly gets hit on by guys in public. I thought she was signaling to me that she was available, but then she added she only likes tall and muscular guys. I'm 5'9 and 120lbs, so pretty slim built and not that tall. Why would she think this would be something I'd want to listen to? If she thought I was unattractive, why invest this much time with me? 

When I started showing signs of interest, she gets distant and doesn't like interacting with me. Like the times I message her first, she doesn't reply for hours even when she's online. But still she visibly looks excited when she sees me and comes up to me when we bump into each other in person, even if I saw her and intended to avoid her direction. 

Is it wrong that I want to avoid her to avoid myself getting hurt from someone who isn't consistent with their feelings for me?",dating

3248,I really want to get him a birthday gift.,I (28)F wish to get this guy (27)M I’ve been talking with a gift for his birthday. We’ve been in contact for 4 months. Taking things really slow. His birthday is in two weeks and he really enjoys elder scrolls so I was getting him something pertaining to his favorite video game and wondering if that would be alright to do. I don’t want to come across as some lovebombing crazy girl because I got him a gift too soon or something so I’m asking if 4 months is an appropriate time frame for gifting a birthday present. I haven’t bought him anything before this and he hasn’t gotten me anything besides some chipotle when we hung out so I don’t want me gifting him a birthday present to seem a bit too much and scare him off because I really really like this guy lol,dating
3249,"My (27M) girlfriend (33F) was cheated on by her two exes and has a lot of trauma. She is constantly paranoid that I will cheat on her, and I don’t know how to handle this any longer.","I (27M) have been dating my girlfriend (33F) for over a year now. She was cheated on by her past two exes as well as physically abused, and she has a lot of trauma from that. 

I work retail part time for the insurance benefits, and I’m a handyman as well. I interact with a wide variety of people on a daily basis during my work day including women. Any time I even mention that I had a job for the day involving any client who is a woman, my girlfriend will tense up. As a handyman, I deal with a massive number of difficult/stressful clients, so when I have a positive day with a respectful client, I’ll often tell my girlfriend about my day. It has gotten to the point where if I even tell my girlfriend about a positive interaction I had with any female client, she’ll often respond with “should I be worried”? 

Additionally, I have braces and am undergoing orthodontic treatment, so I’ll often take my toothbrush to work with me during the day so that I can brush any food particles out of my braces before I deal with clients. My girlfriend has begun making that an issue recently saying it concerns her that I’m taking my toothbrush with me because she’s scared that I’m staying at some other woman’s house and taking my toothbrush with me even though I’m home every single night with my girlfriend and never stay out late or sleep over anywhere else. 

Last night, I was sending a text to my mom with my girlfriend laying next to me in bed. I sent a laughing emoji in response to something my mom had sent me. When I finished texting my mom, my girlfriend stated that she was concerned that she saw a kissing emoji, a heart emoji, and a smiling devil face emoji in my “recently used emojis” on the Apple keyboard. She claimed that I never send her those emojis, and that she was suspicious I was sending them to other women. I literally handed her my phone at that point and told her she could search through my photos, text messages, emails, etc…  to her hearts content. She refused the offer, so I then searched the exact “romantic emojis” in my text chats that she was referring to. Lo and behold, I had sent every one of those emojis to her in the last month, and they didn’t pop up in my texts to anyone else. At this point, she broke down crying and apologized profusely and said she knows that I’m not a cheater and she’s just so paranoid of losing me to cheating because of all her past trauma. 

I’ve been extremely patient with her up until this point in our relationship and I’ve tried extremely hard for the past year to help her with her trauma, but this is beginning to wear on me. I work two very stressful jobs and I have a chronic autoimmune disease that has wreaked havoc on my life for the last 9 years. I’ve never cheated on anyone in my life, and she has even admitted repeatedly that she is being paranoid and looking for the smallest red flags she can find even a year into the relationship despite the fact that I’m not exhibiting any of the typical cheating behaviors she has seen in past partners. 

I love this woman dearly, but I’m not sure at this point that it is healthy for me to continue seeing her any longer because I simply can’t handle her paranoia and trauma. I’m worried that breaking up with her will send her into a total mental spiral, so I just don’t know what to do. Can anyone give me some input on whether I should try to work through this with her or whether it’s time for me to leave?",dating

3252,Boyfriend (20m) working out with another girl,"Hi everyone. I'm a 20f and my boyfriend is a 20m , we met in college and have been dating for 4 months now. My boyfriend is in a different city than me his summer internship. He met this girl at work and they started playing tennis ( he loves tennis and wanted to play with someone for the summer ). I had no problem with it, even encouraged it and was so happy that he was able to find someone to play with him. Then out of nowhere one day he says he's getting picked up to go to the gym with her, which he has never mentioned to me before (he only said they would play tennis). But he says that they workout every morning together and that he leads the workout and they do it. He says he only goes with her because it is convenient for him to be able to get a ride from her. It is a 5 minute walk from his house, I'm not kidding when I say 5 minutes. I tried to just not think about it and be okay with it but he said to me that she doesn't want to go to the gym tomorrow morning so now he isn't going to go, which just doesn't sound right to me. She has a boyfriend and I know how much he loves me and that he wouldn't cheat, but I don't feel right about this. I don't want to tell him to stop working out with her, but honestly it hurts and makes me upset, and I told him I'm upset about it, and all he did was tell me how much he loves me and how he would never cheat on me and that he just goes with her out of convenience. But, I know that he would be so hurt if I did this to him. I don't know what to do or if I'm just being overly sensitive and jealous, but I don't like this at all. Looking for advice.",dating

3257,I don't know how to go about dating anymore to suit my needs.,"I'm writing this up shortly after cutting things off with someone that I started talking to on a dating app. I'm 24 and a guy and so far I've been in roughly 5-6 relationships, some more serious than others, half of those being long distance, and one of those long distances ended up matching up in person, that one being my last one. It was my longest relationship yet, my most meaningful one, and one that I'm still in the process of getting over even though it's been almost 2 years since it ended (I'm like 85% there, plus it wasn't a toxic relationship or anything, just a lot of bad timing and things not being able to work out). I am kinda stuck in the mentality that she was the one and i won't find anyone else that checks all the boxes like her, but that's not what I'm here for.

After meeting up with her I realized that a physical connection and touch is is very important to me, so I decided that I would try my best and steer away from super long distance again, but I am open to it. I decided that I would go ahead and download some apps and so I did. They are not for me. I am not photogenic at all so I don't have any good pics to represent myself, most of the girls I see are just really not my type, and it just doesn't not feel natural to me. I'm the type that needs to become friends with someone before feeling like I can commit to them that way. Just going into things and going on dates after a week does not feel right to me, plus I don't like how dating and sex are almost always going to be in the back of both of our heads in every interaction. That's what happened with me and the last girl I matched with. I wanted to get to know her, she said no sexual questions. I asked about a first date, she said she hoped I wasn't planning on sleeping with her cause she doesn't put out easily. She made some comments about herself regarding intimate things, I simply repeated what she said, and it made me look like I was being too sexual around her. I'm not saying feeling this way is bad, but when that becomes the basis of my initial conversations with someone I can't help but feel it's all being forced. I ended up deleting all my dating apps because of her helping me realize apps just isn't the way for me. 
 
So what about just talking to people in person? I am way, way to introverted to do that. I don't know if I'd consider myself antisocial, I can talk if needed to, but that's really about it. During college I spoke to almost no one, I saw that as just a place I went to so I could get my degree, at my previous job I only spoke to one person and they were the ones to initiate conversation, and at my current job I'm the same way, I'm here to make a living not to make friends. Now if I'm talking to people online it's different, maybe it's because online is where I go for fun and to relax, so talking is easier, but even then I can be closed off. There are lots of instances in which I've done things, even around people with similar interests to me, send I just really don't talk. I know this is just something I need to work on, but I seriously have no idea how to do it. Hearing people say ""just start talking to people"" doesn't help cause I literally just don't know how with making it feel comfortable and natural. I'm the type that needs to be brought into a conversation.

I have things going for me that I know girls are into. I have passions I know people would be into, I have ambitions, I know I'm easy to talk to and supportive, I thunk I'm an alright looking person, I have height to me, I've been complemented on my voice and other things that I don't really ever understand but I'll take it as I can, I've been told by girls that they're surprised I'm not in a relationship. It's all there but I just really don't know what to do at this point.",dating

Sometimes people change their minds over time too. Something they thought they liked they learned they didn’t. BE YOU and find someone who likes you AS YOU ARE.

Is it worth saving and what went wrong?","So I've known this coworker girl for almost 3 years now. She was in the same department as me, I was attracted to her after a couple weeks. She is very beautiful and shy, we started talking a lot during our days at work. 1 year in, she switched departments and that made me chase her and get her number, we would chat at work still just less frequently and would text every so often too. I finally asked her out after doing this for 4 months. I found out she had a big crush on me too. Best feeling ever!

We started dating at that point, about once a week we would go out. But we never felt like a team. I never got the sense that I was her main priority, she would always spend time with her family which didn't leave a lot of room for me. I still made her very happy in the beginning but her feelings never formed and I wonder if that had something to do with it.

We've been dating for over a year now and it just seems like she has given up on me entirely. She craves romance but all I did was treat her with respect and love. The way she looked at me before is almost gone, I can't even make her blush anymore. She had strong romantic interest in me at work, but everytime we discuss where it went, it can't be explained. She is still very nice and sweet to me and enjoys my company but her romantic feelings aren't there anymore. Her whole family likes me BTW and say how good I am for her, they even confirmed she had a massive crush on me. But something in her eyes is still missing. 

Is this worth saving and can 2 people with mutual crush really not form a connection even though they had butteflies at work? I'm so confused and don't know what to do. I feel like there is potential for us if only she showed a little more effort.",dating
3270,Why pursue something if you know it won’t work ?,"I recently decided I wanted to start dating again after 5 years of being single. I am bisexual but have only had girlfriends. I’ve messed around with guys but have never really liked one to the point where I actually pursued something with them. I met this man about 3 weeks ago and I really liked him or I guess you could say was infatuated with him. I know it might not seem long to some people but we had great chemistry and amazing sex. We started spending a lot of time together after hanging out for the first time, too. It was actually him who was more persistent in pursuing something “deeper” and was letting me know consistently that he takes who he wants very seriously. He even said at one point he felt he liked me more than I liked him but I was just getting a feel for him to be honest but I did like him. We were very open and honest about our feelings and wants  and we both expressed that we haven’t felt the way we felt for each other towards anyone before. We both agreed the organic connection could be better conversation wise but also agreed it would come with time. Last night he told me he was scared because this feeling he was feeling was new for him but he felt like he met his match and talked as if he wanted us to be more serious. He ended up staying the night and we talked about hanging out later on this evening. Before he left we had sex and when he was leaving he kept stopping to kiss me. About an hour ago, he messaged me, while I’m at work by the way, and told me he doesn’t think it’s going to work out because we don’t “connect as good as he envisioned” based on “who he is and what he’s willing to compromise.” And that “he doesn’t want to be forced into uncomfortable situations.” In response I said “hmm okay.” After I got off I sent him a message pretty much saying that I was a little thrown off and wondered why he chose to communicate those things via text and how he could be compromising himself when it’s only been 3 weeks. I wished him well and blocked him but I’m honestly in my feelings about it. I mean I kept my guard up to an extent because we were still getting to know each other and I know people are fickle but damn. I questioned if he may have been the one. I really want to tell him to take a bow because he put on quite the act lmao. This dating this is somewhat new for me so I’m definitely in my feelings and left wondering why….",dating
3271,(22M) Ghosted. This is wearing on my mental health,"I met her on last Saturday at early hours at a bar. She’s a quiet, sweet type, not drawing too much attention to herself. Neither of us had really any amount of alcohol at this hour.  
  
I start talking to her, she seemed a little on edge at first but loosened up, and after speaking lightheartedly for 10 minutes or so, I say “can I ask for you number?” She agrees happily and we start texting.  
  
Our texting was very full. Anything but dry. We found out we had a lot in common between music, instruments, fathers, lifestyle etc. on Wednesday we were on the phone for three hours. She said she was nervous at first but by the end of it she was even more excited to see me.  
  
During this call we basically dropped green flags to each other. She told me “I’ve always had a thing for Italians”, “you’ve got a good head on your shoulders” (after a little bit of career talk), and “I’m happy you know how to communicate”. 
  
Yesterday, we met up. And it went as good as you can imagine. We took a nice walk around town, talking and talking, letter her babble on bc she gets passionate. We then stopped at a restaurant, which was not planned, and had dinner together (I paid $90).  
  
After dinner, she said “I have to get ready to go bc my dad is home blah blah.” Told her it was no problem.  
  
We hugged goodbye… and that’s it. No responses from her when I said I got home and thanking her for coming out with me.  
  
  
I want to make this clear, I try to be very surface level on dates like this. I don’t put my hands on her, I don’t overly flirt and comment on her attributes, I always let them talk and let the date be about them. I’m not trying to bs anybody.  
  
So this is wearing on my mental health because this is not the first time this has happened. I’m starting to develop these trust issues where I can never get involved with anyone.   
Why get involved if people are going to like to my face for 2 hours, take a free meal, and never talk to me again? After 5 days of consistently communicating and doing what I can to get to know her? I can get over the money, and I could get over the person if they just told me upfront that it wasn’t what they wanted it to be. But this lack of closure and the lie all night just eats me alive. I doubt my confidence, my image, my looks, my job… everything goes into doubt and anxiety… all from a very average woman.
  
This use to happen all the time on dating apps. I have this anxiety now if I don’t get texts back within like two or three hours. I’m starting to assume I’m getting ghosted and feeling like I’m getting walked on before it even happens. That doubt that I mentioned before starts spooling up until I get a text back or give up. I can’t keep up this path forever and like most people I just want some love. I’m a good person. I don’t deserve this from people.",dating

3273,Should I be honest and tell her that is the first date I've ever had?,"Yeah, so the dating world is 100% new to me. I have been platonic friends with girls before, but I never pursued them romantically and had no desire to... until now at 25 years old. I know it shouldn't *feel* embarrassing, but nonetheless, I am embarrassed that I have no dating experience. 

Now I find myself totally crushing on this girl and I'm confident she will go on a date with me, but the problem is that I don't know what to do. I know movies are a no-go, since you aren't able to talk, but then it branches from there. Do I invite her out to eat? Do we go to an arcade? Do we just walk around in houston? I am the most lost person ever when it comes to this department. 

So I figured, if I don't know what to do, maybe I should be honest and tell her that she is my first fate and I don't know what to do. From what I've read, it is the asker's role to plan the date, so I feel like I'd lose points if I had her choose the spots when I invited her, you know?

Her mother is happy with us dating and we talked about it. Soon I'll be traveling somewhere far and I won't get to see her. We dated 3 or 4 time though. What should I do?

3275,could need some help,"Hello

I'm 21M and I struggle in life, especially with women. It's not hard for me to get sex, but I don't want only that. I want a meaningful relationship on which my potential partner and me can build upon. 

I had the same scenario happen to me like 10 times already and my self esteem is on the lowest point ever. It's always that I get to know a wonderful woman, we hang out almost daily, then we have sex maybe once or twice. The next day/ week they always ghost me. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong and why it keeps on happening. I am in therapy because of it, but it doesn't seem to help. I am always 'nice' to women (not niceguy nice, just kind) and take time for a potential partner. I am very transparent and invite them into my life. 

Last time this happened was on my birthday. I've known the girl for 2 months, we hung out 3-4 times a week. Made out every time, escalated to foreplay etc. Then on my birthday we went playing pool, to the city and then to her place. Made out the whole night and had sex late. The next day she kissed me good bye very enthusiastically. 

Two days later I asked to hang out again. No response. found that she unfollowed me on Instagram. I knew it would happen. I am so heartbroken again.

Does somebody maybe have advice to why this keeps happening? 

Thanks very much for every input",dating

3277,35F would like to share knowledge about dating and experience here,"As a woman, I believe that everyone wants to find that special someone with whom to share the little things in life. I love reading, golf, badminton and music, and I like people who are funny, romantic, kind and caring.  
  
If you are also a single man over the age of 35 with the same hobbies as me and looking for a relaxed and romantic date, then I think we can spend that quality time together.  
  
We can go to see the natural scenery together, enjoy delicious food, play golf or badminton together, or have a concert with each other thinking about Qin rhyme. I believe that a good date is not just a time of eating, drinking and having fun, but a time when two people get to know and understand each other.

I match with a girl (note: I've only been matched where i liked first, can't say if that makes a difference)
I message her, and see the message is sent. 
She disappears from New Matches

then i wait and get notified i have an reply.

I open said notification, and either see no reply or i see ""we couldn't load this, reconnect"" and their profile seems to be completely gone.

In both cases, I am entirely unable to reopen the chat and never get to see their reply.

at first I thought maybe this is just my luck, they replied and instantly regretted. But this is a pattern, and this last girl was rly cute, so I did my best to try and guess her FB profile from what I knew and sent her a message request.

3280,How to deal if you partner picks up smoking?,"Okay some background… I was in college when I had an awesome friend group. We did everything together. We went to parties, drank, and smoked together. Eventually, the parties became too much. I felt gross partying every day and especially smelling like smoke to classes bc my friends liked Mary J. I also got tired of the people that they became. They stopped having genuine conversations with me and were to high to enjoy things that I really liked. I felt like a babysitter. I hated every second of it. I gave up that my friend group would slow down to save our friendship, so I moved on. 

Now, I’m in a relationship where my partner (M24) was in the military. I explain to him about my past experiences with people being high and that I cannot be with a stoner. Mary J should be used like alcohol, on occasion and don’t over do it. There are times to abuse it for a celebration but that’s life. I told him I’m not a babysitter. We both agreed. 

Fast forward to out of military, when military drug restrictions are lifted, he starts smoking heavily for two months because he used to in the past and want to for old times sake. I wait patiently asking to slow down here and there. After 5 months past of smoking heavy, he gets a job and must stop do to a drug test. I was happy that the phase was over until they took the drug test and he started back up again. I had brought up that I feel my boundaries aren’t being heard, and I want to talk about how communication about this isn’t working. 

We keep pushing a pin it. I get angry when I come home from long day at work and all I see is he’s high playing video games and didn’t do a single thing in the house while he called out work for the day. 

I told him that I wanted him to stop smoking for one day out of the week because he been high everyday for the last 2 months straight. I wanted him to practice self control and chose to not smoke and not just because we are out of town and he has no option but to stay sober. To him it is relaxing and calming. It makes him more of “him”. But to me, it feels like I’m being in the same spot in college where I’m babysitting. I have to drive him places bc he’s high. And everything is funny and it feels like my person is somewhere else and I’m waiting for them to come back. 

There seems to always be a reason to smoke. I gave him another 3 months to try to meet the compromise of one day a week without smoking. One day that I can have my partner be himself :) where I can plan our dates around without having to worry about him being too high. it didn’t work. 

I broke down. 

I gave him one month to get his priorities straight. I told him let’s make another compromise. He can’t make the one day thing, so I suggested not smoking until a time of day. I suggested 3pm and he said no he can go until 5pm. We agreed. This was it for me, I told him if he broke this promise then I would not be home for rest of the day if he broke it. He has been going strong so far keeping the promise. He would make comments like “it sucks being a man with rules of what I can and cannot do” occasionally. I ignored them and felt he was venting his frustration out. It’s been about a month. I finally felt like we were on a better page. Until last week. I found out he smoked at 4:55. He told me about it.

Part of me was happy he didn’t try to hid it but the other part of me is deeply upset that he broke it. Yes, it was only a little 5 mins but I have given so much patience over the years and I can’t keep sacrificing myself for his wants n needs. We aren’t even close to what I told him I was comfortable with in the beginning of our relationship. 

Instead of ignoring him for the rest of the day, I ignored him for an hour bc of the situation. I’m so hurt that he still can’t keep this compromise. Idk what to do. 

Do I keep trying? And keep biting my tongue to help work with him? Or is he using substances and I’m wasting my time ? Idk what to do",dating

3286,am i confused,"i'm in my first relationship, so idk what is really expected and a lot of the people in my life aren't really open about their relationships.  

i'm mainly wondering if i'm overthinking things, which i do have the habit of doing in general. so all of this is kind of an accumulation of things. so my boyfriend has acted kind of passive aggressive towards me and blames me for things that i think is no one/his fault. 

for example:
we were both busy the past week so it was hard to see each other. on sunday he tells me he has work and then is hanging out with his friends on monday, so i assume we can't see each other. monday comes around and he's annoyed that i didn't head over to see him bc he was free for a few hours after work. he never told me this but was like, ""you could've asked""... and there have been other situations of similar scenarios, where it's phrased as a way i was lacking. 

i also feel like the only person that has to change for the sake of our relationship. me not liking eating with people (bc I prefer the food i have at home) and my family situation (I'm not allowed to date) were kind if ignored in favor of what suited him, and my needs felt second and inconsequential because of that. 

this relationship has also been my first sexual experience. at first i wasn't sure what i was comfortable with, but i was open to trying, but certain things i was more apprehensive about (ie. receiving head) i felt coaxed into trying, and was told that, ""a lot of people enjoy it and it's fine"".

with all that context, am i weird for feeling distant and uncertain of the relationship? it just feels like i'm setting myself up for disappointment.",dating
3287,Does she like me?,Me and this girl went on two dates. We were supposed to go on a third but she started acting distant and canceled. She offered to reschedule but then canceled again. I called her out on this and she explained it was because she is going through something hard and just shuts down and can’t do anything. I told her I care about her I just thought she was rejecting me and I was fine with being friends. She said sorry she didn’t mean for me to feel rejected. She also kept saying her being distant was not fair to me and she was sorry she had a hard time taking care of herself and of friends and relationships when she is going through something. I told her no need to apologize and I would give her space. I don’t know how to feel. I’m so confused. I like her just want to know what she wants. She might be emotionally unavailable right now but I don’t get why she wouldn’t just reject me. I told her I wanted closure if she did. But she didn’t and now she’s back to not responding . I didn’t ask her out again and don’t know if I should. I honestly wouldn’t mind she seemed so interested in me in person it’s just so weird how out of nowhere this happens.

3292,Did you know that statistically it’s rare for the average male to be asked out or hit on?,"

Do you ever wonder why that is? Is it because no woman finds them attractive? I’d argue not. I’d argue that 90% of the time when a women has a crush on a guy she will show it through subtle means like eye contact or being nice rather than openly and flagrantly admitting that they are attracted to you.


If you truly believe the slogan “she’s just being nice, if she liked you then she would have let you know” and given the fact that most men aren’t being hit on or asked out then who is being hit on and asked out if most women operate this way? 

When it comes down to it, logically there’s really only two way this could go.

Either A. Women are always just being nice and most women show interest by asking out and hitting on men. That would then mean it’s just a small percentage of men that are getting hit on or asked out. Which would explain why most men don’t get hit on or asked out. 

Or 

B. Most women show interest through subtle means like ‘eye contact and being nice’ and won’t openly admit that they like you and if they are attracted to you they’ll shoot their shot in their head. Which would also explain why most men don’t get hit on or asked out.

Logically for you to truly believe the statement “she’s alway just being nice, because she’s a decent human being. If she like you then she’d have let you know” if we logically follow this train of thought with the fact that most guys don’t get asked out or hit on then you would also have to believe in the !ncel ideology that most women are after a small percentage of men.

So most likely no, girls aren’t always just being nice.",dating
3293,Why don't women ask men out as much?,"So recently made a post here and got intrigued by something that someone said ; that if I wanna date, I should ask those women out, or ask for their numbers because it's useless to think they will make the first move. 

For one thing, I know a couple of friends for whom the woman took initiative. For another, I know that that's rather a rarity than being a normal thing. 

While I support the act of taking initiative, I wonder if even in 2023, the general consensus is men should be the ones taking initiative. I think any person who puts themselves out to date should do that as a form of personal growth as it makes you put effort into the process. 

Moroever, in today's age when we are breaking all types of gender norms i.e. who will pay for dates, who will bring the main income in the family, etc, then why are we holding on to these ideas?Don't men equally deserve the special feeling of being approached/being asked out as well? In fact if they are someone who have built great value in themselves and have done well in being a desirable person.",dating

3295,Never Even Dated...,"I used to like this guy a lot. Let's call him T. I'm talking head over heel, heart eyes, constant smiles, etc. I was so down bad for him. He does wrestling and there was this wrestling tournament at my school and there was a volunteering event for that so I decided to go. Mind you, it was like a 10-12 hours event. And I still decided to go. For him. Purely. I didn't care about the hours. I didn't even care for wrestling. I went to a 10,12 hours volunteering event for him. And honestly, it paid off. We started talking after that. I don't think we'd ever start talking if I didn't go to that event and met him there. Also, I wasn't even sure if I was gonna see him there, but I did it anyway because I was that crazy for him. If you're wondering how I got to that point in the first place, the answer is I'm not sure. I talked to him once or twice in class, and I really clicked with him. Like I've never clicked with a guy like that before. So we started talking more and more, both online and in person. But then I don't remember what happened but I got bored(?) and lost interest in him. Gradually. He started getting on my nerves. Like everything he does started getting on my nerves. And I tried. I really tried to get those feelings back but it just got worse and worse. We stopped talking for a while. And finally, he said something. He texted me saying he kept waiting for me to talk to him first but I never did and he just wants to know what's going on between us. And so I broke it off. Well, we broke it off after that and never talked again. I realized that I lost interest because he wasn't the guy I thought he was when I talked to him the first few times. It wasn't in a good or bad way. He just wasn't my type, or the type of guy I was looking for anymore. This is gonna sound pretty shitty but stick with me. He was too sensitive and vulnerable, for a lack of better word. Or maybe it's my commitment issues. One time, he said happy valentine's and I didn't say it back so he called me mean and wouldn't tell me why until I forced it out of him. I was pretty stressed at that time because of some competition so I was not in the mood at all for dealing with his pettiness and childishness. I don't know if those are the right terms for it, but yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm probably the issue here, but he was in his emotions a lot. Like I said, very sensitive and vulnerable. I am very emotionally unstable and I was going through some stuff, so having a bf who's also like that just wasn't gonna work. I needed someone to be strong enough to be there for me because I really didn't have that. I didn't have that support system so I needed, or rather wanted, a guy to be that for me. So obviously, I wasn't and couldn't deal with him. I felt like I was comforting him more than he was comforting me, which sounds soooooo shitty and petty. But I wasn't, still not, in the space to be that person for him. I needed that person in him, rather than being that person for him. I felt like I was the one wearing the pants in the relationship and that was kinda a turn-off. Basically I wasn't a good fit for him, he wasn't a good fit for me. We weren't compatible. But after a while after we broke it off, I started thinking about him again. Like, I still think he's cute and I know it's normal to think your ex or the person you used to like cute still, but it's not that simple. I still think he's cute like how I used to think he was cute. He's not even my type look-wise. Even my friends say so. And the idea of him that attracted me got broken, so I don't know why I still think he's cute in that way. I don't know anymore to be honest. I'm dealing with so much stuff right now, and having this is barely anything compared to that, but I just need to stop with this. Stop liking him. I need to get over him, actually over him and move on. I haven't liked anyone else ever since after him. I tried liking this guy and I did like him somewhat but he was no doubt a rebound. I need advice on this. I feel pathetic since I was in control and I was the one who broke it off and now I'm the one still all up in my feelings. And yes, I know I have issues and I was most likely the issue. A girl told me once I should probably say sorry to him. So yes, I know, I am aware. Please give me advice on this! Any help would be appreciated!",dating
3296,an unexperienced rookie?," TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old guy who lacks dating experience. I had a conversation with a pretty girl at a reception and she mentioned turning 21.

So I haven't really been the one to initiate females for relationships over the years however i have been able to come in contact and make a couple of friends that were girls, and one faux high-school freshman year girlfriend (literally just asked her out cuz she was in my class but after that I didn't really know how to keep a convo with her) and just a couple other semi cool girls but they all just ended up flaking out after the first date. I guess after that you can tell I'm not so experienced but I guess I just wanted to know about this one situation that happened with me earlier today. Let's just say I regular this place and the reception had a circulation of different people, but I really just thought she was pretty and what not but anyways 🤷 I go up to the counter and acknowledge the other people there and ofcourse I go str8 to the pretty female that I've spoken to before but I guess she was feeling flirty or something because somehow ages came into the mix because they can see it in the kiosk system (hence me going into the reception) and she says she's turning 21 and I was like oh that's cool congratulations. I just feel like at times like that I'm lacking the sense of humor to say something like when do we celebrate or when do I pick you up. Look I'm not some old 45 year old guy on the internet who's fantasizing about dramatic situations lol 🙄 (19 btw) just wondering what she could have meant by that? I came back later on  like 30 minutes later and talked to her coworker and he's like ""no one's turning 21"" and I was like wtf... anyways what yall think 🤔 lmk pls also sorry for the long text let me know where I should post this if this isn't the right place too?",dating

I've never had an aversion towards dating, I have connections with people that I think are going to go deeper, I'm honest with people about my feelings, and have even told people that I liked them to no avail.

3299,What am I doing wrong?,"Kinda a mix of a vent and genuine questioning. TLDR at bottom. 

M24. Never been in a relationship, came close in high school but had to shut it down because I was respecting my parent's religious rules at the time. Haven't come anywhere close since then. 

I used to be really scrawny and honestly just looked ugly especially through college. Started going to the gym and now I look great, but maybe I'm biased! Used to make minimum wage, now I earn good money for my age and location. I have interests and can be great at conversation, always have been, but it seems like everyone around me is only interested in the most superficial and boring topics- so it's hard for me to invest social energy into a lot of people as an introvert. The only major drawback I see in myself is I'm pretty short, but there's not much I can do about that. I also don't drink, so that kinda limits my options for where to meet people. Other than that, I actually think I'm a genuinely cool guy. I probably give off the vibe that I'm way more confident than I actually am. 

Everyone says that these things happen naturally, but I find that pretty insulting. It insinuates that there's something naturally not okay with me. I get 0 attention from anyone of the opposite sex, like at all. I don't think there's anything wrong with my personality, because my friends gossip to me about how clueless and unaware our mutuals are with women (at least, I doubt you'd have that topic with people who were also socially inept). People ask me why I don't get a gf... They've seen me change and they've at least had decent success with women, so thanks to the homies for having faith in me.  Kinda stings when it's the 6 ft but super unconfident anxious friend who asks while being oblivious to how differently the world treats them. 

I dunno, it's just really dragging down my soul when I see everyone around me in seemingly fulfilling relationships while I'm just told, ""Keep going and work on yourself."" There is a point where things feel like it's getting too late, I want to have the butterflies for someone who reciprocates... I'm just kinda dragging my feet at life at this point, wondering if anyone would care outside my immediate family if I were to disappear (not to undermine their love, it's just not quite the same). Not suicidal, used to be before I pushed myself to improve, but I am disappointed in myself because all the things that make me interesting, nobody except older gentlemen or foreigners seem to care for. 

If anyone would like to respond with constructive criticism, advice, or even just some words of encouragement would be nice. I don't get much of those either, presumably because I give off the vibe that I'm confident or don't need them. I even look at myself in the mirror and think, ""how could *this* guy feel sorry for himself?"" But here I am, spitting into the void. ❤️ 

TLDR: Lonely dude who puts effort into self improvement but has seen few results. Doesn't know if he's holding himself back.",dating

3301,"Just need a little vent, and looking for the male perspective.","Firstly dating is rough😮‍💨. So I've gone through an abusive marriage and most the men I've been with haven't lasted long, but they were a lot like my husband. I fall quickly, in fact I'd consider dating for me less of a figuring out if I'm in love, and more like I'm in love and trying to figure out if that love is a familiar love or a romantic love. I was like that before my ex-husband, after I was very different. I was so damaged and scared to end up in such a miserable confusing place like that again that my claws were out at the slightest thing I considered less than perfectly kind. The least I can say is I knew I was not in a place to date. Fast forward to the present, and I feel back to myself again. I'm still healing, always will be because life is rough and it's highs and lows, but I guess I feel healthy enough to start dating again, because it just happened, no planning, I've just started to be open to men again. So as I mentioned before I fall instantly, now that isn't for everyone, but if I feel a connection I like to dive in and explore it. I have learned some really good methods for keeping abusive men at bay, because that seems to be what I attract. I'm very forgiving, to the point I neglect myself at times, so I think that may be a large part to me finding myself around abusers or users may be a better word. Also I don't want anyone thinking I'm a man hater, I have had my fair share of abusive female friends in my life as well. My main method is clear boundaries, men like my ex-husband will push, and poke and twist those. When I state my boundaries explicitly and they continue to disredard them it makes it easier for me to identify what's happening will lead to extreme unhappines for me. Since all my healing I'm finding my old sense of humor has come back, my joy for life and being silly, my openness, my bravery to have an opinion is back, etc. I haven't felt like this since I was a little girl, and with that has come an extreme excitement to love myself for all my flaws and strengths. I also find myself not wanting to edit myself to the ""protocol"" of dating. I don't like thinking ""oh should I have shared that?"" Because that's how I am. Thoguhts come in my head and my mouth has to spit them out. If I want a goodmorning text and haven't gotten one, I enjoy sending it because I know I would've loved it. I hate the idea that I have to ""match the pace"" of the other person. I know what I want. Now I know that means if a man isn't as inti me as I am him, that'll drive him away, but won't that happen anyway? (I should mention I also have my mom constantly saying stuff like ""why did you say that!? He's going to think....)

I just feel like that kind of thinking, got me into all the bad relationships I've had. I'd rather a guy run for the hills right away then let my ADHD romantic dreamer mind fall more and more and more until it's the ""right time"" to reveal those aspects about myself and then he runs. 

I guess I'm just feeling a little hopeless. The last three years I've been so happy alone, I had actually thought I may be alone for the rest of my life, and that was perfectly okay with me, in fact I didn't really think of it as my fate, but I was choosing that. Then dating crept its way in. I'm feeling like giving up again and choosing solitude, because of the way I fall so quickly, it hurts, and I'm pretty tired of it. And I'm not currently willing to adjust the way I am to suit dating standards. So what I'm looking for, is dating still maybe something I'm not ready for? Is this stubborness to not put on a ""dating face"" something that has to be done? Do all men pull back when they see a woman put herself out there without a second thought? Is asking a guy out on a date whenever I'm free something all men really consider too much? I mean how many people, men or women actually think ""oh I texted her last the other night, so I gotta wait."" 

For anyone that has stuck along for this whole post, you're a trooper, and thank you. Also I apologize, I'm horrible at writing my thoughts down. They're a little crazy, dosjointed, and they are still forming so it's a struggle.",dating

However, I got rejected. It has now been two weeks, and I've been trying to do all the things that people suggest: going out with friends, doing things I enjoy, and so on.

3305,Very difficult decision. Advice appreciated.,"I’ve been with this guy since I was 16, I’m 26 now he’s 27. We met in H.S, however he was not my first and I was not his. This has always been an issue with him and he would always mention I’m “not pure” and I should have waited for him. I never understood that “you should have waited for me” line but he’d throw it in my face EVERY argument amongst other put downs. Years have went on and we’ve never truly had a healthy relationship. Waves of good months come and go but it’s not consistent. My entire family hates him because of the mistreatment I’ve just accepted over the years. I’m aware now that it came down to me being codependent. I never wanted to be alone. I deal with depression and anxiety. But recently something in me has changed. I just turned 26 & my feelings / outlook have shifted so much. I’ve become very independent. I see things so differently I think I finally see my worth. I know I deserve better and staying in this broken place is hurting me. I want to be happy, I want a change. I’m so tired of the same routine, for so long it’s a cycle of the same arguments, I’m always broken and unhappy. Him and I have gotten to a point where we barely speak, we see one another once a month or every 2 months. After 10yrs of consistent of ups and downs with this person I’m beginning to wonder what would my life look like without him? Like truly all ties cut. I know in my heart he’s no good for me. It hurts me to admit that as I wish he was the one but he simply isn’t. He hurts me so much, for so long…I feel there’s been irreversible damage. As much as I’d like him to change realistically I know he won’t. I know I love him because I’ve taken this bullshit for years and I put up with a lot of pain but recently I started to ask myself why? Why am I doing this? I now analyze what he does and what he doesn’t. I feel like something is wrong with me. Am I mentally ill that I put up with this for so long? Ive made endless attempts to talk and work on us, I really think I’ve exhausted options of making it work. It’s one sided… he acts like I’m crazy and always avoid having any serious talks. He’s basically non-existent & only around when he wants to be. It hurts to admit when I think of an ideal partner, he is far from that image… ie; he never even checks on me, not even remotely concerned about me, no effort, just claims he’s “busy” running 2 freshly built companies. (Which I understand) I’ve never been clingy - I just want to feel cared about at least. For instance at least check on me, no one is busy 24hrs a day. He claims once he has his financial affairs in order he’ll be a better person. However he’s always chasing money and all the years hasn’t gotten very far. $ has always been an odd dynamic between us, he puts me down and belittles me saying I don’t make enough but I know I make more than him…. It’s odd. I’m a nurse, I do fine financially. Anyway, the “I’ll be a better man once I’m in a better position in life” makes me feel like he’s only trying to get me to hold onto hope. Why am I not good enough to love now? Why can’t you make a little time now? I’m not worthy of that? I’ve suggested taking a break and giving him his time since he claims all his focus and energy is on making $ but he refuses! Same thing happened years ago after he cheated and he refused to let me go. He stalked me for months and eventually I just gave in and returned. Nothing changed, nothing improves, I’m a broken record that has pleaded, poured my heart out, explained time and time again I’m not happy. He just avoids it, or makes me feel like I’m delusional or starts a huge argument filled with extreme put downs and very hurtful words. We won’t talk for a long time, he makes empty promises and it returns to the same routine. I’m battling what to do because I feel like I’m wasting my life. In my heart I feel like I deserve better. This cycle is so toxic and immature. He always belittles me when I explain how I believe what I deserve is better than what he gives me. My expectations have changed and now I don’t want to accept that treatment any longer. I recently expressed that I’m ready to throw in the towel for good as I’ve given him 10yrs to treat me better and he says I’m making the biggest mistake of my life. He tells me I’ll never find a love like the love I want… he says it’s impossible. Even though all I want is genuine love, someone who shows me attention, someone who is there for me, I just want mutual respect, someone who makes an effort. I don’t think I’m asking for much. His words are so sharp and they make me feel like I’m unlovable and have no hope if he’s not in my life. I don’t even want to date or look for someone I just don’t want this heartbreak anymore. If later in my life that someone comes along then great but I feel scared, I feel stupid, I feel hopeless. Do you believe people change? I don’t think he believes I’m worth changing for and that reality hurts. I’m not an idiot I think I just love too hard, forgive too often and I think the amount of pain I can endure has reached it’s limit. Please be nice…",dating
3306,She thinks she's interested in us as friends. What to do?,"I (28M) went out with a woman (F27) last Saturday for a first date. We met on hinge and had been talking on there for about a week. During the date, We went for a walk and had dinner. It was a lot of fun, we had many similar thoughts and interests. At the end of the night we hugged and exchanged numbers. 

I texted her Monday and we made plans to go rock climbing followed by dinner on Saturday. We texted a little bit on Wednesday. I'm not big on constantly being in contact with someone, especially if we just started seeing each. 

Anyway, tonight I get a text from her saying, she really enjoyed our first date and she is interested in getting to know me better but she thinks she is interested in us as friends. She still wants to go climbing on Saturday though. 

I don't know how to proceed with this. To be honest I'm not on dating apps to make friends. I want to find someone to build my life with, but I don't want to rush into something either. I understand that a friendship can lead to a relationship but I also don't want to end up in the friendzone. I'm cool with taking it slow as long as we have the same idea of where things are headed.

Sometimes he only messages me 2-3 times a day. No goodmorning and goodnights. He doesnt even ask me how was my day. There are also times that a day will pass that he will not message me.

But everytime I will say to him, “Let’s just stop this”, He doesnt want me to go or to end our connection. He told me he want me to stay. He will be extra clingy everytime I pull away. But once everything is settled and okay, he will again be inconsistent with the way he communicates with me. He will always tell me “Im sorry I was so busy yesterday/earlier” etc etc.

3315,Suddenly Uncomfortable with Commitment Despite Connecting with an Amazing Woman,"I’m in need of some guidance.

Two weeks ago, I started talking to this incredible woman. From the start, we both expressed our desires for something deeper, looking for more meaningful relationships. As we started to spend time together and get to know each other, she fell for me, and truthfully, she’s the woman I’ve always dreamed of being with.

She’s offered to give me the relationship I’ve always wanted, and everything was moving smoothly. However, quite suddenly, I’ve found myself uncomfortable with the idea of commitment. What’s particularly baffling is that she hasn’t done anything to cause this discomfort. It’s a feeling that came out of nowhere, and it’s been haunting me for the past couple of days.

We’ve been intimate on multiple occasions and I can’t help but feel a great deal of guilt. She’s made herself emotionally and physically vulnerable with me, and I can’t shake off the feeling that I’m dismissing all of it without a substantial reason.

I know the best course of action is to communicate with her about these feelings, but I’m genuinely confused about what to say, how to say it, and even when to bring it up. I care for her deeply and the last thing I want is to cause her any pain or discomfort. Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.",dating
3316,I’m afraid,"

I’m afraid i might be falling out of love




I (19m) and my gf (19 female have been dating for three months. I got out of a relationship that was traumatic to me it was my first love it’s almost been a year since that breakup. After that I became more of a jerk and an asshole I became a narcissist because I found out that I’m attractive. And my ex came back and i tried to get back again but it only got me hurt again. So I met my current gf off a dating site she’s has treated me right and treated me like I’m a person unlike my ex so we come back from a vacation after I cheated online but it wasn’t because of her I have a porn addiction and my brain need it’s dopamine im her first love. And I felt so bad after that she’s forgiven me and I’m getting treatment for my addiction but I haven’t forgive myself so we take a vacation to see if we’re still compatible and we both loved it and I loved. And I was afraid that we would go downhill after it and two days after the vacation I start taking my meds again But they’re high doses. Guanfacine 3mg, Adderall 30 mg, fluoxetine 10 mg, and quetiapine 25mg. And after that that’s when I started doubting my love. My heart said I love her and my brain was questioning it. Than the next day yesterday my heart and brain switched. But they would go back and forth saying that I love her to questioning threw the two days it’s been according. I can’t even smile or laugh at stuff that I find funny. We asks her friends and family that know about meds and they all say it’s because of my meds even both our therapist say it’s my meds. Her therapist also thinks because it’s been three months. But I think it might be more so wrote down what I think it is because of my med, ex, not forgiving myself for cheating, vacation, it’s getting serious three months, sleep 5 to 6 hours of sleep on those days. I know if I took a break I’d miss the fuck out of her. And I planned to have a movie date when she gets back from work. I took a test to “do you love your gf” and it says yes you do. I still plan to see her more cause I do the planning so I want to hear what you think it is. Edit I also did some research and it’s normal to absolutely love her and sometimes don’t.

We start talking again, about plans to go swimming in his pool and have a beer because he's moving out of town in a couple of months.

I told him I didn't care. 

We went out again to have dinner and in the conversation, he told me that he was very tired and that he had to be traveling a lot. We finished dinner and brought me home and I said goodbye and kissed him on his cheek as if I had done it with any friend. Days later he wrote me and asked me why had I kissed him like that and immediately replied that he respected if I didn't want to kiss him closer… so that made me think he was opening the door to kiss him next time.

When I confronted if she wanted to date, she said she broke up recently and needs time to start new one. I didn’t buy that bs cause when hanging out it’s me who pays for everything and it clearly felt she uses this strategy to get something.

So I backed off and I said I’m not pursuing her anymore, she acts wired and gets angry. Communication is dry, blocks and unblocks 3 times and comes back saying friendship which I didn’t encourage but just kept pushed what I want by flirting. She blocks again and says she expected friendship and I’m still talking the same like before, that’s cause that’s what I want lol. 

If she’s blocking me 3 times, I mean why does she even want to be my friend when she clearly started this whole thing the wrong way! Is it that she couldn’t find any other better guy to have a company, I’m sure it’s super easy for girls to have lots of guy friends or dates because she’s also attractive! 

I’m a unique person too, fit, got a high paying lifestyle and doing well in life who just genuinely wanted to date someone serious.

3327,NEED ADVICE - College Student,"**Hey all, I'm in a very interesting situation with a girl right now (20M and 19F in college). See below for details:**  
  
\- Friends for a few months, flirting throughout but no boundary pushes.  
  
\- Last day before I leave from college for the summer, she drunk texts me and confesses a lot of feelings. Listing all of my green flags, how I always make her laugh, how she really wants to keep getting to know me next semester, how she's so happy that she makes me happy, etc. I just said in response a few good things about her like how she makes me happy being around her and how I love her vibes. Note: I've never complimented her looks at all, no intentions, just how it was.  
  
\- During this exchange she said she wants to stay in touch over the summer. About once a week or so, I send her a snap text or video either a) responding to a story of hers in a fun, teasing way or b) just saying what's up and checking in, seeing how everything's going (no confessions or anything... just basic keeping in touch kind of stuff.  
  
\- Everytime SO FAR i do option a, she responds quickly, and its a quick, fun interaction where we get along. Everytime I do option b, she becomes more cold and less emotionally invested in the convo. Recently, I sent a small video doing option b (literally just hey whats up, lmk how things are going, I'm at work and I'll get back to you when I can) and when I responded to HER RESPONSE to that video after work (7 hours later... i genuinely couldn't get to her before then), she left me on delivered/unread for a day and a half.

He slept with someone else and kept on lying to me as I waited the whole night for his texts and calls. 

He told me his WiFi didn't work and his electricity didn't work etc as he was sleeping with that other girl. 

She already knew that he had a gf yet they both decided to go for it. 

I asked him didn't he even think of me once while touching her, he said no. 

How tf am I suppose to get over this? He says I deserve better and even cried. 

He says he loves the other girl and tht he doesn't love me anymore and he's not happy with me but tmw he will be happy with her. 

They both were doing this for 2 months and just tonight she nudged him to go and tell her the truth or else he's cheating on both of them it seems.

3335,Online dating etiquette question,"I (22m) just got started on tinder about a week ago and I’m new to the online dating world (recently got out of a 2 year relationship). I’ve had barely any luck with matches, however I did match with one girl who I really liked her profile.

I sent a message that was admittedly a bit dry. I said “Hi I’m X, you seem like a really cool person. What do you study at ___ university?”

Well, it’s been two days and she hasn’t responded. I got nothing to lose at this point and I’d honestly really like to get to know this person. Is it worth sending a follow up message to try and get her to engage? 

I feel confident about holding a conversation, talking to someone, keeping it interesting, etc., but I just didn’t know how to start. I find this person very attractive based on their profile and genuinely want to get to know them.

So my question is: Should I follow up? And if so, what would be a good way to approach it?

3337,I (33 M) am at a loss with my (27 F) girlfriend,"
I don’t know what to do with my current relationship with my gf! Please help!

Ok so, I’ve had next to No luck with women, dating apps, etc. for several years now. It was at the point where I was questioning everything. Is it how I dress? Is it my hair? Is it my face? Is it something I just can’t control? I don’t know. Point is, I never expected for anything to happen by being on any dating apps, but every six months or so I’d rejoin just to see if any new girls close to me had joined. Usually that would come up empty but, this time was different. I did match with a new girl I hadn’t seen before. And you can finish the puzzle, we hit it off, exchange numbers, met in person, met several more times, became bf and gf, and here we are. And it’s been great, really I don’t mean to undermine that. It’s just…I’m questioning having a future with her. Because as we all know, when you date someone, you aren’t just dating them, you’re entering their world, you gotta mesh well with their family and friends. I don’t mean to make myself sound easy to date, but with me that’s not so hard, I’m not a very popular guy so she’d just have to “win over” a total 4 ppl, so not much pressure there! Her on the other hand has several sisters with husbands, a mom, a dad, a step dad, step sisters, cousins, and nieces that she is very close with. So I have to win over all of them which is not hard for me, it’s just stressful knowing if I say one thing that makes them look at me weird, I could be branded bad boyfriend material by them. I know I know, what really matters is what she thinks of me, and she’s crazy about me…maybe a little too much. Like I get it! One thing we have in common is we both haven’t had much luck to so find someone lonely like you feels like two broken pieces fitting together. And it’s great, she’s great. I’m just…hesitant about moving forward due to a few things that don’t sit well with me. 1. She doesn’t share my religious beliefs and values, I don’t force religion on anyone, but it is important with me. At the time I said it wasn’t cause I was just excited to have someone to talk to finally and I thought maybe I could ease her into it, but now I’m not so sure. 2. I know my family would not like her family! With my parents, sister and brother in law who they are when they see her family smoking around their babies and dropping the f work every ten seconds, I know that within ten minutes of them meeting each other they’d grab me by the neck and drag me out telling me my relationship with this girl is over! And that’s not going to work if I ever want to get married! Our worlds have to at least tolerate each other! I know I should assume things would go this way but I know my family and I know that’s how they’d react. So it’s like we come from two different worlds. 3. I feel like we don’t have much to talk about these days. The last date we had, it felt like we covered all subjects and now we don’t have anything else to cover. I even bought us a couples game that brings up certain topics so we could talk about random things, but even then it feels like each conversation fizzles out. Again, I like this girl a lot and the last thing I want to do is hurt her. But I don’t know if I can move forward with this relationship. I’m doing this for marriage, and like I said, i know our worlds wouldn’t mesh so it feels like that’s off the table and if that’s the case, why am I doing this? I’m just scared about hurting her and her becoming suicidal cause she’s had it rough like me, but I guess I’m stronger than I give myself credit for since I’d never punish those around me by killing myself. And I’m scared that if I drag this on, it’s only going to hurt us more. I’m also scared I’ll never get another gf. I’m 33 and I’m only just now in my first serious relationship! I don’t want to die alone, but I don’t want a relationship where it feels like we settled. And by that I mean we’re both attracted to each other, but our habits, hobbies, morals, faith, and life choices are very different and neither of us will change ours for each other. So what do I do? Do I break up with her? Do I wait for her to dump me? I honestly don’t know. That’s why I’m here!",dating
3338,I'm sick and tired of trying to date,"I'm a 23 year old man, just out of college and I have been trying to date and find a girlfriend ever since I graduated high school. I've tried apps and even talked to women in person. For the most part Dating for me just feels like I am stuck in a cycle of meeting someone, talking and getting to know them, and just being led on, flaked on, ghosted or all of the above. Even women who show interest will end up flaking on me or ghosting me out of nowhere, like giving so sign that they were going to do it at all and it just happens. 

I've had girls lead me on and spend so much time on them just for them to tell me they're not looking for a relationship. It's gotten to the point I feel like everytime I'm with someone no matter how optimistic it seems I'm eventually gonna get led on, flaked on, and ghosted. I no longer get excited for dates, it's been replaced with dread that that person is just gonna blow me off. I feel like I'm putting in most of the effort all the time with these girls, I always have to initiate, make the plans and pretty much do everything, it would be nice if one of these girls would take some initiative. 

Nowadays I really can't think of anywhere to meet women in real life, I can't really approach anyone in public otherwise I'm a creep. So I feel like the only real option nowadays is online dating and don't even get me started on how much of a shit show online dating is. I'm done spending hours swiping getting barely any matches and no replies because I'm not exceptionally attractive. No one really gives a shit about you or who you are on OLD unless you're extremely attractive so the deck is completely stacked against me so fuck all that. Who I am does not translate over to a tinder profile.

I am not giving up but damn does it feel hopeless and just a losing battle. Sometimes I just feel like the universe is telling me that Im just not meant to be with anyone and that I'm doomed to be alone no matter how hard I try which feels really unfair but I'm done playing a losing game. I put in way more than I got out of it. So I am done actively looking and trying to date people, what else am I gonna do? I'm taking a passive approach where if I see someone I really want to be with or actually is interested in me and isn't gonna play games, then I'll go for it but until then I'm sticking to myself. Can anyone else relate?",dating
3339,"A girl asked I I think I'm handsome(17M, 16F)","A girl asked me just totally out of the blue today if I think I'm handsome.

I mean, I think I'm decent-looking. Not unattractive, but certainly not a model. As such, I've never been terribly vain, as I just don't think I have good enough reason to be too caught up in my looks.

I will admit that I'm a bit socially awkward. So I have to ask, when a girl asks this, does it mean much? Or is it just simple banter?

3340,Should I be more flirty on dating apps and on dates?,"For the record, I am 19m and I have just started getting into the dating game. I’ve had unprecedented success just judging from some of the experiences people have here with these apps. I feel like I am wasting away potential partners with my technique, this was just for context.

So I find that many of the girls I talk to on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge etc. kinda lose interest in me whenever I am talking. It’s just an observation but like to have conversations, not flirty ones, just conversations about life and stuff when I first start talking. I think girls are looking for more flirty conversation on those apps, is that true? And also, how can I improve on my flirting or just conversational skills in a dating setting?

Edit: also to add, should I be hooking up with more of the girls I meet? Maybe thats what they’re looking for and they get disinterested. I also talk about what I’m looking for too.",dating
3341,Overthinking or give it time,"I’ve (24 M) recently started seeing someone (22 F) we dated briefly last year, but she said she was healing over someone so it wasn’t the right time for her. We kept in touch a couple times. She eventually reached out and wanted to see me and we went out on a date. I felt some red flags, she told me she went out with some guys in the meantime, so I made it clear with her that I don’t want to be an option and I want to get your full effort since I’m gonna give it. She said she really cares about me and has a lot of respect for me, and that she isn’t talking to anyone else currently or from her past, and that I’m not just an option and she wants to give her full effort to me. We went out once and we shared a lot about each other on a  deeper level. 

It’s been a week since our last date, she seems a bit distant, not initiating conversations or asking to see me, late replies, etc. Part of me also questions our compatibility, she goes out quite a lot vs me, which is fine, but not sure if it will be a problem. I keep questioning if I seem like a loser to her and almost feel prepared for it to end eventually. I’m not sure if I should be patient, let her initiate things, or cut it off. I might be overthinking things. I’m someone that wants to talk and see someone frequently, but maybe I’m trying to rush things. Thoughts?",dating

3343,crush on my housemate,"hi reader,

I think I'm falling in love with my housemate. I (20 nonbinary) moved into this house a year ago and he (22 m) moved in 9 months ago. I've liked him since we met and we've been very slowly getting closer and growing a connection. I've never really had any dating experience-  I was going through a lot as a kid/teen and didn't have space to even think about that tbh.. I have no idea what his dating history is but he's been single since he moved in. 
I know it's a bad idea to shit where you eat and all that but i am falling for him hopelessly. and honestly it's amazing to feel this way for someone; I've never experienced it before and it feels so special. I'm terrified of change and I have no idea how to go about telling him/ letting him know. 

I have no idea if hes attracted to me, i like to think he is but i have no idea how to tell if I'm just convincing myself. he doesn't hang out with me in groups often but always pays so much attention to me when we talk and always makes me feel heard and comfortable. 

I don't really know what to do, and I can't tell my friends I'm falling in love with him because that's a step too scary 😅😅",dating

I had a great job, a house, money and a nice vehicle etc but I lost all of that due to this accident.  Fast forward to today I'm fat and soft from spending almost 3  years in a hospital bed.  I'm working hard to lose weight and get back in shape but it's hard due to major injuries and post traumatic epilepsy from the accident.

3345,Is “let’s be friends” ever really legit?,"So I (32f) have been on a few dates with 34m. The dates all went great, we had good chemistry and conversation, etc., and we ended up sleeping together on the second date which is something I never do but hey, it happens. Communication, however, has been an issue and the texting has dropped off a cliff and we haven’t scheduled another date. 

I finally brought it up and told him that it didn’t seem like he was very interested, to which he replied that he’s been really busy the last few weeks (true) but that it also seemed like I wasn’t interested either (I feel like I was just meeting his energy but fine, benefit of the doubt). I told him very directly that I was and wanted to see him again. Then I didn’t hear from him for a couple days. Sent another text basically saying “it’s clear you’re not interested, wish you had been honest, nice meeting you, good luck” and he replies (?!) apologizing and saying that it wasn’t his intention to come off that way, he feels like he doesn’t have time to date right now but would love to be friends.

Reddit, I no longer trust myself in these situations after finding out, months later, that my ex who I loved very much and who told me he was breaking up with me because he wasn’t ready for a relationship, in fact cheated on me and is now in a relationship with her. My gut instincts and intuitions can’t be trusted anymore. 

So what do I do here? Take this guy at his word that he really doesn’t have time to date right now but wants to be friends? Walk away? What does “friends” even mean, anyway? (I have asked what he means, still haven’t gotten a response). I haven’t had enough time to catch real feelings so I’m good either way to be honest, but I feel like he might be trying to let me down easy even though I gave him a clean out and frankly would have forgotten this whole thing by next week if he never responded.

3347,How do i approach a guy i previously talked to (on his concert...),"Quick storytime for context: Im gonna keep it short.. Theres a indie band in my city thats not really as famous, but i happen to find out about them a year ago.. I never listened to them that much, and i happened to think a certain band member was cute, and i havent thought of it since. My best friend approached me one day a few months ago and said she met a guy at her sisters bday party and she thought he was just my type - and it was the bandmate! I laughed about it, but two days later he popped up on my Tinder and we matched! It was a big coincidence. He texted me first saying ,,he would let me ruin his life"" (kinda cringe ik), but enough of a green light for me to let me know hes interested and we ended up texting for a week or two. The problem is i was an awful texter and afraid of rejection, while he was texting me back right away, so i ended up being dry even tho i liked him.. Its not like i was dry all the time, and it seemed like he was interested in getting to know me, as we talked about lots of topics in detail..I also was too shy to ask him for his instagram (I KNOW OKAY). One random day when i didnt text him for over 12 hours (I KNOWWWWWWWW) he ended up deleting Tinder, which bummed me out since I appeared disinterested and we had no contact after that.. I wasnt playing hard to get, I just get awkward when im texting someone i like especially if i never met them personally. I was never in a relationship and have traumatic experiences from men so my rizz game is reallyyyy bad. Im aware that men dislike mixed signals but i just couldnt help it..IM GOING TO THERAPY since so im working on my issues and im aware of all the things i did..  
  
SO OKAY.. i have found out that his band is going to perform at a club next week, and my best friend recommended that we should go.. I shall repeat that his band isnt that popular so i dont think it would be as crowded (i think?), so theres a chance he might notice me. Is this a stupid idea? Idk, i would prefer to maybe start over this time actually speaking in person and stop being so afraid to be vulnerable.. How do i even approach him? I genuienly think that we may had a connection and I had an impression of him as a nice guy, and my friends' sister who is his friend said so too.. I rarely like guys so its kind of a big deal for me and i dont want to let it go just like that..

3348,Asked to be his gf after the second date…,"I met this guy on a dating app. We hit it off hung out irl and everything was good. At the end of the night he said he definitely wanted to see more of me and get to know me etc very polite, respectful and he never made a move so green flags all around. 

The second “date” we drank, ate, all around good time. Date ends neither of us had to work so we decided to get a hotel room (told him in the beginning I’d be down but we wouldn’t be doing more than cuddling. Which is what we did and a lil making out) in the midst of making out he asked me to be his gf. That’s moving super fast obvi but I said yes cause why not we have a lot in common and since it’s so new I wouldn’t feel weird about breaking up with him if I needed to. The gf thing was kind of a red flag to me but he was still a fairly green flag in general. 

Here’s where the problem starts. The next morning we’re driving to his to get him fresh for the day as the hotel wasn’t planned but I lived close to I just went and grabbed my stuff that night. On the ride to his he gets a call from a contact called “Bae”. He obviously gets nervous and starts to explain but stops, apologizes and offers to take me home but we’re kinda far from my place and we were otw to breakfast so I tell him “we’re already here, if there’s an explanation now’s the time”. He starts to explain it’s a LDR now and things have been abusive for a while and basically she got someone to threaten him w/ a gun and he moved away to be with family. Also he didn’t expect us to hit it off blah blah and asked what he could do to fix things. I told him he could start by breaking up with her and before I could say more he picked up his phone called her and dumped her, which blew my mind. He told her he met someone new and he reminded her of “the last time” where he said “that it might be too late (for her to fix things)” -idk what he meant by last time but I’m assuming it’s the gun thing- 

After the call he explained he didn’t expect us to hit it off especially so soon and to be so taken with me (I’m paraphrasing) which I understand. The second day of knowing each other isn’t the time to be making life changing decisions - that may sound dramatic since it’s not like they were married but in any other circumstance ending a years long relationship for someone you literally just met is crazy-  

He’s already apologized in words and said he’d do anything to redeem himself. Idk how thatll go but I am curious. We have a lot in common and he’s so sweet and vocal not to mention super attractive - he’s said a few times how he thinks I’m out of his league but I really feel like he’s got it backwards. Not going to correct him but still-  idk where to go from here I feel neutral about him like I could go either way. From what I know about him he could be perfect and made a stupid mistake, but on the other hand the relationship was started on a lie and I’d hate to have gotten this warning so early in and still fall victim to cheating or worse. 

The last person I instantly hit it off with hurt me in a way I never saw coming and I’m still not over it 100% but I don’t want to judge him on someone else’s actions. 
As far as the gf thing, him calling her right then and there was super uncomfy, but I respect it and honestly it doesn’t bother me if that’s that. What’s messing with me is if he really called HER there’s been this thought in the back of my mind that he didn’t actually cut things off but I can’t tell if I’m just projecting.

3349,Should I cut him off?,"A guy from a long time ago

Hey so basically I (F18) met a guy (M20) about 3 years ago at a park and he was totally amazing (my mom LOVED him - he's tall, handsome, strong and funny) and we spent some time together but he went away (foster care) but I ran into him a couple of times and I was absolutely in love. He promised me that he'd marry me one day - the only issue is that he's now in Colorado Springs and he's in the Army and we only text (but he's so sweet an example is hetold me he can't do anything until I turn 18 like I offered him nudes and he refused) and even when I did he never asked for nudes. It's been 2-3 years and I still get flutters about him, but I have a boyfriend and I feel like I am cheating since I still talk to him. He's my dream guy, and he's so incredible (he was in foster care, homeless, still managed to graduate, he got certified in welding and now he's a medic in the U.S Army. He's also going to West Point soon since he got accepted). 

Here's the other thing that ties into the last thing. He's going to West Point and he said he can't get married or have kids for 5 years. What do I do? Do I block him?

3351,"She doesn’t want to introduce me to her friends, not until 2 years time, red flag?","I (25m) am in a relationship with this girl (27f). She’s currently in university and it’s her first year. When I asked her last month to be her bf, she said it’s ok but have to be baby steps. Like she’s wanting restrictions in the relationship like pretending to be just friends when I hangout with her and her friends. Tbh, at first it was ok but the more it goes, the more exhausting it gets to be pretending. The reason she said for why she wants it that way is because she doesn’t want her friends to know that she has a bf, because she said that her friends can easily just tell her parents that she has a bf and that her parents are so conservative enough that they don’t want their daughter to date someone she met from a dating app (yes, I met my gf in a dating app). So basically, she eventually will be introducing me to her parents as a “friend” or classmate of a friend (or something like that) and then later introduce me as her bf (so basically the “baby steps”). So she’ll be basically lying to them for a little bit until she’s ready to admit to them the truth. Then we had a talk the other day, and I kinda asked her when she plans to take a step forward. I don’t mind to wait but would be nice to know if she has any plans to move on, or if she’s just gonna keep me in the dark til we’re 60 lol. Anyways, she kinda slipped (which she never did) told me that she wants to introduce me to her friends as “friend” (not as bf even) only after her graduation in the next 2 years. I mean I don’t mind to wait, but I also don’t know if the wait will be worth it. Idk if it’s a red flag that she wants it to be the way she wants it. She always keeps on playing the card “Oh, if you’re not up to it, just let me know while it’s still early.” It’s frustrating cause I love her but why does she say this. Like why am I the one making the efforts and sacrifices but I’m feeling like she’s always taking me for granted. And like she’s always apologizing for her shortcomings. Idk if she’s the wrong here or I’m in the wrong. I’m willing to accept if I’m indeed wrong, and I’m willing to put in the work and wait if I have to. Any advice on what should I do?",dating

3354,"My daughter (26F) is dating a guy (28M) and who has a strange background, would you be concerned?","Granted my daughter is an adult and capable of dating on her own. She has a tendency to date complete assholes and her last bf put his hands on her, so I’m in protective mama-bear mode at all times.


When i looked into this new guy, i did a background check and not only is he listed on domestic violence charges, but also a felony level aggravated indecent exposure charge in 2019 that was later dismissed and sentenced to probation for regular “indecent exposure”.

I’m not quite sure what happened as police limit what information they allow me to know. Upon searching another court system, he ALSO caught two more misdemeanor charges for “indecent exposure by a sexually delinquent person” & was arrested and sentenced to probation….

…… he also has pended trial date for telephone harassment….. 


He seems like a nice guy, but his background is questionable. I’m not quite sure what indecent exposure includes, but it doesn’t sound as a simple as urinating outside (here in Michigan you only get a ticket for that)",dating
3355,I Miss Having A Relationship,"I just feel lonely. Not really in the sense of I don't have friends, although some people have been a little distant lately. I just miss affection and intimacy. Not even sex, just the feeling of having someone to hold me close or for me to hold close. But I'm so fucked in the head right now that it wouldn't be fair to put someone else through that anyway, even if I did find somebody to be with.",dating
3356,It’s okay cause it’s consensual? or do i need help because of my trauma?,"


 I am a 16 year old female and very scared to date due to  my parents having a very toxic relationship.  All due to cheating and unfaithfulness. 

As I’m getting older, i want to start dating but my problem is I don’t wanna deal with someone that’s like my parents.My mom is bi-polar and has anger issues and my dad is a narcissist.Not only are they toxic to each other, but to me as well. Most of the times they ignore the way I feel. For example when I tell me mother that she had hurt my feelings, she says “ I can say what ever the fuck I want, that’s your problem”

Unlike my other siblings, i never get in trouble. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. Two constantly gets in trouble with the law and the other doesn’t really care about anything but video games. And since im the only girl. I do most of the chores with my mom. I take care of the dogs, cook and cleans and helping my mom with errands. 
 One big thing is that  we live in Northeast Philadelphia, which is the ghetto or the hood. I always try  my hardest in school to get into college and to move out of this area and from my family.  The city is full of violence and other things like drug addiction and prostitution. I see a prostitutes and homeless people over dosing every time I go outside.
I go to very prestigious school for engineering, which is in center city.(  I got into it  for my high academic achievements)and have been a really hard worker in school so I always use the excuse that I don’t have time to date because of school and sports( Track). But in reality is I’m too scared to date.

In this day and age, I do question my sexuality from time to time, but I do know that I like men. But not so sure about women. And since I’m so scared of being cheated on I sometimes fantasize having an obsessive  stalker. I’ve been watching and listening to a lot of stalking story and a lot of them don’t end up well and a lot of them are unwanted but the reason why I want one is because having someone that’s obsessed with me, I would feel more safe being in relationship with that person.knowing that that person won’t cheat on me or leave me for someone else. But it gets more extreme. I don’t mind if that person kidnaps me or abuse me a little.  I’m fine with the typical obsessive things, like always wanting to know where I am at, tons of text messages and calls, overprotectiveness and jealousy,abuse and control. If that person is lovesick/obsessed me that’s all I want.
I don’t know if that’s okay cause it’s consensual or if i need help because of my trauma.

3357,Single Mom trying to date.,So I’m 30 F and became a single parent when my son was 4 months old and my daughter was over a year old back in 2018. Our marriage was a disaster because I found some dark secrets about him and I confronted him to see if this is true. And he was very controlling and just mentally and emotionally abused me. We got a divorce back in 2021 due to him not wanted to cooperate with me so I had to get a paid lawyer instead of getting a pro bono one. Fast forward to 2023 I want to try to date again but idk if I should again because it’s hard to get a guy that I might be interested too understand that I’m a mother first and that my son he’s special needs (autistic). Also I have a daughter who’s IQ is a 135 and also have ADHD so they both can be a handful but I love my kids very much. And they just don’t want to deal with that and I understand but I just starting to give up this whole dating process because it’s just hard. I just need some support or advice.,dating
3358,Confession,"Last year I met a man from work . We dated briefly for 3 months until one day by coincidence I saw him with his little one at shopping mall . We stood by each other and stared at each other. Later that night he texted me . I cried and felt into a severe migraine that almost killed me . This year earlier it was our last hangout it was very emotional and we made out it’s very rough . We stopped talking to each other . I moved on and met my current boyfriend from online dating app .(later I found out he’s also a kid’s daddy I’m very shocked too) 
Fast forward to now , I decided to talk to the man I met from work again ( aka former colleague) surprisingly he still remember me I did his favor and transfer him some information from company to his email ( just so you know we both work in investment banking ) this act could potentially get me fired and blacklisted from my company but I did for him . after such a long time I was thinking of him and I miss sex we had . It touches my soft side after rewinding these happy times . So I decided to ask him hanging out again . Will my current man be upset if I do this ? Last time I was at his apartment clearly he’s txting other girls while I was lying on his bed. ……",dating
3359,I(23f) have been struggling to communicate but when I make an effort it doesn’t seem good enough,"I’ll admit I’m not the best texter in the world and I have been slacking in that department. I work nightshift and sometimes I’m only able to text when I’m up at night. 

So this guy I’m seeing had an issue with my sparse texts. Which I’m trying to fix and be more responsive everyday. We have been talking but sometimes I get irritable or stressed so I’m like I won’t respond and it’s around 9 pm anyway. So we’ve been talking for awhile. 

But lately he seems to focus on the fact that I’m not a big texter. He brings it up when I’m not being open about talking to something. Like today he starts going on about wanting to talk about over text or call like it’s a problem that I don’t want to discuss why I have commitment issues. 

Then after he’s basically saying he wants to break up to focus on his career since I make a lot of money. Which I’m taking with a grain of salt because people use excuses like that to leave all the time. I’m confused why this is brought on like yeah I struggle with texting him but that was due to work. 

And we hadn’t been seeing each other either that often. So he wasn’t happy with that and now he’s saying he isn’t at peace. So Ik I haven’t been the best gf in the world lately but I just feel like this is coming from nowhere. 

It feels awful because it’s my fault that this is happening. I’m not the best at going out and hanging out with people. So now he’s probably done with me being closed off. Idk he says he wanted to support me but I’m the type of person who doesn’t really need “support” like help with stuff. Or I never ask for help. It just seems like he needs to be needed by someone. 

But yeah he randomly asks about his cooking skills because I told him I didn’t like his food. Idk it hadn’t tasted the best to me but I already told him that. I feel like maybe I should’ve lied because it seems like everyone but me has said he’s a good cook. My taste buds are off I don’t each much home cooking. So now I feel bad because I can’t lie.😭

It’s all my fault that this is happening…",dating
3360,Going to their house on the second date?,"I'm F 22 and he's M 21 went on a really great date and it lasted so much longer than expected we really hit it off and for once I don't get a terrible gut feeling, my gut is normally right when it comes to bad people unfortunately I've been in a lot of DV situations and have been SAd a few times. 

He's not giving me any red flags or any bad gut feelings and I'm quite excited about connection, he wants to take me to his apartment because there's a rooftop area where you can look at the stars and look over the city and he wanted to get food and smoke up there.

Does it seem like a bad idea safety-wise? I've really been struggling to find somebody that I click with and feel safe around especially with my trauma so I don't want to give up this opportunity but I also don't want to put myself at risk I'm not sure how to stay safe in this situation, do you guys have any safety tips?

3362,My (23F) 7mo boyfriend’s (34M) vaping addiction causing anxiety and strain on the relationship,"I (23f) have been with my bf (34m) for 7 months. We love and respect each other and we both treat each other very well. When we started dating, I noticed he vaped occasionally. I told him I don’t feel comfortable with him vaping as it is not good for his health. If he was just a friend, I wouldn’t bring it up as I am open-minded but because he is my partner and I saw a future with him I want him to be healthy. He told me he would stop but for his health and not for me, and I agreed as I don’t like being controlling and I want him to be happy with his decision. 
Fast forward a few months into the relationship and he doesn’t stop vaping. If anything I see it increasing. I bring it up again how I am scared for his health and I want to build a future with him. A few days he tells me he quit vaping and I was very happy. Then after a week he return to it. I don’t say anything. But I notice his habit has increased over time. He is definitely an addict (keep in mind he was a cigarette smoker before). In the past few months he has to vape everywhere. Even when we go in a pool and have a good time, he has to step out and vape, when we drive he vapes, when we are laying down and etc. It’s been making me super ANXIOUS whenever he vapes. I become paranoid how he is going to develop lung disease be linked to ventilator and etc. I even have been going back home crying because of this anxiety and worry. Now I have been thiniking about it, I don’t think I can continue this relationship, I don’t see a future where he vapes forever, get possibly sick one day, and we spend our life in the hospital or he passed away and leave me alone.

I really don’t what to do. I love him so much and he treats me like a queen and he is crazy about me. I am crazy about him too. I am very scared of breaking up with him as I love him and don’t want to be alone and just don’t know what to do. Sometimes I regret getting into this relationship in the first place and think I should’ve just stopped seeing him the moment he vaped. But I liked him when we went on on first dates. 

Now should I maybe wait and see if one day he will quit? I also don’t want to sound like I am giving him an ultimatum and that’s why if I talk to him I am thinking of telling him he can keep doing whatever he wants as it is his life but this relationship is not for me.
For the past few weeks I have been very depressed and distracted becuase of this issue. And I feel guilty whenever I hang out with him. Help please:(",dating
3363,Someone I'm interested in from my past moved to my city,"Looking for some advice here. I just saw a few days ago that someone I grew up around (all the way from childhood through high school) moved to the same city I currently live in. We used to have a good bit of overlap in our friend groups, but I wouldn't necessarily say that we were ever really good friends. Now, we don't have any overlap in work, school, friendships anymore, but they were always extremely nice to me and everyone else, and that is the kind of person I'm interested in pursuing nowadays. **How do I initiate a casual outing or conversation having very little contact with this person for the last 5ish years?** I still have their contact info, but reaching out just out of the blue seems difficult for me to approach and I wouldn't know what to say in the first place.

3367,Navigating the Dating Scene in the US as a Hispanic Man: Why does it seem more challenging?,"Hello!

I’m a Hispanic man who moved to the United States about a year ago. I learned English in my home country, so I have a noticeable accent. I live in Colorado Springs, keep myself fit, and stand at 5’6 ft tall.

I’ve been finding it quite challenging to date women here, and I’ve been wondering why. Is it due to my ethnicity, my accent, or perhaps certain stereotypes? It’s been causing some insecurity that I’ve been trying hard not to let it show.

Despite these hurdles, it’s worth mentioning that I’ve often been told by other Latinos that I’m good-looking. Even a close friend once complimented me on my appearance. Intriguingly, my sister (white Latina) who also lives here seems to have considerably more success in the dating scene. She gets asked for her number quite frequently by men of different backgrounds, including white, black, and European men. Back in my home country, I was actually quite successful in dating. This contrast makes me wonder if there’s something specific about the dating culture here in the US that I’m missing or not understanding.

I’ve tried my hand at dating apps and sites with no significant success. On one occasion, I was ghosted after revealing my Hispanic origin. In another instance, I had a pleasant conversation with a woman who seemed to have a lot in common with me, but she declined to share her phone number for us to know each other better.

My preferences lean towards black, white, and white Latina women. The lack of success I’ve had so far is starting to make me feel rather depressed and further insecure.

I would appreciate any insights, advice, or shared experiences that could help me understand why I’m finding this process so challenging. Has anyone else faced a similar situation, and how did you cope with it? I’m particularly interested to hear from women who can shed some light on their perspectives.

Thank you!",dating
3368,How to initiate conversation at work if you don’t have an excuse to talk to them in the first place?,"There's a really cute guy that works in my building but in a different department. So we pass each other a lot (I have to walk by his desk multiple times a day during my job, also sometimes in the hallway, in the parking lot, etc), but never actually have a reason to interact or start a conversation. I've caught him glancing my way a few times when I walk by his desk, and he always smiles at me, and I try to make a point to look his way when I pass by his desk and smile back. But I really want an excuse to actually interact or talk to him... I just can't think of one. I'm not shy - I don't mind making the first move. But I feel like I need an ""in"" or a reason to start a conversation, since most of the time when I pass by, he's sitting at his desk working and I don't want to just walk over and interrupt him. Honestly, I don't even know if he's single or not, I just know I'd love to actually meet him. 

Does anyone have any ideas about how I could initiate a conversation or make it more obvious that I'm interested in meeting him? I'd love some tips or suggestions. Thanks!",dating
3369,"I want to ask a girl out, but I want to get to know them first, for once. How do I ask, without forcing the frame of DATING on it? Or should I just ask anyways?","As the title suggests, I want to know them first. I want to make sure they're the right way to go. Idk this girl well, but I bs with her a lot, get laughs out of her, and I'm attracted to HER. Not just for looks, but her personality attracts me. I can tell she'd make a good friend either way, so I don't wanna risk the chance of screwing it up by flat out saying I want to take her out, because lot of people will only see that as ""he wants romance with me, and that's it"". But I do see myself enjoying being around her no matter what, and don't wanna screw that up, if I can. 

More or less, I'm looking for advice on how to ask somebody out in a way that shows I don't ONLY want one thing, but I'm obviously open to it. That way they know I'm interested, but also not gung-ho about it either, and still want to get to know them either way. Romantically or not. I enjoy her presence, and want that one way or another, and I'm just not sure what the best way to approach that would be. Usually I know if I just flat out want to go on dates, or just be friends. Plus, I understand it's better to have a partner whom your best friends with, which I've honestly never had, so I don't got the experience there either. 
Is there good suggestions for a halfway of this, do I just ask to be friends, or do I ask her out, and hope that it all works out either way?

That isn't to say that the relationship has weakened, just that it has gotten somewhat routine.
  
I saw an ad for a 2 player card game for a couples date night, and think the idea sounds really fun - so far the best one that I have seen is one called ""Why don't we spice it up"", that has three decks of differing topics, although every game that I have seen seems to be geared towards newer couples and broaches topics that a new couple might not know about each other.

3373,Is being anxious about the future during the initial days of being in a relationships normal?,"I (F24) been seeing a man (M27) for two months now- we’ve been going on dates at least weekly. We had the “what are we talk” a week ago, where we both expressed feelings for each other. I said that I was looking for a relationship and he said that he was stressed by the idea of being in one but was open to doing it if I wanted it because he wanted to keep seeing me. He has confessed to being a people pleaser and struggling to set boundaries. We had a long talk that night about what a relationship can look like and at the end of the night he kissed me and said he wants to do this with me. When I saw him for our next date after the talk, I brought up our conversation to ask how he has been feeling. I said that I was worried that I had pushed him into this when he has expressed hesitations. He said that he felt very heard and respected during our conversation and that I hadn’t pushed him into anything. He was anxious about the future because he felt that he would either be in a long term commitment or be heartbroken but he said he’s enjoying being in the present with me. 

I really like this guy but I’m worried that he’s not in a headspace to really be in a relationship and that him expressing his anxieties around the future when we have just started dating, might be a sign. He’s been really great since our conversation- texting a lot and making plans for us to see each other but I can’t drop the fear that I might have pushed him into this. My friends say that the start of a relationship should be blissful and not have these anxieties.

We stay at the office after 7-8PM even when everyone left, but nothing ever happened besides subtle flirting, compliments, dreamy eye contact and some finger sweeps when he takes my glass to refill it. He behaved differently with me from other female coworkers and to me it seems like he also likes me.

It’s obvious he’s shy with me and he even said he’s an overthinker. I’m really attracted to him physically, mentally and emotionally, I even told him once that watching something is not why I spend time with him, but he just said “you know I know”.

We are both single, straight and open for dating, no confusion there.

Everyone who knows the full story has told me I should stop waiting for him to make the move and giving him subtle hints, but just directly tell him I like him and wanna go out with him. 

I’m afraid of rejection as I would still be forced to see him at least once a week at the office, but it’s been going on for so long and I don’t wanna wait more or get feelings if he doesn’t feel the same about me.

When we spend time together it’s nice, all good, we act and do couple things, but we are not in a relationshio because she said she first has to get over her ex. Things are complicated because her ex is still in the picture.

-Basically even after he kissed 2 other girls in front of him, him being a drug addict, him insulting her private part saying she needs labioplasty, even after he had sex with her best friend, she still hangs out to play tennis with him, still accepts him around in her group of friends and they still talk daily. All would be so peaceful if no exes were involved. 

-I let her know it bothers me, and she knows that. But she assured that nothing is happening between them.

-One time we did talk about our situation and she did say she feels the pressure of a relationship coming from me a bit. To which I said I do want a relationship, but not as long as it’s with a girl who still isn’t over someone.

-Recently we did not see each other that much, so no activities together, and honestly I didn’t complain about her going out where her ex is, but I stopped kissing her. To at least try to give a signal.

-I feel like I’m in a circle where after it’s going well for a while, I hear about her ex again and I’m acting mad even without wanting to show it.

What I want? I want things to be peaceful and simple between me and her, but with an ex involved I can’t.
So the solution for me, as I see it now, is to not talk for a while and let her decide if that is what she wants. Of course, if I tell her then I won’t say it’s for a while, but for good. And trust me I like this girl with all my heart, like I actually like her and she knows that.
So I was thinking of telling her something face to face, and I realised the reason I’m not telling her is because I’m afraid she will go back to her ex, right between his pants. That thought disgusts me. Especially because I know 1 of the 2 things will happen, 1-either she will go back to her ex then come back to me, which I won’t want her after
2-we will stop talking then she will text me to talk

-I guess I’m asking, what should I say so that I can be effective and also let her know that these things bother me and that if she wants me to take her seriously she needs to stop the ex thing?",dating
3384,FWB went cold then recently told me that don’t want to do it anymore.,"Well the title pretty much sums it up. This girl I’ve been in a FWB that I’ve been seeing since March decided she wanted to call it quits. Basically last week she said she didn’t want to hang and then this week she was like “I don’t want to do this anymore” I did like her a lot, so when she told me it kind of broke me down a little. I basically said yeah I felt the energy shift on your part and basically just wished her the best. Part of me wants to know why, but I don’t think that’s a fair question to ask. What do you guys think?",dating
3385,"No matter how I explain how I feel, it ends in an argument","I try every which way to express how I feel. Sometimes I mess up and get frustrated and shout but this evening I tried to express a small bugbear nicely. 

Context: going for breakfast tomorrow morning. I asked if he could pick me up. He said no! You said you were walking. 
Me: no?! I said I’d walk if you wouldn’t pick me up 
Him: sigh I don’t want to drive past where breakfast is to pick you up it doesn’t make logistical sense 

He was pretty exasperated saying this and started getting defensive saying ‘fine I’ll come get you’ so I said Noo it’s ok I just wanted to know why you say no that’s all.

Anyway I left the interaction feeling like I was a huge burden because he wouldn’t drive the same distance to grab me but have to go back on himself a bit. 

Me personally I would pick him up no problem but I know everyone is different.

Anyway I wanted to briefly explain to him how I felt but in a non attacking way.

I said to him that I understood he’s never intend to hurt my feelings but I felt a bit like a burden and I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t drive a few minutes more despite having to go back on himself after. 

He explained his reason which I accepted but then he was like that’s the end of the conversation then not like I understand why you got butt hurt. If you understand my intention wasn’t to hurt your feeling why did you even carry on feeling sad. You chose to feel that way and the way you got to feeling like that makes no sense.

I said that I felt dismissed and this conversation wasn’t meant to stem into an argument. I just wanted to tell him how I felt and move on. 

I’ve been in relationships before where I could always say oi this upset me and they’d go oh sorry didn’t mean it apologies 

Now it’s ‘so what you can say this hurts your feelings and I can’t find that annoying because I don’t think it’s worthy of being sad about’ 

Ughhhhh",dating
3386,How can i start with dating?,"I’m F19 and never been in relationship. I’m so sick of being lonely and just want someone to love. However i have no idea how to do this. I don’t know what to do and what not to do, what is expected from me and what to expect from other. Another negative is that i’m aloof, not talkative and can’t keep the conversation going. I tried going out more, like gym, library, mall but i’m shy and had no luck. Right now i’m in another country for vacation and thought that it would be nice to find someone, so i set up a profile on dating app, but i kinda don’t want to meet with people from there, cause everyone’s asking to meet so early and i feel like they only want to hook up, and i don’t want to. I’m also afraid of dates and dating. I’m asking myself questions like what if he won’t like how i look irl (i look way better in photos, and i’m slightly overweight so there’s possibility that the other person will be disappointed when he sees me), what if it will be quiet and awkward most of the time and i won’t know what to do with it. Since i have no experience in dating, kissing and other stuff, i feel hopeless and very nervous about these things. So i was hoping to find some advice here, like what to do on first date and dates after, when is the right time to hold hands, kiss and pair the willy (and how to do it for the first time :)), maybe how to actually talk or if finding first love on dating app is even a good idea.",dating
3387,Attractiveness is the Issue,"Edit: I am using the scale of 1-10 because if I was to go into the intricacies of attractiveness, and possibly even explore the racist notion of “conventional attractiveness” we would be here all day. Numbers are easy enough for anyone to understand. I’m trying to make this understandable to all without too much explanation.

So here’s what I’m finding out about people regarding their attractiveness: it’s creating a problem no matter where they are at.

According to dating apps, hetero men go for hetero women who are above them in attractiveness. Hetero women go for the top 10% of attractive hetero men. So if a man is a 6/10, he’ll usually go for the range of 7-10. This doesn’t usually work out for him. Then there’s the women who, no matter what attractiveness they are, usually want just the men who are 9/10 or 10/10. Now the thing is, only the women who are 9/10 or 10/10 have success with the men of equal attractiveness. No, the women do not have a better time either.

Here’s the problem though: they all seem to have equal issues with dating regardless. Except for the men who were 9s and 10s.

Here’s the funny part: whether the men are conventionally attractive or not, unless they are 9s and 10s, they get very little, if any attention at all. The 9’s and 10s’s are the only people to experience the same dating app experience as a good deal of women: a flood of matches.

Even if a man was considered a 7/10 or an 8/10, their match success wasn’t found to be much better than the men who were rated less attractive. Yes, they got more matches on average, but at a drastically reduced rate than the 9s and 10s. Like the bell curve was ridiculously weighted in favor of the top 10% of men.

Meanwhile, women that were at least a 5 usually found themselves with almost as many matches as all of their other counterparts.

Now here’s the important part so pay attention: they all were almost all miserable except the top 10% of men. It’s insane.

Men - 1-5/10 - no matches if any.
Women - 1-5/10 - usually a moderate amount of matches
Men - 6-8/10 - usually a moderate amount of matches
Women - 6-10/10 - hundreds if not thousands of matches
Men - 9-10/10 - hundreds of matches, sometimes thousands.

Interestingly enough, I usually hear stories of the attractive men 6-10 being either decent, good, or horrendously bad. Normally, the more attractive the men were, the more awful they were towards potential female partners, usually being mostly the top 10% of attractive men.

And no secret why, they have the most access to women, and the 9s and 10s have probably been that way their whole life. So they had the highest likelihood from what I’ve heard of being users. The men who were at even a slightly lower range tended towards significantly decreased success if any at all.

Completely different for the women. Only the “unattractive” women found themselves with relatively low options. The attractive women have more matches than a human could ever handle. Usually neither were satisfied. The attractive women complained about being use for sex, the unattractive women complained about a small pool.

The advice: stop dating people above you attractiveness and honestly date people who match you or are slightly lower. This goes double for the highly attractive women. The women who are 9s and 10s are probably not gonna be treated well by the men who are 9s and 10s, apparently. 

If you’re having trouble with the particular attractiveness rating you’re dating, whether they are using you or not even matching with you, date lower. I get it, we all want more than we are, but that’s not getting you more. You’re gonna need to be honest with yourself and date people in your range, or lower, sometimes much lower if you’re up there.

In the paraphrased words of Taylor Tomlinson: you want Chris Hemsworth, but you need Seth Rogen. Make peace with it.

I’m talking to all of you, men and women. The problem is attractiveness and it’s not gonna change unless you do!",dating

3396,Any thoughts,"Recently went on a third date with a girl. We hardly talk in between dates, so most of the getting to know each other occurs during the date. I asked her about her past relationship. She said she has been single for 11 years. Even mentioned that she gets upset with her single friends who entered relationships. One interesting thing she said was that she’s staying single until she finds a relationship that’s better than being single. And that I’ve been the only guy who been on more than one date during that 11 year span. 

Last week, I brought up going to a restaurant after going to Disneyland. She loved Disneyland and I’ve never been. She thought I ghosted her and said I only reach out sparingly. Which is somewhat true but she’s never initiated a conversation or date idea. I feel like I am wasting my time but I feel like there’s some about her that I need to know. Maybe not dates but more phone calls or FaceTimes.

Any thoughts??",dating

Is two month too much time apart?

(Either way, I can't change the situation because I will still be gone for two months, but looking for peoples opinion, especially men - if a girl you started seeing and liked leaves for two months, would things fizzle/get cold for you? or would you also want to pick up where you left off when she's back?)",dating
3402,My (22F) boyfriend (21M) smokes weed daily,"Me (22F) and bf (21M) have been dating for 6 months. I personally don't drink or smoke, and my boyfriend solely smokes weed. In the beginning of our relationship, he didn't smoke as much and it seemed like an insecurity of his. He asked me if It was okay and I said yes, as I was under the notion that he only smoked here and there. However, after moving in with him temporarily for the summer, I realized that he smokes every day and is high the majority of the time. When he gets high, he usually just sits on his phone and plays video games. I was initially turned off, because his place was also extremely messy and I spent the day cleaning; because I can't live in a place extremely dirty.

My boyfriend struggles with depression and anxiety, and is otherwise a really great boyfriend. My family loves him, they see that he truly loves me, and they think we are good together. I have never felt loved like this from another man and I believe that he is loyal and truly does right by me. I sometimes take him for granted and admit that I can treat him better. Overall though, I love him and I would consider myself a trustworthy, honest, loving partner.

I don't think it's fair to either my boyfriend and I to stay in a relationship where I have to control him (ask him to stop smoking) but I don't think it is fair to myself to be uncomfortable. I sought my mother for advice, and she told me that an ultimatum may be the last resort now. I then told my boyfriend that he has to make a choice between our relationship and weed, and he said ""fuck your ultimatum."" He said my ultimatum is wrong and no healthy relationship should have ultimatums. 

For more context, I have family trauma from a drug addicted incarcerated grandfather, and growing up with a drug addicted stepfather. I understand that weed is ""not that bad"" but being around others that are drunk or high stirs up an overwhelming amount of negative emotions within me. Not following in my grandmothers and mothers footsteps in choosing men addicted to substances is extremely important to me, as I would like to break the cycle. Also, I am very jealous of those that drink or smoke. My personal values don't allow me to partake in those activities, but I hate how others can easily escape their negative emotions and boost their mood. It makes me envious that others can drink and smoke for happiness and a high, while I feel like I have to suffer by enduring reality as it is. 

I am an extremely motivated person. I am a successful collegiate athlete, graduated with my B.A in Pre-Law, and am starting a Masters program while still competing athletically in the NCAA. I would like to make a lot of money one day and I have been told that I am extremely attractive and intelligent. However, I am deeply insecure because I have never felt enough. My choice not to drink or smoke has presented me with a lot of rejection and hate from others. I hate that someone I love so much cannot be happy sober around me, and I constantly feel rejected from the world for a plethora of reasons.

Any clarity and constructive criticism would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone.",dating
3403,Does height really matter?,"this is gonna sound so stupid but I’ve known this guy for about three years now and we’ve stayed friends.

I cannot express to you how sweet this boy talks to me and he really understands me more than most people I’ve met, and I’m not quite sure if I wanna be in a relationship but I don’t want to string him along and no form because I would never ever wanna hurt him but I don’t know how I feel… I drove up to see him a few days ago and we kissed the whole time. I was there, but he doesn’t push sex’s or anything even close to that. we actually stayed up till 5 am just talking and kissing and him telling me how “it’s stupid but from the first day i met you i immediately knew i wanted to be with you when you” but he never pushed me to make a decision - He’s so respectful of me… 
but he’s maybe 5’4 which is taller than me but just no something i’m physically attracted too,but he also doesn’t have a car and I was his first kiss… should I give him a shot? Should I talk to him about not knowing if I wanna be in a relationship right now? I think he understands that I think I made that clear but maybe I should say it more I don’t know I feel regret for kissing him but I don’t because I do love him, if I got a call that he was in the hospital I would be there…but I don’t want to be the only one driving and also how much does height matter? Trust me I feel a lot better when I have a big tall man next to me, but I don’t want to regret missing out on someone who treats me as great as he does emotionally…. Yeah let me finish this by clarifying. We haven’t like been on a ton of dates and he hasn’t showered me in gifts or anything. It’s just the way he talks to me since the first day I met him has made me feel like a princess.

I travel for work so I very much understand that meeting in person is hard but we’ve expressed sexual interests and shared personal details and I want to finally see/talk in person instead of just gaming or snapchatting. 

Already mentioned and asked if he’s talking to others and he said he went on a few dates before we really started to talk more but nothing happened. I will mention that yes we talk everyday but he will sometimes not text back as much 1-2 times a week and apologize that he’s been busy but I can see he was active on snap during that period.

We met at his house because I don’t want people in my house. After the date he texted me and told me that he had a good time and he wanted to come to my place next time. We texted all the next week and slowly over the course of 2 weeks he started not reading my messages as fast and I saw he unmatched me on Tinder so I assumed he wasn’t interested anymore and so I deleted him on social media. Like 5 mins after deleting him, he DM’d on two platforms asking why I unadded him, so I told him I thought he was uninterested and I was going to move on. He said he was still super interested and sent me some sweet texts to reassure me and told me his schedule was super shitty and he’s been busy, but now we haven’t talked in a few days so I am confused af.

The other day I texted her asking when we are going to do something like smoke or whatever an her reply was “ whenever you want “ I replied dumb with I’ll send you my schedule an she was said “ okay my name —- lol “ now I think this response is because I haven’t locked her down for a real date.

3408,What do I do now? (Crush),"
Okay, so for the last 2-3 weeks of school a girl that had chatted with me a little bit and was nice to me started sitting with me during my class and we were talking for the entire class period every day. She asked for my Spotify and randomly looked up and followed my Instagram in class, I started getting a crush on her and wanted to ask for her snap and to hang out over the summer but I got too scared and didn’t in our last class. Had three days after that and tried finding her, two days I didn’t and one day I ended up just walking behind her too scared. Later that day I added her on snap through her Instagram bio (this was last Thursday). 

She added me back and we snapped a little bit until Sunday morning where I sent a snap that could have started a conversation and I got left on delivered. Yesterday and today I went to the mall that she works at and thought if I saw her I’d ask her to hang out and also ask when she leaves for vacation (she said she was gonna be gone until 4th of July but idk when she said she was leaving) but didn’t see her either times, but today while I was at the mall she snapped me back. 

What should I do now? Should I wait the same amount of time she waited to snap her back? I’m gonna see my cousin that I told her stories about that she thought were funny, and I’m gonna give them an art project that she said I should give them. Should I text her their reaction? Wait 3 days to do it, and then start a conversation (+ asking when she leaves) over snap? I wanna ask her to hang out in person but also wanna keep in touch thru snap when she’s away in vacation. What’s my next move? Do I just wait until she comes back?",dating

3410,29M - Asking for a drink a girl I met once briefly and probably won't see again : too impulsive? What do you think?,"  
Hello,  
I met a girl in a bar, who is a colleague of a friend. She said we were in the same uni 7 years ago but I don't remember her. We chated for like half an hour, then I went looking for another drink and told her I would come back. Then I got intercepted by a friend who introduced me to someone who could have a job for me (I'm looking for one), so I couldn't ""escape"". After that I did not have the occasion to have a one on one conversation with the girl and anyway she left 10min later.   

I enjoyed our conversation, we were getting along fine, and I would have liked to know more about her. I found her very attractive. Unfortunately obvioulsy 30-40 min wasn't long enough to start talking about personnal topics and to ask for her number. Chances are, I will never see her again, so ""getting to know her better"" before making a move isn't an option.

At the end of the night everyone was quite drunk, me included, and I asked my friend for her number.  

Now that I am sobber, I don't know if I should use it. I would like to but I have ADHD and I'm pretty impulsive so I don't always trust my judgment. Would it be unappropriate to ask her for a drink? While saying to her that I enjoyed our conversation and wanted to ask for her number but hadn't had the time?  

On one hand, in general my philosophy is that it's better to be rejected than to have regrets, the limit being that I don't want to pressure people or make them feel too unconfortable. On the other hand, she would probably think my proposition comes a little out of the blue and in addition I don't know if she's single (yes, that's not good).  

Altough I would prefer not to pass for a creep or a weirdo, above all I don't want to make this girl feel ill at ease.   

Do you think giving it a try would really be a bad idea?  

Thanks",dating
3411,Did I ask out my neighbor?,"I recently met my neighbor in crossing. We have lived next to each other for a few months but have never met face to face. Last week she helped me open a few doors while I was bringing in my laundry/groceries. We exchanged names after for the first time.

The next day I left a thank you note on her door with my number incase she needed help or something. I didn’t think anything about it but the next day she texted me to give me her number. We texted a bit back and forth about how neither of us have met anyone else in the building or past building and thought it was cool we met. We both said feel free to knock on each other’s door or text. Yesterday, I asked if she would like to get to know each other and she she said yes and we will hanging out tonight. 

I’m not sure if I have asked her out or not. I’m open to the idea, but I’m not sure how she perceived it. Looking for advice on how to navigate this one. And what would be appropriate for a first date/hang out.",dating

3413,"I (24M) have been dating the woman of my dreams, but I can't help feeling not good enough.. any tips?","So I recently met the woman of my dreams (24F) (Or so I believe). We hit it off after meeting on TikTok Live of all places. 

After meeting up a few times it got more intense and I found myself daydreaming and thinking about her ALOT.

She tells me all the time she misses me when I haven't seen her for 1-3 days and I feel exactly the same. 

I can't help feeling like I'm not good enough though. Sometimes the vibes are off (imo). She's swerved my kisses a couple of times from lips to the cheek. I mean it probably don't mean anything but my over-thinking self can't help worry she don't feel how she claims. 

I know she definitely does love having me there but myself personally can't shake the feeling of not being good enough or enough to make her happy. 

I know she cares but I do I get myself to recognise that? I also struggle with ADHD.

 basically secured Girl of my dreams. Can't help feeling like I'm not good enough. She says I am. Why can't I believe her? Any tips on changing the way I think?",dating
3414,Does this means its over for him?,"Please anyone with any sort of advice ....please help me calm down :/ 

So I met this guy online through a study group and have been with him long distance since Sept 2022.

He's literally everything I want in a guy and vice versa. we both started spending the whole day together. We both are introverted people and only have very few friends to each other. 
 
We both were preparing for this medical exam so we would study together. Even though we were far we gave each other surprises and made plans to meet up as soon as possible. But because of visa issues and my university was still on, we couldn't meet then.  

Everything, literally everything was fine up until May 26th, 2023 when he had to move out of his house to prepare for his own country's medical license exam. 

Initially we would try to find time and somehow make up time for each other. But from june 2nd, slowly he has stopped responding to my messages and doesn't even try to send me few messages in a day even as to what is he doing or what's going on over there. 
He keeps saying tht he's so busy studying and he goes from classes to library and then back to hostel. 
But doesn't even inform me what time he's doing all this. This one day I couldn't reach him at all and I literally lost it that night because I had no way to find out whether he's safe also or not. 

This distance is literally getting the worst of us and idek what to do anymore. It feels as if I am the only one running the relationship right now. 
He asked me several times to wait till his exams are over and his old self will return but how do I know that?? 
 
At least give me some sort of assurity that eveything will be fine after all this. Is that too much to ask for? 

It's so frustrating for me to still stick around when am just asking for few seconds, not even minutes of his day. It has literally come to me begging him for some time. 

He has even mentioned that all of our future plans that we made together, he may not be able to commit to it. And that I should find someone better. Idk if he means it or jsut saying because hes not able to reciprocate at the moment. He's not even trying to fight for me. He's so upset nowadays. It kills me that he doesn't smile anymore 😔

I told him that whatever it is come and talk to me atleast, I will be there and help him no matter what, even if its financially I will be there. But nothing. He doesn't even have time to come and dump his problems or frustrations to me also. Like I wanna listen and help you out. 

We are literally days apart from meeting each other as I will visit to meet him immediately after his exams. If I have to put the effort to make this happen, I will do it. When I asked him will he be excited if I come, he said its upto you. 

Am so scared what if I travel all the way only to see in his eyes that he has no more feelings left? It's gonna break my heart. 

I wanna believe that everything is going wrong because of the stress of his exams but what if in reality it's all over? 

Just rn, I texted him saying when can you talk to me he said I am busy I can't. And now his phone is unreachable and I have no way to know when he's gonna come and text me. 
He is not even thinking of me at all as if I am nothing. 

I honestly don't know what to do anymore 😕 😪",dating
3415,Should I(51f) go on the date (49m).,"I recently split from a relationship of 4 months.

3416,28 M NYC Dating help,"So here's my speel I suffered from anxiety, depression, and overthinking for years. Not to mention a lack of confidence as well as a fear and more so a feeling of undeserving of love. Add in battling weight as well as some tragedies in my life I think this past year I took a turn for the better. I've lost 100lbs in just about 18 months, I've became a Peace officer of NY, and actually work as an instructor now. I finally started my dreadlocks journey which is going good but my issue still lies in relationships. I tend to overthink and probably end up ruining things so I have no experience with long term relationships and the last girl I was really hooking up with as a friend with benefits I genuinely really liked or maybe still do like her but she had no interest in pursuing a relationship. It sucks but it's her decision and I have to respect that, she doesn't owe me that. I'm just sick of trying dating apps and honestly because I'm 6'3 and bad experiences in the past I feel awkward approaching women. Which is funny because when it's just in a friend sense I have no issue there but going to try and approach to do more well it's hard. I need more dating experience but also I just want to deal with no games, no ""Oh he's too nice and available so I don't like him"" crap. I don't see what's wrong with being there for someone and being nice and supportive. I don't really know what I'm doing even here but screw it I'm just trying my best.

3417,How do I hit up my crush from the other class?,"Hey guys, I‘m from Germany (so excuse some writing mistakes I may make) and there is this girl in my parallel class who I find kinda fancy. She is in my parallel class and we share some courses together. I often catch her looking at me when we are in the same class but she seems quite shy. We don’t share the same group of friends or something, so I didnt had many opportunities to start a conversation with her and I don‘t know how I could initiate one that wouldn‘t feel out of place or weird. Sometimes we smile at each other, and if I have the opportunity to greet her before class, she greets back in a very beautiful way (but idk maybe thats my imagination). We follow each other on Instagram, I sometimes post pictures of me in my Story hitting the gym or with some Friends of mine, she looks at them but Shows no reaction (e.g. liking my story). She never posts anything, so I couldn‘t like anything of her or give her a hint that I may be interested in her. Because we share some classes I also got her phone number. I honestly don‘t have that much experience of texting women out of nothing, all of my relationships I had developed via a friends group where I had the oppotunity to talk about interesting things or make her laugh.

3419,The guy i was seeing told me he does not want anything serious,"I was seeing with guy for like a month and honestly let me tell you, I've not had a connection with anyone at all for the last 5 years, and this man really did the trick for me, I could not have asked for anything more in a human being. 

Then after a make out session at his house he lets me know that he's really not looking for anything serious and that he can already see me getting attached. Because he does not want to ""hurt"" me, he decided we should part ways romantically - however we still see eachother pretty often as we work rather close. 

I was not expecting a ring from him but i also did not foresee things escalating so quickly, he assumed i'd fall in love in a couple of months and that he's doing what's best for me for now. 

This was last week, he wrote me twice to check up on me and make sure I was fine. And I can see him around, he's not fine either.

This seems pretty pointless to me, if we're both unwell because of eachother then... is this really the correct approach? 

I know he's not ready for a relationship, when I am. But for now his idea of relationship is something that sofocates me in any case, so I would argue we're pretty even - he cant give more and i cant accept more. I REALLY dont see the issue here.

3422,Fake Tinder,"TLDR: My girlfriend (23F) & I (22M) have been together 5+ years, her co-worker showed her an account on Tinder that is using my photos (maybe my name) and she believes that it is me. How can I reassure her / prove the account is not me?

So back in approximately February I received a text from an old co-worker of my girlfriends (23F) and I’s (22M) asking what had happened to us, I was very confused by the question and so was my girlfriend. The old co-worker then explained that she had seen ‘my’ account on Tinder, I explained that I don’t have an account on Tinder and that my girlfriend and I are still going strong (we have been dating for about 5 & 1/2 years). 

Honestly forgot about the whole situation and moved on, figured it was a Catfish and it would pass. 

Last night 6/14, my girlfriend comes home from work relatively dry we have a brief conversation about work and my doctors visit. She shortly after sat down on our bed and says “Can I ask you something?” at this point i’m already on edge due to her off putting attitude and her seriousness of the question. I state “Sure” in more of a confused tone, she then began to ask me if I had / was using Tinder. I’m not going to lie I borderline freak out, my heart dropped and I instantly began trying to question her question. It soon came out a current co-worker had came across the account and sent a screen recording to her, she stated that the photos are fairly recent. 

She ended up going to her friends house until approximately 11pm, during this time I spoke to my closest friend about the situation and I sent her a text essentially trying to explain that I don’t have Tinder and even if I wanted to all my credentials are banned (due to making an account while under age). 

I have a strong feeling she doesn’t believe me, she still slept at home last night and still said “I love you too” in response to mine before leaving this morning and going to bed last night.

How would I even go about explaining / proving that the account is not mine?",dating

3424,"Help, am I being insecure?","Quick History: I have been hurt in the past by someone I thought I loved a lot. I caught her cheating on me on Valentine’s Day. Because of this sometimes my mind will create fake situations that originate from some piece of reality concerning infidelity or lies. Any advice to conquer these trust issue would be highly appreciated. 

Scenario: it’s a Friday night around midnight, I haven’t gotten a text back from my girl in like 4 hours. I know she is off work at this point but oh well I’m sure she’ll get back to me. I head to my local bar down the street. I see her car. I walk in. I see her. At the bar, having a drink, with a female friend and a male. I was surprised. She looks up and sees me and looks surprised herself and beckons me over. She says hello and explains that she is waiting for her friend she used to work with to arrive. We’ll call him Sean. When she tells me this I can’t help but remember I was waiting for a text back. I think to myself, “I have known this girl for a while now, we are solid” but I still can’t help but feel a way about not getting a text and stumbling into this situation. I tell her I understand and walk away and let her have her space to enjoy her night. I did not want to interject in her plans.

Sean eventually gets there closer to 1am. I see him sit next to her and talk for a bit and then they get up and walk toward me. She introduces me to him and ask me if I would want to join them and have some drinks. Again, I did not want to interject in her plans for the night and I could have said no but I felt it would have been awkward to deny that request so I join them. Admittedly I had a good time hanging out, having some drinks and such. Then we leave, bar closes at 3am. 

We are waking to our vehicles and I give her a kiss good bye and head to my car. Sean ask for a lighter to light his cigarette and then they start talking. I have been walking away so I cannot hear much of what is being said and I can’t see over the cars but I hear, “so we can just make plans for another time”. 

I admit I was not in a completely sober state at that time but hearing that made me feel kinda silly. I realize I don’t even have plans with her in the near future and she didn’t ask me that when I walked away. I didn’t ask to be included in the plans tonight and here I am feeling like a ruined their original plans.

I decide to text her and ask more about this guy Sean and mention I heard her mention making plans. She immediately goes into defensive mode and accuses me of being jealous and not trusting her. I tried to explain that I felt it was a logical question a man might have if he walked into a bar and saw his girl sitting there waiting on another guy to show up he has never heard of before. She states that she told me upfront she was their to meet an old coworker and me asking her for more clarification at the conclusion of the night insist distrust. 

We didn’t speak for 2.5 days and talked it out yesterday. She insist she did nothing wrong, that I am being jealous and displaying insecurities. I told her that I was trying to be transparent with her in regard to my feelings at the time and she insist I should have kept those feelings to myself and reason through them before coming to her. I think I was wanting some reassurance at that moment that I was tripping and just had a bad perspective of the night ending. She stated that that would have been coddling me and I am displaying codependent behavior. 

Am I tripping? Should I just take some time to be single and reason through some things or are my feelings valid?

3432,No future because partner does not love herself,"August last year I (M25) met this girl (20F) via Tinder. There was great chemistry and we dated for almost three months, but when I talked to her about making things official, she said she wasn’t ready because she was in a bad place mentally because of her life circumstances (parents divorced, living with dad who she does not have a good relationship with, working a lot and long commutes to work and uni every day) and did not feel like she could be an equal contributor to a relationship. As I could not handle continuing the 'situationship', we decided to part ways but we agreed that she would message me once she was better and certain she wanted something serious.

The following months were not easy for me as I was always hoping she would message me again, which made it harder to move on. I definitely learned my lesson here and will always go for a clean cut in the future.

About a month ago (which at this point was half a year after we ended things) she messaged me saying she has been thinking a lot about me lately. Things have changed as she now moved out of her dad‘s place into her own apartment, is doing an internship and overall she feels better. We meet again and everything is as beautiful as it was the last time, maybe even better as she opens up more and definitely is more affectionate now, which eliminates the last doubts I had regarding her being a suitable partner for a serious relationship. We have been seeing each other regularly again for the past month and also agreed to be exclusive to see where things go.

Yesterday I told her that any last doubts I had were gone and that I would like her to officially be my girlfriend. She was hesitant and under tears explained to me that she never was someone‘s official girlfriend and although it‘s just a label, she is scared of it and afraid that she will lose me because she feels like I deserve someone better as she still does not give as much affection as I give to her. She said she has no doubts regarding the relationship between us and that I am literally the best and most caring guy she has ever been with, but it‘s her self worth issues that are in the way.
She left afterwards and I told her she can take a few days to make up her mind.

Does anyone have similar experiences with a partner with self doubts? How did you overcome this issue? Or do you believe is it for the better if I end things for good with her now?

TLDR: Girl (20F) I (25M) am seeing is scared of making things official between is as she has self doubts and thinks I deserve someone better.",dating
3433,Dating guy who’s not over ex?,"Hi, I need your help! 

So I was seeing this guy for over two months, we were having a good time but never kissed or anything. I thought it’s kind of weird, maybe he’s not into me or whatever but he kept making plans. We never talked about our past relationship until recently. 
He told me out of nowhere like two weeks ago about his ex, who had to come over in the weekend because she had to take her stuff from his apartment because he finally wants to get it done. They broke up in December and we’re together for three years. His first real and long relationship. I never knew they lived together but I also never asked. It was kind of surprising and I told him it was weird not to mention it earlier that he lived with her. They were together for three years. Fast forward, we met last week and when we went to the bar, he saw an old friend of his that he met through his ex. He panicked and asked if we could go somewhere else and explained who that guy was, how they met. We were about to go somewhere else but then he decided that we should maybe just stay at the bar after I told him sooner or later he’ll see him anyway with another girl. That night he apologized and the day after he said he doesn’t know why he behaved like that and he might not be 100 percent over the break up which is why he canceled the date the day after because he wanted to spend time on his own. After that I told him we shouldn’t see each other again if he still has strong feelings for him. I told him he can still text me if he’s ready for a new relationship. He agreed and said he’ll be in touch after a while. 

Now I’m thinking maybe I should text him and ask him if we can meet up just to clear some things up and just be friends? I kind of miss him as we became good friends and isn’t it normal to still have feelings for your ex after six months of breakup? Some part of me also hopes that he has feelings for me too as we have similar interests and he always texted me first in the morning. Or do you think he just wants to distract himself? If I only meet him once per week he still has time to move on and think about the break up. We could take it slow right? What should I do? Is there hope?",dating
3434,Girl I have feelings for texted me that I'm a slow thinker and can't joke around,"I [24M] have been talking and dating this girl [23F] for about 4 months now, we've met online and met up about 4 times simply because she is a chef and was very busy but recently quit her job so she's been more available. We're both introverts but she is a bit less introverted.

Yesterday I playfully suggested a date were I come over to her place and we cook something since I've never tasted her cooking, she said no and that her Older Sister wouldn't allow her (she lives in an apartment with her sister) I can't invite her cause I'm currently staying with my parents until I finish my studies. 

Now I'm not that experienced when it comes to relationships and flirting. My last relationship was 4 years ago where she asked me out and that was my first relationship, this year I decided to really try dating, met a couple of girls online and they either ghosted me or lost interest. With her (let's calk her Daisy) I feel like we've had a good connection, she's honestly very pretty, we get along and I have strong feelings for her and she knows it, even mentioned she likes me too, so i was prepared to ask if she's interested in a relationship.

Anyway after she said no to the idea I texted her ""Why, is it because you're naughty?"" in an attempt to flirt and she responded ""Yes, what do you think of it"". I then responded ""I don't mind, I kind of knew you were trouble lol"" in another attempt to flirt. She responded this morning saying ""Why don't you talk to other girls who aren't trouble"" and ""This is what bothers me about you, and why I don't talk to you as much, you're a slow thinker sometimes don't know how to joke around"" 

Now as I said I'm inexperienced and not to mention we haven't even kissed but this suprised me a bit and stung a little because the times I have tried flirting mainly about kissing her, one time she responded lol and the other times she blatantly brushed it off or ignored my flirty texts so I stopped cause I thought it was uncomfortable for her, and in terms of jokes I'm really not sure what she mean't cause I do try and be funny, along with memes so maybe I'm not that funny i guess or charismatic.

I haven't responded yet as I'm now anxious and overthinking. The reason why I wanted to ask if she was interested in a long-term relationship is because a couple of weeks ago i confessed my feelings and she said she felt the same but now what she texted changes things. 

I knew there was a possibility of her saying no but this strongly suggests she might not be even thinking about a relationship when she said ""I should talk to other girls"" or not even talking to me as much.There was an issue where I thought she ghosted me but communicated she was busy but I guess this is how she also felt.

 How should I respond to this and how do I go about this situation as I haven't texted her back yet and noticed she checked out my stories a few hours after the text, I don't want to come off as clingy or butt-hurt but at the same time I wanted to ask about a relationship because its been 4 months now since we met, is it even a good idea to ask her with her recent text.",dating

3436,"Women, are there any phrases/words/descriptors that just instantly put you off a person?","When scrolling dating site bios, or when messaging, are there any little words/phrases that someone can say that may seem okay but just immediately put you off the person?

Mine: 

'Wifey, wifey material/wifed up' or anything along those lines = makes me think that if I end up dating this person I will be pushed into quite a rigid role, something akin to a maid or second mother. 

Similarly, anything about 'gf ""potential"" or implying that the person is a catch I must 'compete' for. = I would never speak to/treat someone I was into like that and it makes me believe that they would be difficult to deal with due to arrogance/narcissism. 

'Doesn't take herself too seriously' = this is something that women and men both say a lot about all sorts of people, but in the context of dating often there seems to be a crossover with the idea that the ideal woman should be prepared to laugh at herself a lot because she is going to be made fun of/put down/not taken seriously.

I'm a 30-year-old man, and I have developed feelings for a guy who is around 45 to 50 years old. He actually already has a partner. They have an open relationship and share a house together.  
I really enjoy spending time with him. We have met a few times, and he is very sweet. He gives me compliments, kisses, and so on. We have also been intimate together. He behaves like a true gentleman.  
The problem is that I really like him, but his dating profile is full of men whom he has listed as ""friends."" I'm unsure about what I mean to him. Usually, when I have sex with men who are only interested in sex, there aren't all the other things like going out to restaurants (where he pays), etc.

After a month we still didn‘t talk about our relationship. 

I was kinda mad one evening because of other things and we had a phone call late at night where i told him that i tried to respect his space but i wanted to know what he wants out of this. 

I told him that I am hurt because it seems like he doesn‘t care and i cried a little bit on the phone. He wanted to talk the next day and ever since then he hasn‘t responded at all and we ignored each other. I didn‘t feel like i should text him because I wanted him to step up and also i would have felt desperate if i would have texted him. 

Its been a week now and he still hasn‘t made contact with me. Which basicially tells me that he doesn’t care.

I (28f) have been with my guy (28m) for 4 years now and we've had our issue's but then again what relationship doesn't right? 🤔 Well for a while now (almost 3 years) we've had a few specific problems, 3 of which was him getting a job and helping out financially and second for us to work on getting into our own place, and delete some stuff off of an app (specifically certain discord servers) and also to take and get rid of some of the people off his psn that's also caused some issue's between us. Long story short none of that happened and I gave him several warnings to do so and to change those thing's other wise there would be consequences, well that turnt out that I finally moved out (then he decides to get a job) a year after the fact. Mind you we are still together to this day and nothing has changed and more issue's keep arising. Both of us are at fault for the half of it but for the better half it's his. I could be wrong but I dunno. I tried for years to make this work out and to be 50/50 as a relationship should be but still yet again nothings changed or happend.. I've expressed to him numerous times to how I felt and so on but there's not a single care in the world from him it seems like and that he just wants to stay living with his parents and hey dont get me wrong it helps saves money but the duration of us being together I was also living with him there and he has had several times to save money to (even when he did put in the effort to have a job but then got fired from and that was in the beginning when we first started to get to know each other) but didn't.

3451,Am I M (29) being played by F (28),"So I’m in a long distance situationship (not a a relationship but we agreed to be exclusive).

We are from two different countries and I met her on Tinder in my Country, we could ‘t have a date here but when she came back to her country she kept talking with me until I said “Fuck it” I bought a ticket and fly over to her house and spent a week there with her after 1 month and half os texting from morning to night everyday!

this was pretty intense for a “first” date! Sex, cuddles, cute words, she said “I love you” to me on the second day, I felt a bit shocked but I went with it and reciprocated.

She never hid her phone from me, gave me her phone code, she even showrd me her tinder account saying that she disn’t reply to people after I told her I bought the ticket, and she even asked me to not go on a date with someone I had planned because it would be strange for her. I didn’t go.

After that wonderful week I came back home and another week passed, and I decided to check Tinder and snoop her acc, wish I saw she was active (3 different distance KM’s) that means she was online and probably swiped. 

I confronted her on that same day about that and she said that she only logged on Tinder to try and delete it but couldn’t because it was too much pressure on her head signalling she was in a relationship with me and we definitely are not in one.

She said that she didn’t swipe and couldn’t do anything with other man, and that I’m everything she looks for in a man (she was the one that said ldr was good) and I was the man in her life now and nothing would change that! She only texted with me and her friends and would not text with other men and do stuff with other man because she was lucky to have me (she told me this a lot of times).

She basically reassured me that everything was fine. I deleted my tinder becausr I didn’t wanna keep checking her, because I have a bit of package from the past (so does she) and my anxiety levels are high.

So this day 29 of May. And today I decided as a fucking dumbass to use a site called cheaterbuster to check her tinder, and surprisingly show that her tinder was still active (people were still viewing her profile and swipping) and said her activity status was offline on the last area she used but she had a new photo on her profile that she disnt have before that gutted me a bit. How much time does a tinder profile goes dark after the app is deleted?

Now I kinda believe her because she is flying to me this weekend and then I will fly to her a weekend in july. And then in July she will fly and entire week to me and the week after Im gonna fly the entire week to her house. I mean why would she play me and then have all this effort, going so far as using vacations days, and using a lot of money in plane tickets (yes we both have all the tickets bought for all flights!). I would understand if I was rich or something like that.

But Im not that attractive imo, I work and still live with my parents, she knows that since the beginning and never judged. And she alwyas told me she is not interested in ONS and that she wants to see what we will be in the future (lovers, friends or nothing at all). 

Am I being naive? Or she really playing me? (If she is playing me it goes against everything she told me about herself and is against what I know and saw when I was in her home!) i know I could ask her to show me her tinder this weekend out of the blue but I dont want to do that, its not who I am.

3453,Am I the problem?,"**Context:**  
I am from the UK, in secondary school (high school for the Americans) and this is a bit of a rant but also I do need some advice. 

I recently broke up with my long distance girlfriend because she could never find time for me. I didn't expect her to drop everything to talk to me or for me to be her first priority because I am aware that our relationship was fairly new. But we had a few arguments and during this she has said that I shouldn't message her on weekends or holidays because she is busy; I shouldn't message her in the mornings because she is getting ready and that I shouldn't message her in the evening because she is studying. So when did she expect me to message her? This wouldn't be such an issue if she wasn't busy 24/7. The day before I broke up with her, she said that there is not a single day that she is free to meet up between then (12th of June) and the end of the summer holidays (1st of September). And I just didn't think that it was gonna work, and I found out when I broke up with her, she didn't either. 

But she gave me some advice after I broke up with her, she told me to be 'less clingy' and to message less. I only messaged her once in the morning, once after school and once in the evening. And I had asked multiple times and she had said that it was ok on many occasions. 

So this is what happened with previous people I was dating:

\- Ex-girlfriend 1 (2020 - dating 2 months). Broke up with me because she didn't actually have feelings for me and never did. Why did she date me then? I don't know either.

\- Ex-girlfriend 2 (early 2021 - dating 2 weeks). Not actually sure why she broke up with me, her initial reasoning was that she wanted to work on herself. However almost every time we've talked since then, she has given a different reason. We met up once. 

\- Ex-girlfriend 3 (late 2021 - dating 2 months). Broke up with me because...well I don't know. I have taken some educated guesses and assumed it was because she got bored of me.

\- Ex-girlfriend 4 (early 2022 - dating 2 weeks). I broke up with her because she, like my recent ex-girlfriend, never made an effort to meet up. The ONE FUCKING TIME we met up, she ignored me most of the time and spent the time talking with her friends, leaving me with one of her guy friends that I had never met before.

\- Ex-girlfriend 5 (mid-2023 - dating 1 1/2 months) - see the massive paragraph above. 

&#x200B;

**Here is the thing I need advice on:**

  
I am aware that I look at relationships very different to most girls. I want to talk as much as possible, meet up a lot and spend loads of time together. However, I have realised that most girls do not want that. So how do I change that?

So after my recent breakup, I have been thinking that maybe I am this issue. All of these girls are usually considered different 'types' of girls. If 3 of my girlfriends only met up once with me, is it because I am annoying to be around? Am I a bad boyfriend? But also, am I too clingy? If so how do I fix that?",dating

3458,Met someone who I have a stronger compatibility with than my ex of 12 years.,"Tldr: ex(29f) cheated on me (29m) after being together for 12 years. Met someone with OLD and been together 10 months and even though it’s long distance, it’s the happiest I’ve been in quite a while. 

This has been marked NSFW, because it will mention sex in a little bit of detail. 

*Chapter 1: The past*

No place better to start than the being so, I was 15 and a virgin when I got with my ex, think she had already had sex at 14, two weeks of dating we had sex. So things were alright throughout the years, but as we progressed into our mid-20’s, I felt like the only one who wanted to have sex. She would not instigate it at all, but for me that was my normal, I didn’t talk about it to other people. 

It got to the point we didn’t have sex for 4 months because I wanted to see when she would approach me for it, never happened. I asked her “do you no longer find me attractive/want to have sex?” And her response was upsetting as she went “I’m not sure how to do it and I was hoping you would do it”. At this point we had been together 6+ years with all the baggage that comes with that and It made me upset that after being together for that long she couldn’t say or do anything about it. 

Fast forward to then relationship breaking down, it’s near Christmas and we haven’t slept together in around 3 months. She tells me that she’s going to see one of her old uni mates for a night out and stay at hers. This friend is around 1 hour away; turns out she was 4 hours away having an affair with a woman. Big surprise to me, especially when I found out by accident. 

The only way I caught on was that on this night out, she accidentally called me, her phone was muffled and I couldn’t hear anything, but I thought I would play a prank and message her “I think we need to talk about what your doing right now”, because I could hear her laughing, the joke would of been “heard you having a good time, how could you do this to me 😭🤣” nothing serious just a bit of light hearted banter. 

She comes home late the next day, all cards on the table, been cheating on me for 3 months etc etc. we break up, I move 150+ miles away. 

*Chapter 2: a failed attempt of OLD*

This happens just before I move far away, in my grief I get sucked into the OLD scene for the first time at 28. Alongside this is crippling anxiety and depression, with a healthy dose of insomnia to really round out the situation and then losing my job due to this, to add some sharp corners to snag myself on. 

It ends up with me moving out of the rented home because the bills are too much for me alone and back into my bedroom at my parents house, not the greatest when OLD. By luck of the draw I managed to get a ONS and let’s just say, I felt like I had just had a mouthful of ash and my skin needed to be flayed off the bone. 

To put that into context, this was the second person I had ever had sex with and still had an overwhelming sense of loyalty to someone who could cheat on me. Turns out moving on, would take a little bit longer than just saying it was over. 

So after a few months of therapy, starting to feel a bit better about myself. Tried OLD again and find myself with an actual sociopath, who was trying to gaslight me into fighting her ex. 

Let’s just say there are people out there, who want to be with good people to hide how shit of a person they are; that lasted around 2 months. 

Back to therapy, with some new and some old problems and managed to get a revelation.

It turns out the closer I got to any sort of relationship with another human, the stronger the pain inside became. When I was alone, it was a picture of myself in my mind, but the image was out of focus and I couldn’t work out what was in it, until I thought of a potential relationship, snapping the picture back into focus, like a mirror cracking down the centre leaving only a warped image of myself and another person separated by this division; thinking that I could never trust this person.

One positive thing about my education is that it allowed me to move 150+ miles away and get  a place of my own. 

*Chapter 3: new city, same OLD*

Turns out, I kinda suck at OLD. Although, when you see some of these profiles, kinda makes you feel like your at the butchers, trying to find the right slab of meat for your taste. 

One miserable date later and chatting with someone else for 2 weeks, leads me to the conclusion I shall forever be alone and I should just move on. 

But as the last glimmer of hope emerges from my brain and smaller brain, to try a new OLD app that allows for a better connection with a person before you meet them. 

This is when I match with my current partner. I’m a fan of women who lean to a more top heavy bias and let’s say, after a handful she’s got enough for second’s. So right off the bat strong physical attraction, second comes the much harder part, personality and intellect. 

For myself, I like a woman who is both intellectually and emotionally equal or higher than I am, turns out I find conversations that have layers a turn on. 

 Check and check, so we have a beautiful woman, who is smart and emotionally mature. Now comes the part which can make the first two points crumble; sexual compatibility. We chat for a week, exchange numbers and arrange the first date. 

I suggest a board game café, if I’m going to be with someone they are going to have to enjoy playing games. She accepts the invite, happily sharing that she always wanted to go there. 

What’s this, a trap? This 3 out of 4 potential, has just gone to the secret boss battle and came back over levelled to the party, I don’t think I can stand a chance at keeping up.

We meet in person for the first time and everything goes perfectly, we end up back at mine and have sex for the rest of the night. 

4 out of 4, we have a winner here. 

*Chapter 4: where we are now*

For myself, I thought that women having a high sex drive was a myth, told only to teenagers by hooded individuals, never to be seen again. 

I’m glad to report, they do exist and my god, life is good. We are currently exploring each others limits and all I can say is “oh my”. For example, I have work at 8am, and while asleep I come round at 5am to having her, sucking a part of my body only men have. I make eye contact and she goes “I was horny and it’s been tempting me all night”. I just got into work on time. 

As someone who always made the advances, to have her start things is world changing. 

We play all sorts of games, chat about philosophy, physics and the conversation never dies.

We’ve been exploring the countryside and cities and museums. She is currently getting her masters and lives a few hours away but that doesn’t stop us from seeing each other as much as possible. 

To finally summarise, I think this is the relationship I wish I’ve always had.

3459,Should I ask to go through his phone ?,"Okay so I F(20) have been dating M (22) for about a year and a half. I love him but he betrayed my trust with another woman (not flat out cheating as far as I know , but overstepping boundaries) so now the trusts not really there anymore.

3460,Howamy dates before talking about the prospect of a relationship,"How many dates should people go on before talking about the prospect of making it official etc. 

Bit of background, she (f22) and I (m23) have been on 5 dates. During the last one, she was very turned on but didn't lead to sex, as we had talked about taking it slow (she has a high sex drive where as I not so much). But after the last date, sex is going to be on the cards for next time.

Anyway back to the question, part of me wants to ask her over text, what her expectations of a relationship are and what exactly she is looking for but then other part of me wants to discuss it in person. Looking for a bit of insight from all parties.

He told me he doesn’t date “normal” he basically likes to get to know someone AND have a physical relationship immediately. My goal right now is to explore and put myself out there. I want the physical too, for now. 

When we talked he was honest about what he wants. I want to do the deed SO bad. Since it’s been a while. I really want it with someone that knows what they are doing. He wants to meet up this weekend; I’m excited but SUPER nervous. 

I’m having second thoughts not because he’s being a f-boy. I don’t mind. But I worry he’s all talk and it will be terrible or he’ll see me and not like me. 

Is this all futile? Any advice on how to have a better outlook and not be nervous? Any advice on being physical after not doing so in forever? 

Thank you.",dating
3462,"My (17F) boyfriend (18M) loves to get physical with me, and i just had my first experiences with some sexual activities, but i don’t get wet or feel aroused whenever i’m doing things with him, or while being around him.","Me and my boyfriend recently started to become really touchy and we ended up doing many things on the bed yesterday, like mutual masturbation, giving head, fondling and seeing each other’s bodies. However, i’m starting to question how i feel about him because i do not feel horny when i’m around him, neither do i get wet when he touches or plays with my clit, even when there is a lot of foreplay before we actually do those (no PIV btw). I really like touching his whole body and feeling it but i don’t feel aroused when it happens, whenever i’m making out with him or when he touches me. Even when i was helping him get off or when i was giving him head, he couldn’t finish and kept saying it feels like it’s coming but only when he did it himself Then he could finish, which made me kinda disappointed that i couldn’t do it for him. Still, i’m relatively new to this and that was just our first-time experience for both of us, so maybe i did it wrong? I’m still skeptical to whether he is actually physically attracted to me though. 

I don’t think we’ve connected deeply on an emotional level and i don’t feel like he’s giving me enough attention to make me feel things for him, even if i really enjoy spending time with him and showing him physical affection. However, whenever he does say things like “Can i give you a kiss later?” or when he clearly shows that he’s shy and blushing, or whenever he gives me gifts, i really like that and only then will i start to feel things for him. These make me consider not wanting to be in a serious relationship and commit to this, but i still like being around him, but he doesn’t really make me feel like he actually appreciates me or likes being around me, so i am very unsure.

I’m still young and have lots to learn, and i find myself wanting to please him a lot in bed, which might be part of the reason why i don’t enjoy it, but i don’t even feel aroused at all when i’m around him, even when not in bed, i just want to get into action yk. So i’m pretty scared of the next time we actually do these again. Am i really attracted to him and do i really want a relationship with commitments? Would really appreciate some advice rn or a new perspective.",dating

3464,About to give up on dating.,"Hey Reddit,  
  
I'm reaching out to this supportive community for some valuable insights and advice regarding my dating journey. Lately, I've been facing a few obstacles and could use some guidance on navigating them effectively.  
  
To provide some context, I've put significant effort into self-improvement and actively seeking romantic connections. I've approached numerous girls, participated in various social activities, worked on enhancing my communication skills, paid attention to my personal style, and focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, despite my best efforts, I've experienced my fair share of rejections and setbacks.  
  
One particular area that has proven challenging is online dating. Despite giving it a genuine try, I've encountered obstacles and struggled to achieve the desired results. Over the past months, my online dating experience has been disheartening, with limited matches and a lack of meaningful connections. I'm wondering if there are any specific strategies or approaches that others have found successful in overcoming these hurdles.  
  
Additionally, I've explored the possibility of meeting potential partners through my social network. While I have wonderful friends, it has been challenging to forge romantic connections with the people they know. I appreciate the support and efforts of my friends, but it can be discouraging when my romantic interests are not reciprocated within those circles.  
  
At this point, I'm seeking advice from the community on alternative strategies or approaches to improve my dating journey. Are there any areas of personal growth or different approaches that I might be overlooking? I'm open to hearing about your experiences, success stories, or any practical tips you can offer to increase my chances of finding genuine connections both online and offline.  
  
I understand that rejection is a natural part of the dating process, and setbacks are common for everyone. However, it's important for me to stay resilient and maintain a positive mindset. I'm committed to continuously improving myself and learning from each experience.  
  
Thank you in advance for your valuable support and guidance. I truly appreciate any insights you can provide to help me navigate these challenges and find meaningful connections.  
  
TL;DR: Despite efforts in various aspects of my dating life, I've encountered rejections and setbacks. Seeking advice from the community on strategies, experiences, or practical tips to overcome obstacles in online dating and forging romantic connections through my social network.",dating
3465,Was I wrong de-friended her?,"Hello, I have been thinking about something I did when results didn’t came to fruition. 

I was in college for my second degree and I was around my early 30s. I had a teacher who was the same age as her, and I was captivated by her beauty (smoking hot and all). After I graduated I stumble upon her when I was doing an internship, and kept in touch. We started talking and things got a little more “confident” even suggesting to go on to get some coffee; despite never set up a date, she never rejected the idea. Over the time whenever I wanted to talk to her, I noticed I was getting less and less response. Then later I find out that she got into a relationship, and it broke my enthusiasm of perusing. Eventually I decided to unfriend her and cut communications with her, after all I wasn’t getting any response. However I often doubt myself, as well having a gut feeling, that perhaps I should’ve not cut her; perhaps waited.",dating
3466,need advice on how to open up about weight fetish,"I’ll try and keep this brief while still conveying what I need to say

I like plus size women. While enjoying their figure is plenty, I personally would like to bring it up in dirty talk in the bedroom and things of that sort. I was in the dating scene a bit and I’m planning on jumping back in, and I would like to know how to approach this topic.

I am aware generally speaking that for most plus size women their weight is an insecurity to them, and even if you enjoy it it’s not something that really needs to be announced. I also know that fetishes of this degree don’t really need to be brought up until months in. My main concern is how can I bring this up or build up to it without triggering or hurting these women.

A relationship I was in went south because I went about it the wrong way, and a different women I asked about it essentially said that it was very weird to her. I don’t need the women to be into it or want it but I would like to learn how I can go about communicating it.

Any advice, especially from women or people in similar situations would be much appreciated. Thank you

Edit: I’m also open to answering questions or accepting dms if it means getting some decent advice",dating
3467,Too early??,"Okay, for some backstory long or short, I’ve struggled with mental health and (⚠️⚠️TW) sh for a while. Recently someone asked me to be their girlfriend and I have the most amazing heartfelt boyfriend.

3468,When they say they are taking a break from dating,"Both mid to late 20s. Have been talking to this girl for the last 1.5 month. We’ve seen each other 5
Times total, 3 dinners and 2 activities. Things seem to go very well every time we are in person. We use to have ~3 text exchanges per day at the beginning and then it went down to 1 per day and then recently have gotten 2 to 3 days gaps.  
So I definitely feel something was off and it had gotten hard to schedule things due to that.    
They would text back after the big gaps and apologize with reasons being they were tired, busy, not feeling great and finally they said they have not been feeling themselves and decided it’s best to take a step back from dating but open to staying friends and do the activity that we both enjoy.  

  
Though I do feel this could be genuine but it doesn’t matter if it is or not right? Best course of action is to keep it simple and move on and if we run into each other in the future then so be it.",dating

3470,Girl that Ghosted Me Apologized,"I (M27) was talking to this girl (F27) for about a month and a bit. Everything seemed like it was going well, and that we had some really good chemistry. But, she just started getting distant, she took days to reply to my messages, and we didn’t see each other for weeks after. 

I brought that all up with her, and she apologised and told me she had a lot going on in her life at the time, like starting a new job and moving to a new city. I understood and gave her all the space she needed. After a few days she reached out to me to make plans and I agreed. However, when I asked her to confirm them on the day she just didn’t respond to me at all. I didn’t reach out because I felt like I’d been played. 

Fast forward 2 and a half months and she’s reached out apologising for her behaviour towards me. I don’t know what I should do. Do I forgive her and tell her it’s fine? Or do I just forgive her and ghost her like she did me. I’m not really over the whole thing, because I really liked her and thought she was cool, but I don’t think going back to her is the right option. 

I do think I should forgive her, not for her but for myself and my own peace. What do you guys think I should do?",dating
3471,I [19M] have a pretty big crush on a girl [19F] I’ve been on 4 dates with but I don’t want to scare her away.,"Been seeing a girl I met through my band for a month or two now and I’m pretty romantically interested in her. Nothing major has really happened yet, just a lot of talking and joking with each other on our dates to restaurants and stuff. I brought her to meet my friends once and then she brought me to meet her friends a couple weeks later. Every date seems to go pretty well and we have a lot of the same interests which means we usually have a decent amount to talk about, there hasn’t been that many awkward silences. I was going to try and kiss her when we went on a walk through a park on one of our dates but chickened out, so her putting her head on my shoulder for a second to comfort me after a jokingly mean comment has been the extent of our physical contact so far. She doesn’t necessarily seem like she isn’t interested but she could just be naturally friendly/flirty with people. I want to make a move and tell her that I’m interested in taking things further (obviously letting her know that I’m fine with taking it slow) but I’m worried she will either A) not like me back or B) see me pretty much confessing as too forward or desperate and get creeped out. I don’t want to scare her away. Going on another date soon and was planning on talking to her about it then but now I’m not so sure after reading some articles/reddit posts online. How can I tell her I’m interested in taking it further without scaring her off?",dating
3472,Male Down on his luck,"So where do I begin haha. I was talking to this girl who I thought was super into me as I was her. Had a date planned out and everything in a week after I asked her out. 

I confessed to this girl I’ve been hurt before many times and I thought we were hitting it off. Turns out she has some “family stuff” and that she needs space. I give her space and she comes to me today saying she wants to just be friends and that she wants to experience her 20s her way. 

I totally get it. Just seems like one of those situations where I was too nice and couldn’t but screwed it up myself. I of course will still be friends with the girl but sucks. I would have rather never asked her out if this was going to happen.

He was a nice guy,and wanted to see me again. I just wasn’t interested,and the cat fishing had A LOT to do with it frankly.

3480,my ex who broke up with me to work on his depression sees me as his lifeline,"my ex (27m) of about 2 months broke up with me (23f) two weeks ago because his depression was getting out of control and he needed to work on himself. we were both very sad about the breakup, but agreed that it was the best thing to do and that there’s no hard feelings on either side - we still text occasionally just to check in on each other.

he texted me today to check in on me and my cat, and informed me he is still not doing well mentally but is trying his best to get better for us, and that “maybe one day it’ll all work” between us.

i am very happy he is getting help. i still care about him not as a boyfriend but as a good person, and it pained me to see how much he was suffering. but, i made it clear to him before the breakup that if he decides to break up with me, i won’t be putting my love life on pause indefinitely - i have actually recently started talking to other people.

i am worried that he’s going to see me and a potential relationship with me as a lifeline in his recovery, and if i am with someone else by the time he gets better, it’s going to break his heart and he’s going to spiral into depression and self harm again (he harmed himself after he proposed the breakup because it had made me sad). i reiterated that he should really focus on getting better for himself instead of for me, but i think he’s not getting the message, and i don’t want to directly tell him that i’m moving on when he is still in such an unstable state.

what should i do? i’m not saying i’m not open to trying again when he’s ready, but i definitely cannot guarantee that i’ll be waiting for him forever…",dating

3485,"Fun, first date ideas?? (DMV area)","Hi there! Hope everyone out there is having a nice day! 

I’ve met someone online dating (Bumble) back in March and we’ve been talking ever since. She lives near me. But she’s taken a break from her job as an elementary school teacher and she’s been visiting family in another country.

Anyways she’s coming back this weekend to Virginia and I honestly don’t want to blow my chances with her. It might be to premature to say this but I think she might be someone really special. :) 


[What are some great, first date ideas???]


I don’t want to set any expectations that this might end up with us being in a long-term relationship. But I do want to impress her and I want us to have a good time. :) She’s already said she wants to go out with me too. 

Obviously I can’t control the future but I would like to keep going on dates with her if we connect even more in person (maybe we’ll end up dating for real). We both are looking for a relationship. 



A little context: I am a 28 year old, handsome single male who just moved to the DC/NOVA area from California for work several months ago. I’ve have never had an actual long-term relationship before and I’ve only gone on 3-4 dates before with a woman. I am a naturally introverted person, INTJ, still a little shy. I have my share of insecurities but I try not to let those get the better of me. A close friend told me last night that I severely underrated myself because in his words “I am genuinely a nice, person”. 

My date: She is a pretty, young and petite elementary school teacher and she’s around my age. She is very cute, sweet, friendly, nice with a lot of love in her heart. She loves traveling, music, dancing, and her pets. 


Just some of the highlights from taking with her: 


- We talk at least twice a week (this week I showed her the cat our roommate and I got and she showed pics of her family’s dogs. She also sent me a cute picture of one of her kids homework assignments. She teaches little kids from Spanish speaking households. One of them wrote how to pronounce “ice cream” as “aiscream”).

- Her birthday is a day before mine and she invited me fly to see her and celebrate her birthday with her family and friends (I couldn’t go because I already had birthday plans, but she sent me pics of her special night). 

- We have sent songs that we like to each other. 

- She’s  planning a visit to Seattle later this year because she wants to move out of VA. I told her that I have some friends there and she said: 

“Go to Seattle, see your friend and meet me. It will be nice if I see some places with you in Seattle.”",dating
3486,Does anyone ever feel like doing things in friend groups holds them back with meeting others and dating in real life?,"I honestly rarely see anyone in person that I am immediately attracted to but recently I was hanging out with friends at a climbing gym and I saw the cutest guy I’ve seen in a while. I really really wanted to go up to him and chat, but since it’s a climbing gym he was kind of walking around the gym and I would’ve had to leave my group to go talk to him. It was just so hard because we were in the middle of a conversation and I didn’t know how to just end it and exit the conversation to go talk to this guy without being rude. I will say, this is more of a fresh friend group, so we’re not close enough for them to know my situation with dating. It was even more frustrating when they started bringing up their husbands, cause internally I was just like “Well, I’m trying to find one too, but y’all are makin it hard for me 🙄” The guy eventually left and I was so sad about it. I hate losing on opportunities like this (even if there’s a chance of getting rejected) because I’ve been single for so long and am almost desperate at this point. So it’s really frustrating, cause I might never see this guy again. I’m just gonna start doing things alone at this point, because my “friends” only wanna hangout when their husbands aren’t busy anyway.. I’m gonna start going to gyms alone, jazz shows, bars, and just anything from now on.. it’ll be so much easier to go up to guys and chat without being tied down to a group.
